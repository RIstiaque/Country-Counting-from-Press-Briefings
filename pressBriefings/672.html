GMT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good evening, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a useful and enjoyable day.\xc2\xa0 Today we have a special guest, in addition to Ben Rhodes, with whom you\xe2\x80\x99re very familiar -- Deputy National Security Advisor -- we have the Administrator of USAID, Raj Shah, who\xe2\x80\x99s here to preview some of what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m going to turn it over to Ben, who will then turn it over to Raj.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll be here to take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get started here.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say a few quick words and then hand it over to Raj.\xc2\xa0 We really just wanted to give you some additional context on what the President is doing here in Senegal and what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing tomorrow morning at our food security event.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say a few things.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us underscore that this trip is about lifting up our efforts to increase trade and investment in Africa, to strengthen democratic institutions in Africa, to invest in young people, and to renew a more robust U.S. engagement in an emerging part of the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as we look at this trip, essentially, each day really hits on one of the major themes that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to convey here in Africa.\xc2\xa0 Today was very much focused on democratic institutions.\xc2\xa0 And Senegal has been a model in terms of its peaceful transition to democracy.\xc2\xa0 And by meeting with the President, but also with judicial leaders from across Africa, as well as civil society leaders in Gor\xc3\xa9e Island, the President was conveying the breadth of the progress that needs to be made in democracy.\xc2\xa0 And much of that is being done here in Senegal, but it goes beyond leaders and elections to independent judiciaries, the rule of law, a strong civil society.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTomorrow will be focused on food security, one of our signature development efforts here in Africa and one that is directly relevant not just to lifting people out of poverty, but to promoting economic growth.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn Johannesburg, at the President\xe2\x80\x99s town hall, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be focused on young people and the type of exchange programs that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking to expand.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll address that in his town hall.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThen, in Cape Town, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be speaking broadly to the U.S. partnership with Africa.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll touch on all of these aspects of our policy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThen, in Tanzania, of course, he\xe2\x80\x99ll do a forum with CEOs and business leaders from Africa and the United States to discuss how we can increase trade and investment -- another pillar of our strategy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo you really see the different elements of what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here in Africa represented in the events that we\xe2\x80\x99re undertaking.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d also add global health being a focus in our event in Cape Town with Archbishop Tutu.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other point I\xe2\x80\x99d just make is tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s event brings in private sector leaders.\xc2\xa0 A lot of what we do is in the public-private space, given the interest in U.S. companies in Africa and also the demand signal here in Africa for partnership with the private sector.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThen, in South Africa, we\xe2\x80\x99ll also be doing an independent event with Valerie Jarrett, Mike Froman, Fred Hochberg, Elizabeth Littlefield, Raj, and members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic team to discuss ways to deepen U.S. trade and investment.\xc2\xa0 And then, of course, the event in Tanzania.\xc2\xa0 So in all three countries we\xe2\x80\x99re bringing in U.S. businesses, the private sector to our discussions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hand it over to Raj to give you an overview of our food security efforts and what AID is up to.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll hand it over to Raj.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDR. SHAH:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 I just want to give you a little bit of background for tomorrow morning\xe2\x80\x99s event where the President will be with business leaders and agricultural ministers from across the continent and from West Africa in particular.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has made addressing hunger through business and science a real focus since 2009.\xc2\xa0 And in Senegal, more than 65 percent of the population lives in rural communities, depends on agriculture for their livelihoods.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLast year, at the Camp David G8 Summit, the President joined other G8 leaders, African heads of state, the African Union and the private sector to pull together and launch something we call the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition.\xc2\xa0 And this was an ambitious effort to couple really tough policy reforms that countries would make -- reforms like making the kinds of changes to their tax code, and fighting corruption that would allow private businesses to have more confidence to invest, and to couple that with private investment commitments to make investments specifically in food and agriculture to address hunger and food insecurity.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur goal at that time was to lift 50 million people out of poverty and hunger in sub-Saharan Africa through that initiative.\xc2\xa0 In its first year, it was launched with three countries at last year\xe2\x80\x99s G8 -- Ethiopia, Ghana and Tanzania.\xc2\xa0 Since then, it has more than tripled in size with Burkina Faso, Cote d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire and Mozambique joining at this year\xe2\x80\x99s G8 meeting; and Benin, Malawi and Nigeria also joining at that time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTomorrow, the President will be able to announce that Senegal is now joining the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition.\xc2\xa0 In the last 12 months, what that has meant is that it allows companies to come together, and they have -- more than 70 companies have made commitments of $3.7 billion to these New Alliance countries to make investments in seed systems and agricultural processing and agricultural marketing.\xc2\xa0 And those investments are already making a huge difference throughout Africa.\xc2\xa0 One example is DuPont has opened a state-of-the-art seed production and distribution facility in Ethiopia, and already nearly reached nearly 40,000 farmers with improved seed varieties that have helped them double the amount of food they produce for their families and for their commercial markets.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are dozens of examples like that, but what\'s important about tomorrow\'s session is Senegal has agreed, as part of joining the New Alliance, to change some of its laws and regulations -- to expand access to credit for small-scale farmers; to reduce and to better target subsidies for fertilizers and seed; and to fight corruption in the subsidy system; and to offer tax exemptions in its value-added tax system to enable more companies to make investments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs a result, tomorrow, companies -- a series of private companies will announce that they\'re making $134 million of investment commitments in Senegal\'s agricultural system, and the United States will continue to provide the broad support we\'ve provided for food and agriculture here in Senegal, announcing a new $47-million commitment to expand access to new seeds and other agricultural technologies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat grant will be to the Alliance for a Green Revolution for Africa, and it will allow a series of countries to double access, to improve seeds in rice, sweet potato and other types of crops -- some of which the President will see and talk to farmers tomorrow morning.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFinally, I would just say that, on a global basis, the President made a commitment in 2009 to get the world to focus on fighting hunger through business and science.\xc2\xa0 And at the time, we launched a program called Feed the Future, and the President committed $3.5 billion of American investment in that effort.\xc2\xa0 Since then -- and tomorrow we\'ll release a report that details this -- we have been operating in 19 countries, and we work in countries that are willing to be good partners and make changes to the way they do business.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll show tomorrow that the effort has already reached 7 million farm households, allowing them to increase their food production by 50, 60 or 70 percent.\xc2\xa0 And the result of this has been improved nutrition for 12 million kids.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd when the President announced this in 2009, he said the goal of our effort should be to move away from food aid and assistance, and move toward self-sufficiency, private enterprise, and broad-based economic growth.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely what this effort seeks to do, and has already raised billions of dollars in private investments in order to move in that direction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'re excited to have the opportunity for the President to speak tomorrow with business leaders and agricultural ministers from across the continent, and welcome Senegal to the New Alliance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Nedra.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, I\'m wondering if you could talk a little bit about the President\'s language today; it was a little dismissive of Snowden.\xc2\xa0 And maybe you could explain his thinking behind that a little bit?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is he acknowledging maybe that he\'s not going to be extradited, or maybe he\'s trying to reach out to Russia?\xc2\xa0 Or I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he was trying to send a message to folks in the United States who might be civil libertarians, or -- anything you can say about that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, look, I mean, I think the President covered this.\xc2\xa0 I guess what I would say about this is we believe Mr. Snowden has committed a crime; that the release of unauthorized classified information like this is harmful to national security, and therefore it\'s important for nations to cooperate with us to bring him to justice. And there are -- I think the point the President was making is there are established practices for doing that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou can handle this through legal channels; that this is an individual who committed a crime under our law, an individual who is traveling, as you know, without appropriate documentation.\xc2\xa0 And so there\'s ample basis for Russia to expel him, and for Russia and other countries to cooperate with us in bringing him to justice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the point the President was making is that this can be handled through those appropriate channels; that while we are, in addition to being interested in bringing him to justice, very focused on the harm done by this disclosure.\xc2\xa0 That harm has largely been put into the public domain by the revelation of these programs.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, we have mechanisms for securing this type of information that don\xe2\x80\x99t involve somebody taking them with them to Hong Kong and into Russia and releasing them publicly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo clearly, the compromise of the classification has taken place.\xc2\xa0 What we want to do now is bring this individual to justice.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\'s point was simply that we can do that through established practices rather than necessarily making this the preeminent issue in our bilateral relations with a range of countries around the world.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It just seems a little bit like a downgrading of the language.\xc2\xa0 I mean, Secretary Kerry was calling him a "traitor to his nation," and now the President is saying, you know, he\'s a 29-year-old hacker.\xc2\xa0 So does that signify some sort of change in the view from the United States on him?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think that there\'s a baseline view that individuals who make an oath to protect classified information need to keep that promise.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the basis upon which we are able to carry out our intelligence operations and have an intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 And so we take very seriously the compromise of that type of information.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, in Mr. Snowden\'s case, he has carried out that unauthorized disclosure.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the Department of Justice has an investigation into his actions.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we would like countries to cooperate with us to expel him and bring him to justice here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\'s point was that in the context of our bilateral relations with Russia and China, we can handle this through the appropriate channels, and it needs to be seen in the context of very broad and complex relations with these countries.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we\xe2\x80\x99re not seriously disappointed, for instance, in what the authorities did in Hong Kong and Beijing in letting Mr. Snowden go.\xc2\xa0 I think the President was speaking to the nature in which -- the way in which we\xe2\x80\x99re carrying out our efforts to bring this individual to justice here in the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, following up on his language, he also said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be \xe2\x80\x9cwheeling and dealing\xe2\x80\x9d with leaders in China and Russia.\xc2\xa0 Has there been any suggestion from either of those countries that there is something to be wheeled and dealed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think the point that the President makes here is, as he said, number one, he should not have to get involved because, frankly, this should be resolved through the appropriate legal channels; and number two, this should be resolved on the basis that this individual is traveling without appropriate documents and violated our laws, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation underway by the Department of Justice, so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t see any linkages to other issues.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that comment echoed by the Russians, who have said that they don\xe2\x80\x99t want this to harm bilateral relations.\xc2\xa0 What we would like the Russians to do is expel Mr. Snowden and allow him to be brought to justice here in the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there a sense at all from listening to his language today that he\'s trying to lower tensions or any potential tensions with both of those countries?\xc2\xa0 This comes after just last week you guys said -- or Jay said at the podium -- that this will hurt U.S.-China relations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we made that point clear about U.S.-China relations, because, again, the authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong allowed him to leave even though we had a legitimate request for extradition with Hong Kong.\xc2\xa0 So we continue to have those serious concerns with China, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to raise with them.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith Russia, we still would like them to do the right thing in expelling Mr. Snowden and permitting him to be brought to justice here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 I think an additional piece of context here is that, for instance, the President was asked about a military operation to apprehend this individual.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, that would go beyond the nature of what this is, which is a law enforcement matter that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to resolve through law enforcement channels.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if it hurt relations with China that they allowed him to go, will it hurt relations with Russia if Russia allows him to transit to some other country?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, clearly, we have an ongoing situation in which we\xe2\x80\x99re talking to the Russians about our desire for them to expel Mr. Snowden, permit him to be brought to justice here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that even though we don\xe2\x80\x99t have an extradition treaty with them formally, we have had law enforcement cooperation in the past.\xc2\xa0 And so we would like to see them move forward in that spirit of cooperation, as we have, frankly, in returning individuals to Russia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate on what would happen on the back end of that process because it\xe2\x80\x99s still an ongoing situation, but clearly we -- our very strong preference, of course, is for the Russians to work with us through that law enforcement channel and to allow Mr. Snowden to be brought to justice here in the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what has been the highest level of contact with the Russians, is it Mueller?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into all of our contacts, but, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s the main -- the appropriate channel is through the Department of Justice and the FBI, and Director Mueller has been a part of that effort.\xc2\xa0 And again, we believe that that provides the basis for resolving this issue with the Russians.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the suggestion from Hong Kong that the middle name was wrong?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the authorities in Hong Kong knew full well who Mr. Snowden was.\xc2\xa0 They knew full well that we had an extradition request to see him brought to the United States because of the crimes that he has committed.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Justice will have to speak to the specifics of their request.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is, again, it was an appropriately processed request, but it\xe2\x80\x99s simply not credible to assert that they somehow didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to discern who this individual was on that basis.\xc2\xa0 Everybody was fully aware of Mr. Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s presence in Hong Kong and what he had done and our desire in seeing him extradited to the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last one, because I was a little confused also with what the President said today.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing for all this time so much concern about what Snowden still has on those hard drives, the knowledge that he has.\xc2\xa0 The President today seemed to suggest that basically the worst of the damage is already done with what he\xe2\x80\x99s already leaked out.\xc2\xa0 Is that our feeling now, there\xe2\x80\x99s not much more that he has?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know with certainty what Mr. Snowden has.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re actively seeking to determine.\xc2\xa0 I think suffice to say -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99d make two points, Jon.\xc2\xa0 Number one, he\xe2\x80\x99s already revealed very classified programs that are designed to be secret so that we\xe2\x80\x99re not broadcasting to our adversaries the nature and methods of our intelligence collection.\xc2\xa0 And number two, he\xe2\x80\x99s clearly compromised the security of whatever he has by taking it with him to Hong Kong and now to Russia.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we have very strict protocols for how to handle classified information.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t involve getting on a plane and going to Hong Kong and then getting on a plane and going to Russia.\xc2\xa0 So this individual has already not just acted in a way that released unauthorized information, but is clearly not handling classified information appropriately.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House talking to Russia about the possibility of expelling Snowden to a third country with which you do have an extradition treaty as a kind of face-saving way out of this?\xc2\xa0 And on the Macky Sall talks, did the President talk to them about this Senegal trial for Hiss\xc3\xa8ne Habr\xc3\xa9?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 On the second question, this is a trial that we have supported, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve welcomed Senegal\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in undertaking this effort to see that justice is done.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, we have committed resources to support their efforts.\xc2\xa0 So it came up in the context of the President commending Senegal working with us and others to see that justice is done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn your first question, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the nature of our contacts with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 Our bottom line is we believe there\xe2\x80\x99s a basis for us, through law enforcement cooperation, to see that Mr. Snowden is expelled in a way that allows him to be brought to justice, and that\xe2\x80\x99s our ultimate priority, and the Russians certainly understand that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMargaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about to what extent the Presidents today talked about drone bases in Africa or any specific Senegalese military cooperation as it would involve Mali?\xc2\xa0 And second of all, can you discuss, with regards to Nelson Mandela, what contact the White House is having and with whom?\xc2\xa0 How are you checking in on his condition and what to do about arriving in South Africa?\xc2\xa0 Are you going with his family or with the Zuma administration or both?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 On your first question, what they spoke about in terms of the security situation in North Africa was our support for Senegal\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the peacekeeping effort that\xe2\x80\x99s underway in Mali.\xc2\xa0 They have 500 peacekeepers serving in Mali.\xc2\xa0 We believe it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that a number of things happen there.\xc2\xa0 Number one, that there\xe2\x80\x99s a political process inside of Mali that allows for a democratic government to emerge and reconciliation to take place.\xc2\xa0 Number two, that in the aftermath of the French-led intervention, there is a strong regional peacekeeping force that is put in place.\xc2\xa0 And Senegal has really stepped up, along with a number of other countries in the region.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the type of leadership that we want to support because it demonstrates African countries taking responsibility for security challenges in their neighborhoods, and ultimately it leads to more sustainable solutions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat the President indicated is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to provide the support that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been investing in this operation.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided is, for instance, logistical support and other types of backing for those nations that are putting peacekeepers into Mali.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs a general matter, I think the terrorism issue sometimes gets overstated here, frankly, in Africa.\xc2\xa0 We cover a very broad agenda with these countries, from development to food security, global health, economic growth, trade, investment.\xc2\xa0 Terrorism is an element of that discussion, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really a focal point.\xc2\xa0 What we really heard from President Sall today is his reform agenda and how we can work with him to strengthen democratic institutions and trade and investment.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did they discuss drones at any length?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything -- did Sall raise concerns about it?\xc2\xa0 Or is there anything we\xe2\x80\x99re asking Senegal --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Raj, you were -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then, on Nelson Mandela, look, we have been -- our view on this is that we are going to completely defer to the wishes of the Mandela family and work with the South African government as relates to our visit.\xc2\xa0 So essentially, our approach is whatever the Mandela family deems appropriate, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on doing in terms of our interaction with them.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of our trip, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously in very close cooperation with the government because they\xe2\x80\x99re facilitating the very significant presence that is associated with a U.S. visit and the meetings associated with that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- we\xe2\x80\x99re deferring to them on all these questions of health.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not at all involved in those discussions.\xc2\xa0 So frankly, we learn information as the world learns the information from the family and the government of South Africa.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI will say that it does add a significant amount of profundity for the President to be able to visit Robben Island while he\xe2\x80\x99s in Cape Town and to reflect on the sacrifice that Nelson Mandela made when he was there, and to have the opportunity to take his family there and mark that moment.\xc2\xa0 Because not only has Nelson Mandela been a hero to the President, as he said today, he is the very demonstration of the promise that you see across Africa -- of democratic governance, of reconciliation, of growth and opportunity for young people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think the President will deeply treasure any opportunity he has to celebrate that legacy.\xc2\xa0 And his focus right now is on expressing support for the family in a very difficult time.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what have you heard from the family as of this moment?\xc2\xa0 Will it be like a moment-by-moment?\xc2\xa0 When will you decide whether you can visit the family?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to characterize those discussions.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\'re really just going to see what the best thing to do is while we\'re there in Johannesburg and in Cape Town.\xc2\xa0 And the President will be certainly speaking to the legacy of Nelson Mandela, the profound influence that Nelson Mandela has had on him personally but also South Africa, the United States and the world.\xc2\xa0 And that will be a significant part of our time in South Africa.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to the family, that\xe2\x80\x99s something we\'ll just have to work through with them as we move forward with our trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know some of the folks that you all brought here from the administration -- USAID, other -- are people about trade and investment, but I wondered if you all invited -- or if there are other people here we don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that are from the private sector?\xc2\xa0 The reason I ask is the Chamber of Commerce has sort of complained a little bit.\xc2\xa0 They are really interested particularly in that Tanzania event on electricity, and that they would have loved to come but they sort of felt like they were not invited.\xc2\xa0 Could you just --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ll get you -- Raj should discuss the event tomorrow on the private sector participation.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll get you, as we move forward, the types of companies that are represented in Tanzania and South Africa.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure we had discussions with the Chamber, but there are very significant U.S. business leaders, CEOs who are going to be participating in Tanzania, as well as regional leaders as well.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, Raj, you may want to talk about tomorrow.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they coming from the U.S. or they\'re based here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Some of them are coming from the U.S., some of them are based here.\xc2\xa0 And I think that speaks to the dynamic we\'re trying to foster, which is that there is significant attention from the headquarters of U.S. businesses that want to do more in Africa, and there is a significant presence here of multinational and U.S. businesses that have branch offices and representation across the continent.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut then there are also African entrepreneurs and African business leaders, and we want to bring those folks together to have a continued dialogue about how can we break down barriers to trade; how can we increase U.S. investment; what is the type of climate that needs to exist for that investment; how are we focusing our partnership with African governments on the type of infrastructure development and customs regimes that facilitate growth and job creation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut Raj will speak to tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDR. SHAH:\xc2\xa0 It\'s actually the same answer for tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 We reached out to CEOs and companies throughout the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa.\xc2\xa0 There are about 72, now, companies that are part of this New Alliance, and a subset of them will be represented tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Some have chosen to send CEO-level folks from around the world; others have -- most have focused on sending their Africa lead, their regional lead -- usually from somewhere based outside of Dakar -- to the meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask a question about corruption, particularly in democratic governments in Africa, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, and how it relates to national security.\xc2\xa0 We\'re hearing that corruption is still a very real problem here, particularly in areas that have democratic pull.\xc2\xa0 What is the -- what is your office doing?\xc2\xa0 Was the President talking about in his meeting with President Sall as well as the other presidents about corruption?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll say a couple of comments, and then Raj I\'m sure will want to weigh in, because a lot of what AID does is focus on this issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe first thing I\'d say is that this is something the President has raised for many years, dating back to his trip to Kenya as a senator.\xc2\xa0 And it was a focus of his speech in Accra, and it\'s been a focus of our policy in Africa.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe believe that corruption is one of the greatest threats to growth and democracy in many African countries, and when the President talks about the need to have a focus on democracy that addresses what happens in between elections, a lot of what he\'s talking about is how do you combat corruption.\xc2\xa0 So one of the reasons to have the meeting, for instance, say, with the independent judiciary leaders, is how are you setting up a rule of law framework in these countries that ensures that individuals have confidence that they can start a business without paying a bribe, or that people have confidence that they can send their kid to school without paying a bribe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that is going to be a step that is necessary, both to allow for confidence in democratic governments here in Africa so that citizens believe that governments are serving them.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s also going to be necessary for increased trade and investment, because U.S. businesses want to have a predictable investment climate.\xc2\xa0 They want to know that they have the certainty that comes with the rule of law.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be engaged in business in areas that have significant corruption.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo Africa will be able to take off as a growth model the more that it combats corruption.\xc2\xa0 In Senegal here, they\'ve done a lot to do so.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve been a leader in that regard.\xc2\xa0 But, Raj, you may want to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDR. SHAH:\xc2\xa0 I would just add that the President launched the Open Government Partnership a number of years ago, and it\'s an effort to basically get governments to commit to fight corruption and be transparent in how they work, and we then work with those governments to help them achieve the standards required to join the partnership.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSenegal has expressed a commitment to join the Open Government Partnership, and has taken a number of steps, including applying for membership in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, making certain types of government meetings and data and information more accessible.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re working actively with them in a variety of programs to help implement the conditions of the Open Government Partnership.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tToday, in the meeting with civil society leaders, the President talked about and heard about how our investments in those civil society organizations have helped them fight corruption, and also heard about some high-profile corruption cases.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s an important step forward and it\xe2\x80\x99s an important aspect.\xc2\xa0 And as Ben points out, and tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s food security meeting is a good example, one of the commitments Senegal has made is to restructure its subsidy system for agriculture, which is they\xe2\x80\x99re doing that in part to fight corruption in that system so that you can have a business climate that\xe2\x80\x99s more amenable to the companies that have made $134 million of investment commitments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I want to ask you a question on that though.\xc2\xa0 Quantitatively, how much of I guess I would say -- well, I want to quantify sub-Saharan Africa, then Africa as the whole, the continent.\xc2\xa0 Quantitatively, how much corruption, percentage-wise, do you think there is here?\xc2\xa0 And has it gotten better, or has it gotten worse, or has it stayed the same since you started the partnership?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDR. SHAH:\xc2\xa0 I think without question, it has gotten better since we started the partnership.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, across the board, even countries that have been highly associated with high rankings on various corruption indices have taken important steps, like Nigeria in the energy sector, for example, to actually fight corruption as part of various programs we\xe2\x80\x99ve put in place.\xc2\xa0 And for us, across the board, this has been more and more a condition for our capacity to bring private investment, trade and development aid to those countries.\xc2\xa0 And we could share more details on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, can you quantify -- I mean, since it\'s such a --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDR. SHAH:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to offer an aggregate quantification of how much corruption is there.\xc2\xa0 What we do know is in the fastest-growing African economies, we are seeing that growth and investment correlated with active steps to fight corruption, with steps to make public the basic budget systems; putting in place, like in the energy sector in Nigeria, transparent procurement systems for how contracts are bid out and how they interact with companies.\xc2\xa0 Now American companies are able to participate in that because it\xe2\x80\x99s all transparent.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we see important examples of real success, and we know the trend overall has been a positive one.\xc2\xa0 But the President raises it in every interaction because it\xe2\x80\x99s critical to expanding trade and investment.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Anything else?\xc2\xa0 Yes, in the back.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 Is Zimbabwe is on the agenda for the talks with President Zuma?\xc2\xa0 What will be the message that the President wants to deliver, both to him on Zimbabwe next door, because Zimbabwe is -- and also, could you just sketch out -- I know it\'s two or three days away -- the Cape Town speech, is that going to be kind of a Cairo speech for this trip?\xc2\xa0 He spoke in Ghana, Cairo, so can you sketch out for us on those?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 On the first question, I definitely expect that Zimbabwe will come up in the course of our visit to South Africa.\xc2\xa0 We have been -- well, first of all, frankly, when you look at the issues we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing here -- democracy and corruption -- the contrast could not be clearer.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn Zimbabwe -- where you have deeply undemocratic practices that have been pursued in the past, very questionable elections, crackdowns on independent media and civil society -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen systemic corruption, and that has led to an economy that is lagging behind many of the growth stories in Africa.\xc2\xa0 So I think it makes our point about the correlation between strong democratic governance and economic growth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of where we are now, there\xe2\x80\x99s a constitution in place in Zimbabwe.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a commitment to hold an election.\xc2\xa0 Our position is going to be that that election has to be free, fair and credible, and there has to be a means of establishing that that is the case, but also that democracy goes beyond elections, so we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see space for independent media, for civil society and for those elements of democracy to exist within Zimbabwe as they do within South Africa and Senegal.\xc2\xa0 So that will be our position on Zimbabwe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn the speech, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more time to speak to it.\xc2\xa0 I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s a chance for him to talk to people in South Africa and the broader continent about the vision of the future that the President has in terms of what type of partnership do we want with Africa?\xc2\xa0 What type of partnership do we want on issues of economic growth and trade and investment?\xc2\xa0 What type of partnerships do we want in strengthening democratic institutions, and also in dealing with peace and security challenges?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll carry forward these themes of -- Africa is very much on the move.\xc2\xa0 There are significant positive stories taking place across the continent.\xc2\xa0 But some of that progress is very fragile, and some of that progress can be put at risk if there is not a sustained momentum behind the types of things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about here today.\xc2\xa0 And I think a key element of that will be young people, given the fact that over 60 percent of Africa\xe2\x80\x99s population is under 25.\xc2\xa0 This is really a series of decisions that young people will have to make about the future of Africa.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, I think all of this is very much directly connected to the legacy that Nelson Mandela has built in establishing not just democracy, but a democracy in which there was a peaceful transfer of power, in which there was reconciliation, in which people accomplished things that nobody could have foreseen decades ago.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an example, a shining example for all of Africa and the world, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s one that the President will continue to speak to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got time for one or -- well, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you do to erase this perception that the President has been somewhat absent from Africa?\xc2\xa0 Obviously, you probably saw the New York Times story this morning, and I got the impression, and so did the President, by one of his comments at the press conference.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s it going to take for that perception to be erased?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it starts with this trip.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no substitute for being here.\xc2\xa0 We have done a ton of work in Africa.\xc2\xa0 Raj, you must spend more time here than any other part of the world.\xc2\xa0 The United States has been significantly invested in global health, food security, trade and investment.\xc2\xa0 But the President of the United States, there\xe2\x80\x99s no substitute for him being here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think the way in which we address that, Chuck, is in what we do and say throughout the course of this trip, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to move forward different pieces of our agenda on this trip.\xc2\xa0 But we also have to demonstrate that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to lead to follow through.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd one of the reasons that, for instance, the President wanted to bring so many members of his economic team here is to signal that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a sustained engagement from the top members of his administration on the economic side, on the trade side, particularly as we get into things like renewing AGOA, pursuing the type of trade agreements you heard him reference today with ECOWAS -- so demonstrating that follow-through at the Cabinet level, demonstrating that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be personally engaged, and continued outreach to his fellow leaders in Africa.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, maintaining these commitments that we\xe2\x80\x99ve established in this administration, which we believe provides the best model of partnership for Africa because we\xe2\x80\x99re investing in trade and investment here -- we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on trade and investment here in Africa that will lead to broader-based economic growth.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just focused on, for instance, a resource base; it\xe2\x80\x99s focused on deeper connections among our businesses which will lead to employment on both sides of the ocean, on democratic institutions.\xc2\xa0 That leads to a broader base of civic participation, greater confidence that people can have in their governments and in their future.\xc2\xa0 And on peace and security, we\xe2\x80\x99re empowering African solutions to these problems so that African regional organizations and African governments can step up as Senegal is in Mali, as ECOWAS did in Cote d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire, as the African Union did in Sudan, and as they\xe2\x80\x99re also doing in Somalia, for instance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to Mandela and the situation in South Africa, to what extent do you anticipate that the tone of the President\xe2\x80\x99s message or perhaps even the schedule will be affected by Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s precarious condition?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The schedule -- we have no scheduling changes to update you on.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously be, as I said, very deferential to the developments that take place and to the wishes of the family and the South African government.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLook, I think the tone is one of deep and profound respect for Nelson Mandela and all that he\xe2\x80\x99s achieved, and the South Africa that he, more than anyone else, helped to build; and the fact that the United States deeply values those contributions, deeply values its relationship with South Africa.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, just to finish Chuck\xe2\x80\x99s point, we want to carry forward initiatives.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re launching some new efforts while we\xe2\x80\x99re here.\xc2\xa0 But we need to show follow-through.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that if we do show that follow-through, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a significant success story in terms of our ability to advance our own interests but also to help Africa take that next step towards much greater prosperity and democratic governance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you acknowledge you guys could have started this process a couple years ago?\xc2\xa0 That in an ideal world he would have been here in his first term, which I know was loosely on this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Raj -- I mean, Raj may want to speak to this.\xc2\xa0 All I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is that we were able to get to Ghana.\xc2\xa0 We were able to host groupings of democratic African leaders.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you look at what we did in the first term, at the presidential level we hosted different groupings of democratic leaders from Africa in the White House, in the Oval Office, in addition to his young African leaders town hall, which he brought young people from across Africa to the White House.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo he\xe2\x80\x99s been engaged on these core themes that we have of democratic governance, of young people, of promoting trade and investment.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, when you\xe2\x80\x99re ending two wars and prosecuting an effort against al Qaeda and dealing with a very complex international environment, part of the opportunity that comes from winding down those efforts is being more engaged in Africa at the presidential level, so that as you close out the Iraq war, as we\xe2\x80\x99re winding down Afghanistan -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about our efforts to pivot to Asia in terms of resources and attention.\xc2\xa0 Africa is another one of those emerging regions that\'s going to have to take up more of our attention as we come out of the period in U.S. foreign policy that we\'ve been in.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDR. SHAH:\xc2\xa0 I would just add a few thoughts.\xc2\xa0 The first is the President started the focus on food security in 2009, in the spring of 2009.\xc2\xa0 And since then, of the 19 countries we focus on, 14 are in sub-Saharan Africa.\xc2\xa0 And the vast majority of the focus and resources have been effectively deployed in that context.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s been very consistent.\xc2\xa0 We have followed through and actually delivered outcomes that are -- when you look back on what can you achieve in three or four years of sustained effort, quite significant relative even to big past efforts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSecond, I\'d say that the model the President has deployed has been getting public-private partnerships engaged and more active from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s been something that he has spent a lot of time on, we\'ve all spent a lot of time on across the administration, with the Millennium Challenge Corporation -- OPIC and Ex-Im -- and all of those leaders of those institutions will be with us in South Africa, and I believe in Tanzania as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the third thing I would say is -- and this is perhaps less visible -- but Africa has seen a steady and consistent increase in our overall resource investment each year that we\'ve been in office.\xc2\xa0 And sustaining that in this political climate has required real tradeoffs to be made in other areas, but we\'ve done that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re probably the only G8 country to have achieved that kind of a sustained focus and investment that we believe is delivering real results, and that we measure and report on outcomes to demonstrate that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, you\'re saying more U.S. public money?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDR. SHAH:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Since 2004, there was a set of commitments called the Gleneagles Commitments.\xc2\xa0 And America met its Gleneagles obligations ahead of schedule.\xc2\xa0 And our administration has sustained those public investments in Africa at a very high level, and overall has increased our public level of investment in Africa.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do we have more in same terms -- do we have more money going to Africa now than we did during the Bush years?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDR. SHAH:\xc2\xa0 If you look at the foreign assistance portfolio, we do.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I just get a clarification?\xc2\xa0 You said a mind-boggling number, a goal of 50 million people out of poverty or hunger as part of the New Alliance for Food Security.\xc2\xa0 During what kind of a time period are we talking about?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDR. SHAH:\xc2\xa0 That was designed to take place between last year and 10 years from then, so 2022.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have an estimate of where you are now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDR. SHAH:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re actually quite on path.\xc2\xa0 I, for one, believe we\'ll exceed that path.\xc2\xa0 The President has consistently reminded people that if you double crop yields in sub-Saharan Africa, you can relatively quickly move large numbers of people out of hunger and poverty, and do it without providing humanitarian aid -- helping them produce more food and build modern food systems -- which is why tomorrow\'s Feed the Future report that shows that we\'ve reached 7 million farm households and helped them get a significant improvement in their food production is a good example of that.\xc2\xa0 And the President will see tomorrow and talk about specific, new rice varieties that we\'ve helped develop in partnership with Africa and introduced right here in Senegal that has produced enough -- about 100,000 extra metric tons of food and we believe will allow Senegal to achieve food security in just a few years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'ve seen some extraordinary progress often based in science and business investment.\xc2\xa0 And that will continue to be our focus.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We have to wrap up.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a good point to end on, because I think the actions have been there and increasing resources on global health and launching food security and on deepening these trade investment partnerships.\xc2\xa0 I think what you see now is a presidential overlay through this trip.\xc2\xa0 And you\'re going to see a lot of follow through coming out of this trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\'ll just make one announcement as we wrap here.\xc2\xa0 You\'ll see an announcement go out later today that our nominee for ambassador to South Africa will be Patrick Gaspard.\xc2\xa0 Many of you know Patrick.\xc2\xa0 He has been the executive director of the DNC since 2011, previously assistant to the President and director of the Office of Political Affairs from 2009-2011, and prior to that, National Political Director for Obama for America -- so somebody who is close to the President, somebody who cares deeply about South Africa and I think demonstrates the President\'s personal engagement in this relationship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hadn\'t that already been announced?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did it take so long for him to be announced?\xc2\xa0 We knew like last year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Hey, man, I\'m just telling you the news.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re announcing it today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we\'re announcing that today.\xc2\xa0 Yes, this is official today.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nominations sent to the U.S. Senate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 That process is moving forward now.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you sure?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure.\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\'s why I told you, April.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just trying to keep you informed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t7:07 P.M.
