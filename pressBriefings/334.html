EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\'s nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 I do not have any announcements at the top, Josh, so let\xe2\x80\x99s go straight to your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner has announced that Pope Francis will deliver a speech to a joint session of Congress in September, becoming the first Pope to do that.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering, does the White House have any reaction to that, and was that visit coordinated with the White House in advance?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Didn\xe2\x80\x99t used to have to ask those questions, did we?\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President and his team here at the White House have been anticipating a visit from Pope Francis here to the United States for quite some time, and even as far back as the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the Vatican, where he first met Pope Francis, talked about how eager he was to welcome the Pope to the United States.\xc2\xa0 So the President is certainly looking forward to his visit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some talk on the Hill about this new authorization for use of military force that the administration is seeking.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Pelosi is talking about negotiations around a three-year agreement that would focus on Islamic State militants.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if you have any thoughts on how that AUMF is shaping up and specifically on that three-year time frame.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Josh, anytime you see details starting to leak off the Hill it\'s an indication that there have been an increasing number of conversations between administration officials and officials on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 That is follow-up from some of the work that grew from the bipartisan leadership meeting that the President convened here at the White House two or three weeks ago where they discussed essentially the idea that the administration would work with Democrats and Republicans on the Hill on a piece of language that the White House could submit to Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 And that work is ongoing.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress in that regard and, as I mentioned yesterday at the briefing, I would anticipate that we\'ll have specific language that we\'ll send up to Capitol Hill relatively soon.\xc2\xa0 I believe at that point, we would be in a position to make that language public, and then I\'ll be in a better position to actually discuss what\xe2\x80\x99s included and why it\'s included.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a position about whether the original AUMF that was used for Iraq from 2002, whether that should be repealed as part of having a new AUMF?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has made the case previously that he does support the repeal of the 2002 AUMF.\xc2\xa0 And this was in the context of a speech that he gave a year or two ago talking about the need to review some of these policies that have I think the unintended effect of keeping the United States on sort of this permanent war footing.\xc2\xa0 And the President has talked about how he wants to place a priority on trying to reform some of those policies in a way that acknowledges that we don\'t have to be on this sort of permanent war footing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSome of these are steps the President obviously can take on his own, such as winding down the troop presence in Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously have made substantial progress in that regard.\xc2\xa0 When the President took office there were 180,000 military boots on the ground -- American military boots on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that number now is less than 15,000.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are some steps the Commander-in-Chief can take on his own.\xc2\xa0 There are other policies that require some legislative action, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve noted one of them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the leaders of France and Germany are headed to Kyiv, if they\xe2\x80\x99re not already there, with a new peace proposal that seems to be getting some positive initial reaction from Russia.\xc2\xa0 They also seem to be not too keen on the U.S. considering sending lethal assistance to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering what the U.S. feels about this new peace proposal from France and Germany, particularly in the context of Merkel coming here next week and these discussions about whether to send lethal aid.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I\'m also interested, if you have anything on that magical piece of paper that you would like to share with us, feel free to do that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s purely administrative.\xc2\xa0 It\'s nothing that -- (laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you just resign?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That better not be the case.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet me say a couple things about this.\xc2\xa0 The first is that the United States has been saying for some time that it\'s a diplomatic negotiation that is required to bring this conflict in Ukraine to an end, that this is not something that\'s going to be solved or resolved militarily, but rather through diplomatic negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly are encouraging and supportive of ongoing efforts to try to find a peaceful diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Ukraine.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOne concern that we have, however, is that previous diplomatic efforts have resulted in agreements that the Russians and the separatists that they back in eastern Ukraine didn\xe2\x80\x99t live up to.\xc2\xa0 There were commitments made in the context of the Minsk Agreement that was signed, I believe, back in September.\xc2\xa0 Those commitments included things like withdrawing all troops and weapons from eastern Ukraine; and establishing effective international monitoring of the international border between Ukraine and Russia; returning control of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s side of the border to the central government in Kyiv; freeing all of the hostages and working toward a peaceful resolution of the conflict.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat is -- let me do the math here -- I think that is five or six different specific provisions of the Minsk Agreement, and the separatists haven\'t lived up to one of them -- hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lived up to a single one of them.\xc2\xa0 And that is an indication that we need serious engagement from the Russians and the separatists, the likes of which we\'ve not seen before.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re going to continue to be supportive of ongoing efforts to try to find a diplomatic resolution to this situation while, at the same time, we\'re going to continue to urge the Russians and the separatists that they back to live up to the diplomatic agreements that they make.\xc2\xa0 And that ultimately is the way that the situation can and should be resolved.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTo that end, there is -- I think just sort of looking at the public schedule of members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team, you can tell that there is deepened engagement on this issue right now.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSecretary Kerry is in Kyiv right now as we speak.\xc2\xa0 He had a news conference a little earlier this morning Eastern Time with I believe it was with the Ukrainian President while he was over there.\xc2\xa0 I know that he\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with a number of senior officials.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend -- you know that the Vice President is currently on his way to Europe.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll be participating in the Munich Security Conference, as he\xe2\x80\x99s done in years past.\xc2\xa0 And while he\xe2\x80\x99s there he\xe2\x80\x99s going to meet with the Ukrainian President Poroshenko, as well as other European leaders.\xc2\xa0 And then, of course, on Monday, as we\'ve previously announced, the President is planning to convene a meeting with German Chancellor Merkel while she\xe2\x80\x99s here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 Their entire meeting will not be devoted to just the situation in Ukraine, but that certainly will be a substantial part of the discussion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 So focusing on that meeting then with Chancellor Merkel, you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked frequently about the importance of staying in lockstep with our European partners on this issue, especially when it comes to the pace at which we move forward with sanctions.\xc2\xa0 But the Europeans really seem like they really don\'t think that\'s a good idea for us to be putting more weapons in this conflict.\xc2\xa0 So if Chancellor Merkel comes here next week and says to the President what she said publicly, which is that Germany is not going to be sending lethal assistance and they don\'t think that it\'s a good idea, will the President still have that option on the table and consider sending it regardless?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is going to make a decision that he believes is in the broader national security interests of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And part of that is understanding what sort of impact the decisions that we make have on our allies.\xc2\xa0 And so the President is, of course, going to reserve the right to make the decision about our broader strategy from the standpoint of the United States vis-\xc3\xa0-vis Ukraine.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President, though, has indicated the desire to work closely with our allies, and certainly the success that we\'ve enjoyed so far in instituting an economic sanctions regime against Russia has depended on very close coordination with our allies in Europe.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0 The sanctions regime that we put in place, working in lockstep with our European allies, has required close consultation and cooperation with Europe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe reason for that is the economic ties between Russia and Europe are much deeper than the bilateral economic ties between the United States and Russia.\xc2\xa0 So being able to act in coordinated fashion has been the key to the success of that sanctions regime.\xc2\xa0 But certainly the President takes very seriously the views of our allies and is going to consult very closely as we evaluate any needed strategic changes ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJulia.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House beat.\xc2\xa0 I understand that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be joining us more regularly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Among the many departure announcements yesterday, we learned that FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg is stepping down.\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us about how you anticipate a confirmation of someone to take her place, especially considering Republicans would have to confirm someone who has been somewhat critical of the FDA if it wanted the whittle down on its regulatory authority?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julia, I can tell you that the President certainly appreciates Dr. Hamburg\xe2\x80\x99s tireless service over the last six years.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of issues that she\xe2\x80\x99s grappled with over at the FDA, and the professionalism that she\xe2\x80\x99s brought to that job has made her very effective as the leader of that agency.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s leaving a legacy of advancements that include biomedical innovation, modernizing the food safety system, and reducing death and disease caused by tobacco.\xc2\xa0 So she\xe2\x80\x99s got quite a legacy that she\xe2\x80\x99s leaving.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to her successor, I don\'t have any announcements on that at this point.\xc2\xa0 Certainly the President will be focusing on somebody that has the kind of impeccable medical and scientific credentials that they can bring to the job.\xc2\xa0 And when we have more to announce on this we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say one other thing -- that when the President does make an announcement, we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that that individual will -- that he will appoint the kind of individual that will merit strong bipartisan support in the Senate.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s been a major hack into insurer Anthem.\xc2\xa0 There were about 80 million accounts that had their information stolen.\xc2\xa0 How big of a deal is this?\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed?\xc2\xa0 And, also, since Anthem has a large federal employer population, I was wondering if anyone at the White House happened to be affected.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, I can tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly aware of these reports.\xc2\xa0 The FBI is leading an investigation to determine what exactly happened and to try to determine the scope of the impact.\xc2\xa0 So for specific questions about this incident, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the FBI.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information to share in terms of the individual impact or the individuals who may have been affected by this incident.\xc2\xa0 It does serve as a useful opportunity, though, for me to remind you of two things.\xc2\xa0 The first is we did spend some time a couple of weeks ago talking about the specific legislative proposals that have been put forward by this administration to try to address cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 And there are some important steps that are included in that legislation that would improve the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s response to situations like this and would improve coordination between law enforcement authorities, private industry, and consumer advocates to ensure that all the necessary steps are taken to both harden the defenses of organizations that are directly affected; to communicate information about the intrusion to make sure that similar tactics that may prove damaging in one scenario can\xe2\x80\x99t be used against other companies; and then we also want to make sure that we have a codified system for making sure that consumers are properly informed and educated about what steps they can take to safeguard their data.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of important work that needs to be done around this in the United States Congress.\xc2\xa0 The good news is this is not an ideological kind of issue and that there are Republicans who have indicated that they also understand just how serious this is.\xc2\xa0 So we are hopeful that by working with Congress we can make some important progress and take some steps that would actually safeguard the American people and their data.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe last thing is just a reminder that there will be quite an extensive discussion of these kinds of issues at the cyber summit that the administration is hosting out at Stanford University next week.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to the opportunity to convene meetings with leaders in private industry, leaders in the tech sector who have some expertise around some of these issues, government officials not just at the federal level but also at the state and local who all have equities in dealing with this rather complicated policy issue.\xc2\xa0 But the consequences for us dealing with this policy issue are significant, and certainly the President and his administration take it very seriously and are hopeful that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see others on the other side of the aisle also take it seriously as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMargaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 The President met with a group of Muslim leaders yesterday, but the White House hasn\xe2\x80\x99t released a sort of listing of them and I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you can talk us through why.\xc2\xa0 Was it considered a private meeting or are there concerns of -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list of those who attended, but let me see if I can try to extract some more information from them for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be great, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to clean up on a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 On AUMF, you were saying that you could expect the language reasonably soon -- do you think --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Relatively soon, I think is what I said.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you rule out like the end of this week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You mean as in tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily rule it out.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\'s going to be tomorrow, but these kinds of plans often have a way of changing, so, I think relatively soon is probably the best guidance I can offer at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And if I can do \xe2\x80\x9cBibigate\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cspeechgate,\xe2\x80\x9d or whatever you want to call it.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a two-parter.\xc2\xa0 Nancy Pelosi is still talking about whether she may boycott that speech.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just wondering if you could give us some more clarity about the White House and the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking on whether this is an appropriate individual decision for Democrats, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re offering any guidance when people call to ask.\xc2\xa0 And also what does he think about the fact that this has caused so much controversy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned yesterday, the President does believe it is up to individual members of Congress to make their own decision about whether or not to attend.\xc2\xa0 The concern that we have exhibited here is not just about the departure from protocol in terms of extending the invitation, but also the President believes very firmly in continuing an important tradition, which is to ensure that the strong relationship between the\xc2\xa0 United States and Israel is protected from partisan politics, that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow the relationship between our two countries to be reduced to a relationship between two political parties.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that is something that the President is concerned about. And, frankly, the seriousness with which the President considers this principle is what\xe2\x80\x99s driving the decision to not meet with the Prime Minster when he\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xc2\xa0 As you know, when the Prime Minster is in the United States during the first week in March, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be up for an election that\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled for just two weeks later back in Israel.\xc2\xa0 And the President is conscious of ensuring that we don\xe2\x80\x99t leave anybody with the appearance, or even with the appearance, of somehow interfering in that election by weighing in on one side or the other.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President takes these issues very seriously, but ultimately, those kinds of decisions about whether or not to attend and what sort of impact that might have on an ongoing election in another country or what kind of signal that might send is a decision that every individual member of Congress needs to make for themselves.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But has he gone as far as to say that he really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that the Prime Minster should go through with the speech?\xc2\xa0 Or have you guys drawn a line before saying --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have not said that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not saying that now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You could say that now if you want.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I could say that now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clean up on Josh\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 He knows the Pope is coming and so he probably is not shocked that the Pope is addressing Congress and he\xe2\x80\x99s probably fine with it.\xc2\xa0 But was there any coordination this time around?\xc2\xa0 Is there any effort by the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office to make that sort of good-faith gesture to say, look, no hard feelings, let\xe2\x80\x99s coordinate stuff?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to all of the conversations that may or may not have occurred in advance of that specific invitation, but certainly the President and the team here was aware of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s intent to travel to the United States and intent to spend some time in Washington D.C.\xc2\xa0 I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s still some details of that schedule that are getting locked down so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of any announcements that may be planned by the Vatican.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAll right.\xc2\xa0 Justin.\xc2\xa0 I understand you announced a new job today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Moving up a couple rows.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, congratulations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about Jordan first.\xc2\xa0 Nancy Pelosi today backed the Senate Armed Service Committee who -- the entire committee sent a letter to the White House yesterday urging more aid for Jordan.\xc2\xa0 I know you were asked about this yesterday, and you said it would depend on a specific request from Jordan.\xc2\xa0 And so I\'m wondering if you might have any more details on if that sort of request has been made and, if so, if the administration is working to fulfill it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I know, Justin, is that the United States has a very deep security relationship with Jordan, and that involves providing hundreds of millions of dollars a year in security assistance to the Jordanians.\xc2\xa0 And much of that security assistance is in the form of military equipment, and some of which has been used to contribute to the broader international campaign against ISIL.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI know that there had been some interest expressed by the Jordanians and others to try to expedite assistance that was already in the pipeline.\xc2\xa0 This is not an uncommon request from other countries with whom we have security relationships, and so that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re always working on.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I can tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99re always looking for ways that we can deepen our relationship with Jordan.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you that while the King was here on Tuesday, there was the signing of a memorandum -- a memorandum of understanding between the United States and Jordan that would extend our security situation -- or our security relationship into 2017, and would guarantee the provision of security assistance on the order of about $400 *billion million a year.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s a substantial commitment of military assistance and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that is not just a short-term relationship but one that is a long-running one and one that we acted to extend while the King was visiting earlier this week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to ask about the status of DHS funding.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the Senate has been voting and blocking the House bill.\xc2\xa0 Mitch McConnell said that he expects to kind of work out a deal in the next couple weeks.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, has it gotten to the point where you guys are having conversations with Republicans about possible sweeteners to add to that deal that might make it more palatable to Republicans to get it through both the House and the Senate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specific conversations like that.\xc2\xa0 The Congress has a responsibility to pass funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 And as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say before, it\xe2\x80\x99s not really -- it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to imagine a scenario in which there\xe2\x80\x99s a good time for us to muck around with funding for the Department of Homeland Security, but now seems like a particularly bad time to do so.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that Republicans will embrace the responsibility that they have, now that they\xe2\x80\x99re in control of the United States Congress, to use the power of the purse that our founders gave to them to make sure that our Department of Homeland Security is fully and properly funded.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have a scenario where we have men and women in uniform, our federal law enforcement officers, people who are responsible for protecting our ports, people who are responsible for protecting our transportation system and particularly our air transportation system -- those individuals shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to go without a paycheck.\xc2\xa0 And I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine why anybody would think that would be anything but bad for our national security.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful -- Republicans have a couple of weeks to figure this out, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they will.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just remind you -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t really like to stand up here and say I told you so -- but we did spend some time last fall where I noted that I felt like it was going to put Republicans in a really difficult situation to threaten funding for the Department of Homeland Security merely over a political disagreement.\xc2\xa0 But, unfortunately, that seems to be the situation in which Republicans find themselves.\xc2\xa0 And I think they\xe2\x80\x99re finding that certainly the vast majority of Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t find this to be a particularly persuasive argument that they\xe2\x80\x99re making.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they\xe2\x80\x99re just going to put politics aside, focus on their core responsibility to actually fund the United States government, particularly critically important functions like Homeland Security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a quick question on the meeting with the Muslim leaders.\xc2\xa0 Why was the decision made not to allow any press coverage of that meeting?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, the President has many meetings at the White House and certainly not all of them include some press coverage.\xc2\xa0 So we did, however, want to make sure that we were as transparent as we could be about the fact that the meeting was taking place.\xc2\xa0 And I understand that there was a blog post put up to sort of characterize the discussion that occurred.\xc2\xa0 But there was no pool spray plan.\xc2\xa0 There was a pool spray earlier in the day that all of you had with the President when he was meeting with some -- I believe it was DREAM Act folks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a question on Saudi Arabia in light of these allegations that have been made by Zacarias Moussaoui that the Saudis helped finance and had contact with the 9/11 hijackers.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House position on that section of the 9/11 report that has been classified that may or may not shed some light on this issue?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, Jon, I can tell you that the administration, in response to a specific congressional request, last year asked the intelligence community to conduct a classification review of that material.\xc2\xa0 And we did so in keeping with the standard procedure for determining whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate to release classified material.\xc2\xa0 And all I can tell you is that that process is ongoing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a sense of when that process will be finished?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timeline for when that classification process will be completed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what do you make of these allegations?\xc2\xa0 Obviously they come from a convicted terrorist, but does the White House believe there\xe2\x80\x99s anything to this suggestion that the Saudis may have been more involved?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on those assertions from somebody who, as you point out, has been convicted of very serious terrorism charges.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to reiterate something that we have said many times and I think that was on display when the President stopped in Riyadh on his way back from India last week, and specifically, that is that the United States and Saudi Arabia maintain a strong counterterrorism relationship as a key element of our broad and strategic partnership.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then a question on the departures.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Pfeiffer, Palmieri, Podesta -- a lot of people whose names begin with \xe2\x80\x9cP\xe2\x80\x9d I guess.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re readily identifiable by one name.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Which makes them rock stars.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re doing it alphabetically.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a significant percentage of the President\xe2\x80\x99s senior advisory team here at the White House leaving at roughly the same time.\xc2\xa0 Is there a sense that people are kind of running for the exits for the rest of this presidency?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the President going to do about replacing them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, I can tell you that the three individuals that you named are people who have made substantial contribution to the President\xe2\x80\x99s success here in his presidency.\xc2\xa0 And they have made contributions that are difficult to measure on a whole range of issues.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the fact that these are people who have served the President and the American people exceedingly well while they\xe2\x80\x99ve been here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOne of their principal accomplishments was to build a team here at the White House that has been very successful in ensuring the President\xe2\x80\x99s success in executing on the kinds of strategic decisions that have been really good for the country.\xc2\xa0 And even just in the last several months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President take the kinds of steps -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s securing an historic agreement with China, to announcing executive actions on bringing greater accountability to our immigration system -- there are a whole host of things, particularly in the last few months, where the President has demonstrated and built up some momentum.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the team that those individuals have built are largely responsible for that success.\xc2\xa0 And I think when you get a chance to speak to all of them, each of them will tell you that this team is poised to continue that success and to build on that momentum.\xc2\xa0 And I think they would also say -- and from covering White Houses in the past, I think you have a good sense of this, too -- is that particularly near the end of the last couple of years of a presidency, that an infusion of fresh legs and different perspective can be a really useful thing.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President, and Denis will take very seriously the responsibility that they have to replenish the leadership, to work with a team that\xe2\x80\x99s already in place to continue the President\xe2\x80\x99s success.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically on Pfeiffer and Podesta, will those two jobs be -- I mean, obviously you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a new communications director coming in.\xc2\xa0 But will those two jobs be replaced with similar job responsibilities?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Podesta will be replaced by Brian Deese, who has been the Deputy Director at OMB.\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99d be the first to admit that it\'s impossible to replace John Podesta, but certainly Brian will be stepping in to fill his shoes and take on many of the responsibilities that John filled while he was here. And I think the President has spoken to the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s really excited about Brian taking on these kinds of responsibilities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to replacing Pfeiffer, and the impossibility of doing precisely that, there is still an on-going discussion about how exactly to do so much of the work that Dan did around here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMichelle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Several people now, family members of 9/11 victims have said that President Obama told them personally that he wanted to release these classified pages, that he would do that soon.\xc2\xa0 So we know that it\'s going through this lengthy process, but does he still, in principle, agree with declassifying those pages?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, I\'m not going to read out any private conversations that the President may have had, but I will tell you that in response to these kinds of requests, the administration has moved forward with asking the intelligence community to conduct a classification review of this material.\xc2\xa0 And that is standard operating procedure when the government is considering releasing classified material.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe certainly want to make sure that by releasing material that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to create additional problems or vulnerabilities to our national security system.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to reveal sources and methods, for example.\xc2\xa0 So that review is ongoing and that is part of, like I said, the standard operating procedure for when the administration is considering a request to release classified information.\xc2\xa0 And that review is ongoing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But by saying that, you\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that moving forward is an indication of his support of declassifying it -- or are you?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\'m saying is that there is a process in place for evaluating whether or not it is possible to release this information without harming national security.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m confident that the President would -- while being a stalwart advocate for transparency, would not be in support of releasing information that could harm our national security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But since several people have said sort of the same thing about what the President told them, you can\xe2\x80\x99t say whether he did, indeed, at the time, say those things to those family members?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to read out any private conversations the President may have had.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on Ukraine, several months ago whenever lethal aid was asked about, the administration would always say, well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a serious concern about not fighting a proxy war or escalating the situation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s a serious concern, to the point that at the time lethal aid would not be considered.\xc2\xa0 Well, now that it is being considered, has something trumped the risk that is still the same of either escalation or the proxy war?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, Michelle, and I think what I can say is that it\'s indicative of the kind of commitment that this administration has to regularly reevaluate and reassess our strategy for accomplishing something.\xc2\xa0 And we do that in a variety of areas, and this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly focusing on -- is making sure at every turn that we have a strategy that optimizes our likelihood of success.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd what we have seen over the last several months when it comes to Ukraine is the success of a strategy of putting intense pressure on the Putin regime by putting in place sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that those sanctions have had a pretty devastating impact on the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat, of course, has been coupled with falling energy prices and other things, and that success would not have been possible without the close cooperation and coordination with our allies and friends in Europe.\xc2\xa0 But it has not resulted in the kind of decision-making that we would like to see from the Putin regime that would cause them to actually live up to the kind of commitments they made in the context of the Minsk negotiations.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s part of why we\xe2\x80\x99re considering a wide range of things as it relates to our strategy.\xc2\xa0 And certainly one of the things that we believe is necessary based on this constant reassessment is that there is additional economic assistance that can be provided.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the administration early this year put forward a specific request to the Congress to pass legislation that would offer up an additional $1 billion in loan guarantees to the Ukrainians, to offer up that financial assistance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Ukrainian economy has also been destabilized by the activities of the Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. So this is a multifaceted strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99re considering very carefully here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the risk of things escalating because of lethal aid still exists, in the administration\xe2\x80\x99s opinion?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the concern that we have is two things. One is the President -- and the President mentioned this is the news conference that he hosted with Prime Minister Modi in India -- where the President noted that we were going to -- that this conflict was not going to rise to the level of a military confrontation between the United States and Russia.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very clear about that.\xc2\xa0 So there are things that we are going to continue to avoid.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut one of the concerns that we have about providing military assistance is it does contain the possibility of actually expanding bloodshed, and that\xe2\x80\x99s actually what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to avoid.\xc2\xa0 The whole reason that we are trying to encourage both sides to sit down and hammer out a diplomatic agreement is to end the bloodshed and end the escalating conflict in that country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the fact is, we have seen the Ukrainian government live up to a lot of those agreements and at least try to implement them.\xc2\xa0 But those efforts have been entirely undermined by Russian-backed separatists with the full support of Russia, completely ignoring those commitments that they made just a few months earlier.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to ask you a question about Boko Haram.\xc2\xa0 What is the relationship between the United States government and the Nigerian government at this time, particularly as it relates to the fighting against terror in Nigeria with Boko Haram?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I can tell you that there continues to be an interdisciplinary team in Abuja right now.\xc2\xa0 These are government officials with a wide variety of skills and expertise, some of them in the military, who are offering counterterrorism assistance to the Nigerian government.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are supportive of the efforts taken by the Nigerian government to try to combat this terror threat that they face in their country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, we have in the past, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it again, expressed concerns about some of the things that the Nigerian government has done in the name of counterterrorism that has trampled some of the basic universal human rights that we\xe2\x80\x99re very protective of in this country.\xc2\xa0 And we have urged them, as they take these steps to address terrorism in their own country, to be respectful of the human rights of their people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut certainly we have an ongoing security and counterterrorism cooperation relationship with the Nigerian government, and that relationship continues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that said, that statement that you just made, what is the level of expectation from this White House as it relates to the upcoming elections in Nigeria, as well as finding any of the missing girls?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly we want to assist the Nigerian government in carrying out -- or supporting them as they carry out an election that is free, and fair, and transparent, and ends with a result that reflects the genuine will of the Nigerian people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean a change in government, a change in leadership?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a decision for the Nigerian people to make, and we certainly want to support the Nigerian government as they hold an election that is open, and transparent, and actually has a result that reflects the will of the Nigerian people.\xc2\xa0 Our efforts to support the Nigerian-led operation to try to safely recover the Chibok girls continues.\xc2\xa0 This is very difficult work, and our concern about this continues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask one last question on this.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of concern and a lot of conversation about ISIS, a lot of new stories about ISIS.\xc2\xa0 But how does this White House look at ISIS versus Boko Haram?\xc2\xa0 ISIS is more of a threat than Boko Haram?\xc2\xa0 Or are they both, kind of, on the same equal footing as terror items affecting the world?\xc2\xa0 How are they viewed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I can send you to somebody at the National Security Council that may be will be able to give you a more thoughtful answer, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a crack at it.\xc2\xa0 The way that the President views these kinds of things is through the prism of what\xe2\x80\x99s best for American national security and our security interests around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And that is how the President determines the appropriate level of U.S. involvement in these efforts, and it is how we evaluate the kinds of steps that we need to take -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s direct military intervention or otherwise -- to try to help these countries counter these extremists that are operating in their country.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I guess the point is, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to compare them because we consider each of them individually on a case-by-case basis and evaluate them by looking at what impact they have on American national security.\xc2\xa0 But I could put you in touch with somebody in the National Security Council who may be able to give you a more detailed assessment than that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regarding the Anthem data breach, the federal government spent $26 billion to help the health industry convert to electronic records, and the deadline was last month.\xc2\xa0 And yet the FBI says that the cybersecurity there is -- the standards are very lax -- their words.\xc2\xa0 So after all that investment, why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the health care system\xe2\x80\x99s security more robust?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill, I can tell you that that conversion to electronic health records has saved money and saved lives, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the principal reason for doing that.\xc2\xa0 And so this issue of cybersecurity is something that industries all across the country and around the world are grappling with right now.\xc2\xa0 This is a persistent problem in the financial industry.\xc2\xa0 We know that the entertainment industry, late last year, had a rather high-profile issue that they were dealing with, and it is one that affects the health care industry as well.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important for us to take a comprehensive approach to dealing with this challenge, and that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the goals of the legislation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward and hope that Congress will pass.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the kind of thing that will be under discussion at the cybersecurity summit that the President is convening next week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But those goals are not anywhere near translation to legislation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have put forward specific legislative language and sent it to Congress.\xc2\xa0 Now, I recognize that Republicans in Congress may have their own ideas about how they want to change that legislation, but certainly the President has been very forward-leaning and aggressive in making exactly clear exactly what he believes this country can do to strengthen our cybersecurity defenses and better react when a cyber breach has been detected.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration believe that President Putin has Asperger\xe2\x80\x99s syndrome?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I saw that report today.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on that Pentagon report.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, this was a study done by an outside consultant for the Pentagon, which had some credibility, apparently.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s un-credible, necessarily, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a personal reaction to it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then finally, Kerry said in Kyiv that the President would decide soon on lethal assistance for Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csoon\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update in terms of timing for any sort of decision.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no decision that\xe2\x80\x99s been made at this point that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 But like I was telling Michelle, we do have a posture of continually reevaluating and reassessing the success and progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made based on the strategies that are currently implemented.\xc2\xa0 And part of that evaluation process includes raising the question about whether or not we need to make some changes to our strategy to make it more effective.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing on a continual basis.\xc2\xa0 But if there are any high-profile announcements to make around that strategy, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEd.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on Pope Francis\xe2\x80\x99s speech to Congress, will Vice President Biden attend or will he be out of the country?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The speech from the Pope I know is slated for September, and the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for that period of time has not been set.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99d anticipate he\xe2\x80\x99d be there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that he would be there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why can\xe2\x80\x99t you say the same about Prime Minister Netanyahu?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for the first week of March is also not yet set.\xc2\xa0 But as I mentioned earlier -- I guess it was yesterday -- I noted that the Vice President takes very seriously the ceremonial responsibilities that he has before the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s everything from participating in swearing-in ceremonies to participating in the convening of joint sessions of Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, there has been at least one previous occasion during his tenure as the Vice President where he\xe2\x80\x99s been unable to attend a joint session of Congress because he was traveling overseas.\xc2\xa0 So when we have more details about the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for the first week of March, we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly let you know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on the two questions you got about the meeting with Muslim leaders yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We were specifically told that you would not release it yesterday because there were private citizens who came in.\xc2\xa0 Now, as you yourself noted, the President met with private citizens who were DREAMers.\xc2\xa0 They\'re pretty young.\xc2\xa0 And you brought in TV cameras.\xc2\xa0 We didn\'t get all their names, but they\'re private citizens, as well.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sort of curious, is that under -- you suggested at the beginning that you might get the names.\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can do that for you.\xc2\xa0 One thing we do know is that the names will be included in the WAVES records that are released.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re are on that regular process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe months down the road, but --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 So they will, at least at some point, be released.\xc2\xa0 Let me see if I can get them released sooner.\xc2\xa0 I know that at least a couple of the individuals who participated in that meeting have spoken publicly about their participation in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 So you know at least --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But doesn\'t that make it -- just put the list out there, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s what I had told you I\xe2\x80\x99d do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, just last night the White House told us they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put it out.\xc2\xa0 I just want to put that on the record.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, two quick things.\xc2\xa0 Jordan.\xc2\xa0 When Justin asked you, I still didn\'t hear a direct answer, like yesterday.\xc2\xa0 So will the President help approve more weapons to Jordan?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed, we have this continuing security relationship with Jordan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a crisis right now.\xc2\xa0 Bombs are being dropped in Syria, right?\xc2\xa0 I understand the long term.\xc2\xa0 But the King went back there and said, there\xe2\x80\x99s a crisis, we\'re going in.\xc2\xa0 So will the President approve it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, the United States remains committed to ensuring that we stand shoulder to shoulder with our partners in Jordan at this very serious time.\xc2\xa0 And it is clear that because of the terrible violence that was released via video yesterday, that that nation is going through a very difficult time.\xc2\xa0 And they can count on their partners in the United States to stand with them at that very difficult time.\xc2\xa0 And if that means ensuring that they are getting the security assistance that they were promised, they can count on the President of the United States being a strong advocate for making sure that they get that assistance that they need.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to put a finer point on what Justin said about Nancy Pelosi, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe the administration should move quickly to give more capacity to Jordanians.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 This is not the President\xe2\x80\x99s critics on the Hill saying, you\'re slow of foot.\xc2\xa0 You have the top Democratic leader saying, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, what I can tell you is that the President will continue -- as he has in the past -- to be a strong advocate for making sure that the United States is doing all that we can and all that we should, and all that we promised we would do, to show our support for the Jordanian people, including providing needed security assistance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Susan Rice tomorrow giving this speech about laying out the sort of official national security strategy.\xc2\xa0 Last time this was done was in 2010.\xc2\xa0 And the news reports at the time and the actual speech we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at said that the point of it was the administration\xe2\x80\x99s strategy basically was that the U.S. needed to focus on a broader agenda and not just organize national security policy around counterterrorism, and that you had to focus on managing threats, use less American power, and not just focus on counterterror.\xc2\xa0 In retrospect, was that na\xc3\xafve five years later?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that -- not at all.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think one clear piece of evidence to indicate that that strategy has enjoyed some success is the success that the administration has had and that the President has had in building and leading a coalition of more than 60 nations to take the fight to ISIL and degrade and ultimately destroy them.\xc2\xa0 That it\xe2\x80\x99s not exclusively American planes that are dropping bombs on Syria and Iraq; that we welcome the participation of our allies in Europe, but also some of our allies actually in the region who are working side by side with American military pilots to strike targets on the ground.\xc2\xa0 That we are working closely with Saudi Arabia, for example, to get to work on a program that would train and equip moderate Syrian opposition fighters so that they can take the fight on the ground to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is an indication of how we can use American influence to protect American national security interests.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, of course -- and I had this conversation with Michelle a little bit yesterday -- of course, the United States military is taking a leadership role, and they are shouldering most of this burden.\xc2\xa0 But by making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re including our partners that also have significant military capabilities, we can reduce the strain and burden on the American military and on the American taxpayers, by the way, but also do that in a way that gets them more bought-in on this fight so the United States is not standing alone countering this threat, but that we actually have countries all around the world that are contributing to this effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On the AUMF -- did you want to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Schultz is prolific today.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Chris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the AUMF, you said you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t roll it out tomorrow; at least, you said it would be relatively soon.\xc2\xa0 John Boehner told us this morning that he thought that they would get it within a couple of days.\xc2\xa0 Is the language done?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the language is still the subject of ongoing discussions between administration officials and Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that the goal here was to ensure that we submitted legislation that could attract bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And to that end, what we have done is tried to consult with Democrats and Republicans in advance of submitting that language so that we could have some reasonable degree of confidence that the legislation would get exactly that kind of support, both from Democrats and Republicans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not settled?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that we have made substantial progress since the President convened that meeting a couple of weeks ago where this was discussed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other thing that John Boehner said today was that it was going to be incumbent upon the President to make the case about why we have to fight this fight.\xc2\xa0 And he suggested that actually passing the authorization -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to quote him -- \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not going to be an easy lift.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the White House anticipate that this is going to be tough to pass?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would anticipate that when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an issue as weighty as an authorization for the Commander-in-Chief to use military force, that these are very serious issues and that people have some very strongly held views about it.\xc2\xa0 And so I would anticipate that there will be a very robust debate.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, Chris, things that aren\xe2\x80\x99t that serious have a hard time getting through the United States Congress these days.\xc2\xa0 So when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about something as weighty as an authorization to use military force, I would anticipate that it will require substantial effort from certainly the leaders in both parties in both chambers of Congress, but I think as is evident from the robust consultation that has taken place between the administration and Capitol Hill, that the administration is also committed to dedicating some resources to the passage of this new AUMF.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the reason for that -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s important that people don\xe2\x80\x99t lose sight of this -- the President believes it sends a very powerful signal to the American people, to our allies, and even to our enemies, that the United States of America is united behind this strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL; that across branches of government and even across political parties, even in this divided time in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s political history at least, that Democrats and Republicans are committed to this very important task.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect, even though there will be some robust debate, it will get done?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make a prediction like that.\xc2\xa0 What I will make a prediction is that we are going to work very closely with Democrats and Republicans to try to move this through both Houses of Congress.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll let people who are much more astute analysts of congressional action give you an approximation of the likelihood of the passage of a new AUMF.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I just want to ask you about the visit by Benjamin Netanyahu and the fact that the President is not going to be meeting with him.\xc2\xa0 It certainly looks like he\xe2\x80\x99s likely to win reelection, even before this happens, so we\xe2\x80\x99re sort of anticipating.\xc2\xa0 How problematic is this for the President\xe2\x80\x99s, shall we say, less than cozy relationship with Mr. Netanyahu?\xc2\xa0 And has this been damaging overall to U.S.-Israeli relations?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just state at the beginning that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about the outcome of the election because, again, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want even my uninformed speculation about Israeli politics to be construed as interfering in that election in any way.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what I can talk about is the relationship between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 And I think what is clear from the public statements of both men is that the counterterrorism and security relationship between our two countries has never been stronger.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Prime Minister himself who said that the level of security cooperation between the United States and Israel is unprecedented.\xc2\xa0 And that reflects a commitment from people on both sides of this relationship working together to pursue the national security interests of both their countries.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of the United States of America for the United States to have a strong security relationship and security partnership with Israel, our closest ally in the Middle East.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s also important to the people of Israel that they have a strong and functioning security relationship with the United States.\xc2\xa0 Just last year, when innocent Israeli citizens were in the line of fire from extremists in Gaza who were firing rockets across the border, the United States acted to ramp up our assistance to the Israelis and provide additional funding for the Iron Dome program so that that program could be resupplied.\xc2\xa0 And the Iron Dome program is essentially the program that\xe2\x80\x99s used to shoot down rockets that are destined for Israeli population centers.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there is an important relationship between our two countries, and both Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama have succeeded in ensuring that that strong relationship continues to serve very well the populations of both our countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo what Mr. Schultz has passed me is that apparently, Justin, in answering your question, I misspoke.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually remember even misspeaking, but apparently I did.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So I noted that the United States and Jordan earlier this week, just two days ago, had signed a memorandum of understanding between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 Apparently, I said \xe2\x80\x9cbillion\xe2\x80\x9d when I meant to say \xe2\x80\x9cmillion.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That the memorandum of understanding relates to $300 to $400 million a year in security assistance through 2017.\xc2\xa0 Apparently I said \xe2\x80\x9cbillion\xe2\x80\x9d and I regret the error.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJ.C.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference, really?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Back to the Arabian Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 Does the situation in Yemen, which we haven\xe2\x80\x99t really discussed in about a week, raise the threat level to the United States, and does it raise the threat level in the region?\xc2\xa0 And can you update us on the situation there, vis-\xc3\xa0-vis the U.S. presence?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I assume you\xe2\x80\x99re asking this question because of some of the reports overnight about an operation that may have taken out a senior AQAP leader and some other fighters there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Among other things.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I know that the reporting speculated on U.S. involvement.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- as in previous cases where these kinds of things have been reported, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to be in a position to comment on them.\xc2\xa0 But what I can say is that the President has been very clear about the need to continue our counterterrorism operations in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 Those counterterrorism operations continue.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI know there\xe2\x80\x99s also been some reporting that speculated that the coordination between the United States and Yemen had been stopped in light of the political instability there.\xc2\xa0 Those reports were inaccurate.\xc2\xa0 The United States and Yemeni national security officials continue to coordinate on these efforts.\xc2\xa0 And they do reflect that AQAP continues to be one of the, if not the most, dangerous al Qaeda affiliate out there; that they have substantial capabilities when it comes to bomb-making and they have carried out dangerous attempts to try to strike the U.S. homeland.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so we continue to be very cognizant of that threat, and we continue to work vigilantly with the Yemeni national security officials to counter that threat.\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to specific reports on specific operations, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to comment on them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any more information on the possibility that they could be, the Houthi, in fact, could be taking direction from Tehran?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said about this in the past, J.C., I believe still applies, which is that we are concerned about some of the ties between that movement and the Iranian regime, but we have not -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any clear evidence -- at least the last time that I talked about this with our national security team -- that Iran is exercising any sort of command-and-control authority at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAlexis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that lethal aid to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Is President Obama expected to be influenced by Chancellor Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s stated position on this, since he will be seeing her next week and the Vice President will be seeing her?\xc2\xa0 Is the position of the German Chancellor on this question of major influence to the President\xe2\x80\x99s own decision about whether the U.S. should be helpful?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Alexis, I don\'t want to read out any sort of private conversations between the President and Chancellor Merkel.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that on our flight back from Saudi Arabia, I believe, that the President did have the opportunity to speak on the telephone with Chancellor Merkel.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that was on the flight from India to Saudi Arabia, or from Saudi Arabia on the way back.\xc2\xa0 But last week, the President, on Air Force One, did have the opportunity to visit with her.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President speaks with the Chancellor quite frequently on a wide range of issues, not just the conflict in Ukraine, but on the economic situation of the EU, particularly as it relates to Greece.\xc2\xa0 There are a whole host of other areas where the United States and Germany cooperate very closely.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think that is an indication to you that the personal opinion of the German Chancellor matters a great deal to the President and he values her advice and her insight.\xc2\xa0 He certainly wants to understand her perspective when it comes to the impact that U.S. decisions could have on Germany and on the people of Germany.\xc2\xa0 And that is why it\'s so critical that they have the kind of relationship where they can speak frankly with one another and where they can faithfully represent the views of their people and advocate for the best interests of their two countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so often what they find when they talk is that the national security interests of the people of Germany are very clearly aligned with the national security interests of the United States and the people of this country.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what makes us such close allies, and that\'s why the President is looking forward to her visiting the White House next week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether the President\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of this question might conclude in time for him to join the Chancellor in talking about this in Washington next week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any previews to offer of their discussions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say what kind of access the media will have to the two of them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'re working through it.\xc2\xa0 I believe that we are looking at doing a news conference that day.\xc2\xa0 So maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to ask her about the discussion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other question about the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the Muslim leaders -- I don\'t know what you want to call them.\xc2\xa0 Can you describe how the President wants to use that conversation, the discussion that he had, in the context of a summit on violent extremism?\xc2\xa0 How will it help him in his thinking and to use practical mechanisms, either through that summit or follow-ons to the summit, to accomplish some of the goals he\xe2\x80\x99s already stated?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you probably saw from the readout that we did from the meeting, the conversation was rather broad. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t just focus on our ongoing counterterrorism efforts or our efforts to try to counter radicalization attempts by extremist groups.\xc2\xa0 There was an opportunity for the President to have a pretty wide-ranging discussion with them about middle-class economics, about the importance of signing up for health care if you don\'t have it before the February 15th deadline, at healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 There were a whole range of topics that they discussed, but certainly this was one of them.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd one of the benefits of convening this summit on countering violent extremism is that we can bring together leaders in law enforcement and leaders in communities across the country, including leaders in the Muslim-American community, to talk about what we can do to try to counter the radicalizing messaging from extremist organizations.\xc2\xa0 These kinds of extremist organizations, because of technology, have more opportunities than they previously did to try to get inside the minds of vulnerable young people in this country.\xc2\xa0 That\'s true in the Muslim community, but it\'s true of all young people all across this country.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so one of the things that we\'re going to do in the context of that summit is spend some time talking to law enforcement leaders and leaders in communities across the country, including the Muslim-American community, about some of the best practices that they have implemented to try to safeguard their communities.\xc2\xa0 And we want to create a scenario where we can identify these best practices and communicate them to communities all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And certainly we\'re going to value the kind of input that we get both from law enforcement but also from community leaders, both of whom have a really clear interest in protecting the people in their community.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJared.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, in addition to being a spiritual leader, the Pope is also a head of state.\xc2\xa0 Was there any departure from protocol in the invitation in September?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the authorization for the use of military force, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said \xe2\x80\x9creasonably soon\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crelatively soon\xe2\x80\x9d -- a semantic difference of which I was not aware.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Neither am I.\xc2\xa0 It was not intended.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 What is the package that the President will be delivering reasonably or relatively soon?\xc2\xa0 Because we\'ve talked about -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about a dissatisfaction with the 2001-2002 AUMFs.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve also talked about the need, the expressed need for a new document governing the Iraq and Syria actions.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s also been a repeal.\xc2\xa0 Will this be three separate documents?\xc2\xa0 I guess the thrust of the question is, will there be repeal language also submitted?\xc2\xa0 And will there be another umbrella document, another umbrella authorization to replace the 2001-2002, which the President has thus far relied on for the actions in Syria?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You asked a series of questions there, none of which seemed illegitimate to me, but the vast majority of them will be --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not a compliment, just an observation.\xc2\xa0 Many of those questions will be much easier to answer after we\'ve made an announcement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat you can expect is specific legislative language that Democrats and Republicans have worked with the administration to produce.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re hopeful that that language will earn majority support in both the House and the Senate and will attract the support of both Democrats and Republicans in building that majority.\xc2\xa0 What exactly is in the content of that language is something that I\'ll be in a position to discuss with you after that language has been released.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s one element of your question, though, that I did want to clarify, which is that at one point you described the President needing some additional authorization.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is the President does believe that the military force that he has already ordered was already authorized by the United States Congress under the 2001 AUMF.\xc2\xa0 So this is not a matter of legal necessity.\xc2\xa0 It is a matter, however, of the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to send a very clear signal to the people of this country, to our allies and to our enemies that the United States of America and our political system is united behind the strategy to degrade and destroy ISIL that the President has laid out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Despite the fact that the President, in something that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the prepared remarks but was in his statement in the State of the Union, saying we need that authorization.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And I think that was an attempt to make the case to members of Congress -- it did not reflect a change in our legal analysis, but rather him urging that the broader operation would significantly benefit from this kind of bipartisan show of unity.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just ask one other way, which is should the document that we\xe2\x80\x99ll get soon be something that\'s specifically just for ISIS in Syria and Iraq, or will it more largely address the authorizations that have governed the President\xe2\x80\x99s actions so far?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Stay tuned.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, over at the prayer breakfast today, President Obama offered a public welcome, public greeting and even public words of praise for the Dalai Lama.\xc2\xa0 What should Chinese leaders take from that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has on previous occasions had the opportunity to meet with the Dalai Lama here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The two leaders did not meet on His Holiness\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the White House this time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s respect for and appreciation of the Dalai Lama were pretty clearly articulated in the remarks that he delivered today.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not different from the sentiment that the President has previously expressed in the context of meetings that he\xe2\x80\x99s hosted with the Dalia Lama on previous visits to Washington.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs longstanding as the President\xe2\x80\x99s appreciation for the Dalai Lama is, so is the Chinese government\xe2\x80\x99s objections to those kinds of interactions.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re certainly cognizant of that impact, but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed the President\xe2\x80\x99s view.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the Dalai Lama here this week at the White House -- is that what you were saying?\xc2\xa0 But didn\'t meet with the President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I was saying he did not.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at the White House, in other words?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said the White House.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said White House but you meant Washington.\xc2\xa0 You said White House.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, sorry if I was unclear.\xc2\xa0 The President did not meet with the Dalai Lama on this visit to Washington.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And will not.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sorry about that, Mark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tByron, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on the AUMF?\xc2\xa0 What is the President going to do to get this across the finish line?\xc2\xa0 Do you have a legislative strategy mapped out?\xc2\xa0 And how much will the President personally be involved?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Byron, I would say that the key part of our legislative strategy is one that\'s being executed right now, which is to work very closely with Democrats and Republicans -- both the House and the Senate -- to put together language that we believe and that they believe can attract bipartisan support in the Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd what the President is interested in is not just passing this AUMF, but being able to demonstrate some bipartisan support for it.\xc2\xa0 And that is a critical part of our efforts because again, the goal here is to demonstrate clearly to the American people, to our allies, and to our enemies that there is strong bipartisan support for this commitment to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so the core of this strategy is coordinating on the front end to make sure that we have the kind of language that Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill feel like they can support.\xc2\xa0 And after this legislation is submitted, then we will\xc2\xa0 -- we\'re going to work closely with Democrats and Republicans to try to move this across the finish line.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a staffer at the White House who is taking responsibility for this, the negotiations with Congress?\xc2\xa0 Is there a point person?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think there is a point person that I would describe to you.\xc2\xa0 But certainly you could imagine that there are officials in the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office; obviously our legislative affairs department is keenly interested in this, as are members of the national security team.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a large number of people who are working on this effort.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think what you could also expect, Bryon, is that those members -- both the lawyers, the leg affairs team, and the members of the national security team -- will remain engaged in this effort.\xc2\xa0 So if there are specific questions that members of Congress have about the language, and they want to talk to somebody in the national security team about it, they\xe2\x80\x99ll get those phone calls returned.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf they have a more legalistic question that they would like to ask, we can certainly put them in touch with a lawyer who understands the legal argument that the administration supports.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re going to continue to stay engaged even across the wide variety of people who are involved in this ongoing effort.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question.\xc2\xa0 When the President and Chancellor Merkel spoke last week, did they discuss her diplomatic efforts with Russia in that call?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything to add to the readout of that call that we put out.\xc2\xa0 So I can pull that readout for you and give you a chance to take a look.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, a lot, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good day.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END2:04 P.M.
