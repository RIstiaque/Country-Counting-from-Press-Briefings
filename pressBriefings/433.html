Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:25 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Happy Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 I have one, quick piece of business to dispense with before we begin with questions.</p>\n<p>As you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, yesterday I began by speaking about the impact of the Affordable Care Act on extending the life of the Medicare Trust Fund.\xc2\xa0 Today we have some additional good news.\xc2\xa0 There is now available new data showing how the Affordable Care Act is helping millions of seniors save on their prescription drugs.\xc2\xa0 The Affordable Care Act makes Medicare prescription drugs more affordable by gradually closing the gap in coverage known as the doughnut hole where beneficiaries had to pay the full cost of their medications out of pocket.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Information released today by the Department of Health and Human Services shows that more than 8.2 million seniors and people with disabilities who are covered by Medicare continue to enjoy prescription drug savings as a result of the Affordable Care Act, saving a total of $11.5 billion since 2010.\xc2\xa0 That comes out to an average of about $1,400 per beneficiary in doughnut hole discounts.</p>\n<p>Now, in my home state of Missouri, where the President is traveling today, seniors have saved more than $229 million on prescription drugs since 2010, thanks to the Affordable Care Act -- $229 million goes a long way in the state of Missouri.\xc2\xa0 More than 34,000 seniors in the \xe2\x80\x9cShow-Me\xe2\x80\x9d state are seeing savings in the doughnut hole just in the first six months of this year alone.</p>\n<p>So, more good news about the impact that the Affordable Care Act is having on people all across the country -- in this case, senior citizens.</p>\n<p>So with that, Jim, do you want to get us started?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for the doughnut hole discounts.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They may not be good for your health, actually.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Diplomats in Europe are saying that the EU has adopted new economic sanctions against the Russians.\xc2\xa0 When can we expect the U.S. to follow these?\xc2\xa0 Tony Blinken said yesterday that we would come afterwards.\xc2\xa0 When do we expect to see U.S. sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I can tell you that -- I don\'t want to get ahead of a formal announcement from European leaders, but for months the United States, at a variety of levels, going all the way up to the President, has been engaged in an effort to work in close coordination with our allies to impose economic costs on Russia for their destabilizing activities in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We welcome these early indications that European countries are going to take additional steps today to impose additional economic costs on Russia.\xc2\xa0 We believe that that\'s welcome news, and we certainly look forward to continuing to coordinate with them as they move forward.</p>\n<p>In terms of economic sanctions that -- additional economic sanctions that could be imposed by the United States, let me say one other thing about this.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that just over two weeks ago, the President did make an announcement about sectoral sanctions that the United States was putting in place against Russia.\xc2\xa0 And we do anticipate that the announcement from the Europeans later today will track pretty closely with the previous announcements that have been made by this administration.</p>\n<p>In terms of additional U.S. sanctions, we have made clear that those -- that additional sanctions and additional costs could be imposed on Russia, and we do anticipate that we\'ll have some news on that soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As soon as today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As soon as today.\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about this formal accusation that Russia violated the 1987 missile treaty, and why the administration has made a determination to make that formal accusation now, since it has been an issue for quite some time?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, it\'s correct, the United States has determined, according to an intelligence analysis, that the Russian Federation is in violation of its obligations under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, the 2014 Compliance Report, which is something that we have filed on an annual basis, includes the determination that the Russian Federation is in violation of that treaty and that treaty\xe2\x80\x99s obligations not to possess, produce or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 to 5,500 kilometers, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.</p>\n<p>This is a very serious matter which we have attempted to address with Russia for some time now.\xc2\xa0 The United States is committed to the viability of the INF Treaty.\xc2\xa0 It is our view that the INF Treaty and the agreements that are part of it are in the broad national security interest of every party that has agreed to that treaty.\xc2\xa0 That includes the United States, obviously.\xc2\xa0 It includes Russia.\xc2\xa0 It includes the other 11 successor states of the former Soviet Union that are also parties to that treaty.\xc2\xa0 The adherence to that treaty also provides important safeguards for our allies in Western Europe and even some of our allies in the Asia Pacific region as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is a priority.\xc2\xa0 This is a concern, a serious concern that we have raised with the Russians on a number of occasions through our standard diplomatic channels.\xc2\xa0 I know that there have been reports that the President informed President Putin by a letter of our determination and as an indication that this is a matter that merits the serious attention of the leaders of both the United States and Russia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Congress has been asking the President and the administration to do this for some time.\xc2\xa0 Why now and not before?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, these determinations are rooted primarily in the kind of intelligence analysis that I can\xe2\x80\x99t discuss from the podium.\xc2\xa0 But it is true that this is something that we have been reviewing for some time and has been the subject of conversations within the administration and with members of Congress as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The House is moving on a pared-down immigration -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- border security bill today, I believe $690 million, quite a fraction of what you had asked for.\xc2\xa0 And it also contained some changes in the 2008 law.\xc2\xa0 In the statement of administration policy yesterday, you said that the House bill injects partisan provisions that are unworkable and would increase cost without solving the problem.\xc2\xa0 I wonder what it is that that refers to, since the administration itself had asked for changes in the 2008 law, along the lines of what the House bill does.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot there in that question.\xc2\xa0 Let me try to take those elements one at a time.\xc2\xa0 First, as it relates to language where you ended up, it is correct that almost a month ago -- I think even more than a month ago now -- the administration did put forward a specific request for Congress to take action in granting additional authority that could be used by the Secretary of Homeland Security to incorporate some flexibility in enforcing the law so that we could actually do a better job of enforcing that law more efficiently.</p>\n<p>The language that has been put forward by Senator Cornyn and Congressman Cuellar doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- it actually undermines the desire for more flexibility.\xc2\xa0 It actually puts in place a couple of arbitrary and stringent restrictions that, for example, require immigration judges to process certain cases within seven days.\xc2\xa0 That sort of inflexible approach only risks bottling up the system further.</p>\n<p>We have seen in other policymaking contexts that adding arbitrary deadlines to an already overburdened system only makes the problem worse.\xc2\xa0 And we are concerned that by putting in place these kinds of arbitrary deadlines, it puts the due process rights of those who are going through these proceedings at risk. It also could force the court system to divert resources from other higher-priority cases -- the cases of criminals or others that pose or could pose a national security threat or a public safety threat -- and direct them toward trying to meet this arbitrary seven-day restriction.</p>\n<p>So rather than granting the administration additional flexibility to more effectively enforce the law, it puts in place arbitrary constraints that make the enforcement of that law more difficult.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what our concern is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the SAP refers to partisan provisions, and the example you just provided is from a bipartisan bill.\xc2\xa0 So how can that --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as far as I know, I think that that \xe2\x80\x9cbipartisan bill\xe2\x80\x9d was supported by one Democrat.\xc2\xa0 So maybe I have a more stringent definition of bipartisanship, at least in this case.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing.</p>\n<p>In terms of the broader supplemental package that the House has put forward today, you\xe2\x80\x99re right that it falls well short of the resource request that this administration has put forward.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of House Republicans booking themselves on cable television to talk about what a serious problem this is at the border, but yet they are refusing to take the kind of action that would ensure the administration has the necessary resources to deal with what they themselves describe as a serious problem.</p>\n<p>The other thing that is notable -- and again, this piece of legislation was introduced just shortly before I walked out here, so I only got a top-line briefing on this -- but it is my understanding that this package does not include funding for wildfires.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there\'s a very serious situation out West where there are communities that are threatened in the midst of a pretty challenging wildfire season.\xc2\xa0 This administration needs additional resources to make sure that we can protect homes and communities from those wildfires, and we would like to have additional resources to do that.</p>\n<p>I would also make note of the fact that we were just talking yesterday about the valuable contribution that the Iron Dome system has made to protecting the lives of innocent civilians in our allies\xe2\x80\x99 -- in Israel, one of our closest, strongest allies.\xc2\xa0 It is unfortunate that this Republican proposal does not include the requested funding for Iron Dome.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, that system has been used to great effect in recent weeks, unfortunately.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s had to be used in recent weeks to protect the lives of innocent civilians -- in this case, innocent Israeli civilians.\xc2\xa0 And the Israeli government has made a request of the U.S. government for additional funding so that additional resources could be devoted to restocking that system, and we\xe2\x80\x99re disappointed that Republicans did not include that in the proposal as we had requested.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on the INF Treaty, what exactly did the Russians do?\xc2\xa0 Did they launch a cruise missile?\xc2\xa0 And what sort of response are you getting to your complaints from them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Steve, I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to detail the intelligence behind the analysis that led to the determination that was included in the 2014 Compliance Report, so it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to answer in a lot of detail the basics of your question.\xc2\xa0 But let me repeat that there is an obligation on both countries -- on all parties, I should say, who have signed that treaty not to possess, produce or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 to 5,500 kilometers, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles.\xc2\xa0 We have raised concerns with the Russians about the importance of complying with this aspect of the treaty, and I guess suffice it to say that the response that we received from them was unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Separately, Israeli TV says all parties have agreed to a Gaza cease-fire.\xc2\xa0 Is this something you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is not something I was aware of before I walked out here, but that may have been a breaking-news item on Israeli television.\xc2\xa0 As you know, this administration and the President and Secretary Kerry have all been pushing both sides to impose an immediate cease-fire out of concern for the well-being of innocent civilians on both sides of that border.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to look into those reports, but if true, it would certainly reflect what this administration has been encouraging both sides to pursue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, Speaker Boehner says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have no plans to impeach the President.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He called it a scam to raise money, raising this issue.\xc2\xa0 Was it a scam?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, then I suspect that there may be members of the Republican conference that didn\xe2\x80\x99t receive the memo.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen comments in recent months from Congressman Steve King from Iowa, Congressman Ted Yoho from Florida, Congressman Lou Barletta from Pennsylvania, the distinguished Congressman Steve Stockman from Texas; his fellow Texan, Blake Farenthold, has raised this prospect.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve even seen Kerry Bentivolio from Michigan call this a \xe2\x80\x9cdream come true.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I think that was about nine or 10 months ago.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that if this is the case then maybe the Speaker should direct that attention and that message to members of his own conference.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Ukraine again, the fact that Ukraine has now fired missiles at the rebels, does the U.S. see that as an escalation of this, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that just raise the possibility that Russia will use its own missiles that the U.S. is so concerned about as it concerns the treaty?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have seen evidence to indicate that the Russians have fired weapons from the Russian side of the border aimed squarely at Ukrainian forces.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy National Security Advisor, Tony Blinken, mentioned from this podium just yesterday.\xc2\xa0 That does reflect what we think is an escalation in this conflict, and it only underscores the importance of the international community taking action to impose further economic costs on the Russians to get them to reevaluate their strategy in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I mean Ukraine firing missiles now at the rebels.\xc2\xa0 Apparently they\xe2\x80\x99ve used ballistic missiles as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I misunderstood your question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s okay.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was referring to previous reports that Russian forces on the Russian side of the border were targeting the Ukrainian military forces on the Ukrainian side of the border.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. concerned that Ukraine is now dangerously escalating this past the point that it could or should?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to talk about those specific reports.\xc2\xa0 It is our view, however, that military actions that are taken by the Ukrainian military reflect the aggressive efforts of Russian separatists to perpetuate the violence in that region of the world.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to talk about those specific reports, but we do continue to be concerned about ongoing violence there and we do encourage the Russians to use their influence with the Russian-backed separatists to lay down their arms and to try to resolve their differences diplomatically.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And today we heard Kerry again emphasizing a diplomatic solution, saying that Putin has all of these choices.\xc2\xa0 But hasn\xe2\x80\x99t this now gotten past that point?\xc2\xa0 I mean, Russian has contributed to the downing of a commercial plane and has annexed part of its neighbor.\xc2\xa0 So at this point what would a diplomatic solution even look like in the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s view?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have said is that it is possible for us to set up a political dialogue that would allow the people of Ukraine to determine the future of their country.\xc2\xa0 There is a debate in that country that raises questions about what sort of relationship Ukraine should have with their neighbor Russia.\xc2\xa0 It raises questions about what sort of relationship Ukraine should have with their economic partners in Western Europe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, many of those questions have been resolved, because in the last six months or so -- maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit longer than that, eight or nine months -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the election of a new Ukrainian President; we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that Ukrainian President sign an association agreement with the Europeans that was the subject of so much dispute, that led to the departure of the previous President.\xc2\xa0 So that is an indication that the Ukrainian people do want to have a strong relationship with Europe.</p>\n<p>The point that the United States and much of the international community has been trying to make is their strong relationship with Western Europe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- doesn\'t necessarily mean that they have to have an adversarial or contentious relationship with their neighbor Russia.\xc2\xa0 It is possible for the Ukrainian people to have strong relationships with both.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, what we have seen is we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Russians feel undermined by the desire of the Ukrainian people to have a relationship with the West.\xc2\xa0 And that is what has led them to unnecessarily and improperly interfere with the affairs of the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people.</p>\n<p>So, ultimately, what we would like to see is a way to resolve this politically so that the Ukrainian people do continue to hold the authority to make decisions about the future of their country, and that they have the freedom to make decisions about what they would like their relationship to be with countries around the world -- even holding open the prospect that Ukraine has a strong and thriving relationship with Russia.\xc2\xa0 Their strong relationship with the West would not preclude their close ties to their neighbor.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really quickly, the Russian Foreign Minister just announced that he\xe2\x80\x99s agreed with John Kerry to work toward ways to implement the agreements in Geneva back in April.\xc2\xa0 How does the U.S. view these announcements periodically from the Foreign Minister?\xc2\xa0 Do you see that as positive, or do you just see it as more lip service that really means nothing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have seen throughout this conflict in Ukraine are announcements from the Russians that are not necessarily backed up by concrete actions.\xc2\xa0 And that has been the source of some disappointment and even some frustration on the part of the international community.\xc2\xa0 That is why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the international community progressively take the kinds of steps that have imposed greater costs on the Russians to further isolate them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All of this is part of not just putting in place a sanctions regime for the sake of sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Rather the sanctions regime is geared toward prompting President Putin principally, but the broader Russian government, to reevaluate their strategy in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Their efforts to destabilize Ukraine have weakened their country politically and have hurt their relationship with their neighbor.\xc2\xa0 It also, after the imposition of some of these sanctions, has had a negative impact on the Russian economy.</p>\n<p>So what we need is we need President Putin to reevaluate his strategy and actually participate constructively in that situation by engaging in the kinds of facilitated diplomatic talks that would de-escalate that conflict and allow the people of Ukraine to make the kinds of decisions that they should make about the future of their country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Margaret.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know that the President is waiting until the end of the summer but is likely to make some fairly big moves on immigration.\xc2\xa0 And now we understand from lawmakers on the Hill and advocates that the White House has begun talking about the possibility of the executive order to issue at least some work permits before the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go out on a limb and anticipate that you might not want to get ahead of an official announcement --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You know me so well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you could talk in some general terms at least about whether this is something that you\xe2\x80\x99re exploring, the politics of exploring it before midterm, and how many people you\xe2\x80\x99re looking realistically to cover.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Margaret, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that in the Rose Garden about a month ago, the President delivered a statement in which he communicated to the American public and to all of you that he had been informed by the Speaker of the House that House Republicans were for the foreseeable future going to block the common-sense, bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And in response to that declaration from the Speaker of the House, the President announced his intention to review the authority that was vested in the executive branch to see what tools were available to him to address some of the problems with our broken immigration system that House Republicans won\xe2\x80\x99t allow the Congress to solve.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is not comfortable just sitting in place, waiting for Congress to act, particularly when Congress, in bipartisan fashion in the Senate at least, has identified a common-sense approach for addressing so many of these problems.</p>\n<p>So what is underway right now is a review, at the order of the President, by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to consider what options are available to the President.\xc2\xa0 What those options reflect is a determination by this President, as I mentioned, to act where Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, but to do so within the confines of the law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re taking our time to carefully review what the existing law is and what steps it allows the President to take in terms of addressing the problems that are caused by our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And once that review has been concluded and it has been made clear to the President what options are available to him I anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an announcement about steps that the President has decided to take to address some of these problems.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- speak from the podium, though, that this work permit is one of those options that\xe2\x80\x99s being studied right now, that your team is considering presenting --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to talk about what sorts of things are currently under review.\xc2\xa0 That review is being conducted by the Department of Justice and by the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 And for the content and timing of that review, you can check with them, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t spend a whole lot of time waiting for an answer.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What concerns exactly do you have about the Russian testing of missiles?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been going -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve known about it since 2008.\xc2\xa0 What do you believe they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to talk in specific detail about the intelligence analysis that led us to this specific determination.\xc2\xa0 I think it would be fair for you to conclude that the concerns we have specifically relate to the Russians failing to uphold their obligation not to possess, produce or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, or to possess or produce launchers of missiles like that.</p>\n<p>It is correct that the concerns that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had about this have been raised with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s correct that our concerns have been discussed inside the administration for some time.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s correct to assume that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had conversations with our partners on the relevant committees in Congress about this, as well.\xc2\xa0 The reason for all of that consultation and careful study is that the INF Treaty, as it is known, is an important part of our national security.\xc2\xa0 It also provides for the national security for the people of Russia.\xc2\xa0 It also provides the national security of some of our strongest allies both in Western Europe and the Asia Pacific region.</p>\n<p>So this is a top priority.\xc2\xa0 That is why it has been raised at the presidential level.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with Russia -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve offered to engage in a high-level dialogue with them so that they can resolve our concerns of this matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that they would use these missiles or make them available to other states?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Our concern principally now is with their commitment to this treaty, and that is what we intend to hold them accountable for, which is living up to the commitments that they made in the context of this treaty.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t do so solely because it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of the United States and our national security for them to do so; we believe that it is in the strong national security interest of our allies and we actually believe it\xe2\x80\x99s in the strong national security interests of the Russians to abide by this agreement.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to hold them to living up to the commitments that they made, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to live up to those commitments because, again, we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s in the clear national security interests of the United States of America for us to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- have looked into this and they consider the matter closed.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have had, as I alluded to a little bit earlier, some conversations with the Russians about this where we raised our concerns, and again, it is fair for you to conclude that their response to our concerns was wholly unsatisfactory, and that is why additional talks are merited.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that the Russians will take us up on our offer to conduct those conversations at a pretty high level.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more time -- are you concerned that they could possibly use or make available these missiles for other purposes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We are concerned with ensuring that the Russians live up to the commitments that they made in the context of the INF Treaty for a whole host of reasons.\xc2\xa0 Certainly proliferation -- the proliferation risk associated with these kinds of weapons is part of the wide range of concerns that makes this treaty such an important document.</p>\n<p>Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Vladimir Putin was quoted last year as saying that former President Gorbachev\xe2\x80\x99s decision to sign the INF Treaty was debatable at best.\xc2\xa0 Why do you believe he has any commitment to the treaty?\xc2\xa0 And what if he does not?\xc2\xa0 What if he wants to get rid of it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s certainly -- I would assume that\'s the kind of thing that would come up in the high-level talks that we\xe2\x80\x99re offering to have with the Russians.</p>\n<p>What we believe is really important is for both sides to live up to the agreements that have already been signed.\xc2\xa0 The United States has lived up to our end of the agreement.\xc2\xa0 We believe that doing so is in the clear national security interest of the United States, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the clear interest of our allies in Western Europe and in the Asia Pacific, and we believe it is in the clear interest of the Russian people for this treaty to remain in effect and for both sides -- and for all sides, all parties to live up to the agreements that they made in the context of this agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what if he does not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that is the subject of some conversation.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to having a dialogue at a high level to assess the willingness of the Russian regime to live up to the obligations that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about Putin\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the U.S. plans to station Aegis missiles in Romania is itself a violation of the treaty?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is not.\xc2\xa0 Again, the United States remains committed to abiding by these security agreements that we have signed with Russia.\xc2\xa0 And again, we do that because it is in the clear national security interest of the United States to live up to the commitments that we have made on the international scene. We can do that in the context of also providing for the national security of our allies in Europe, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do that as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is it not a violation of the treaty?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department for sort of the detailed ins and outs of these kinds of treaty agreements.\xc2\xa0 But we take them very seriously.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also why we take it seriously when our partners who also sign these treaties don\'t live up to the commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Israeli TV is now retracting that report on the cease-fire.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for keeping us up to date here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shocking.\xc2\xa0 But in the context of the criticism which most people would suggest it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to remember when there has been such hostility in Israeli media against a U.S. Secretary of State -- in fact, Secretary Kerry again defended his record, saying 29 years in the Senate, 100 percent voting record.\xc2\xa0 But is all of this having a negative impact on his ability to help broker a real cease-fire?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We do not think so.\xc2\xa0 The United States certainly does not think so.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry, as Mr. Blinken noted yesterday, is a strong defender of our allies in Israel.\xc2\xa0 And that is why I guess I would be so bold as to suggest that it is in the interest of the Israeli people for the harsh words that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen directed at the Secretary not affect his ability to continue to be a strong advocate for them.</p>\n<p>Secretary Kerry has worked doggedly over the last year or so since he took office -- I guess it has been a little longer than that -- pressing both sides in terms of a broader -- to the negotiating table in search of a broader peace agreement.\xc2\xa0 What he has been engaged in more recently is working with Palestinian leaders, Israeli leaders, other leaders in the Arab world, U.N. officials, to try to put in place a permanent cessation of hostilities based on the November 2012 cease-fire agreement.</p>\n<p>Secretary Kerry has been working hard on that effort because, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the clear interest of American national security for that cease-fire to be put in place.\xc2\xa0 It also will provide for the protection of innocent civilians on both sides of the border that, right now, are caught in the cross-fire.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so he is going to continue to work very hard on this, and he is an important element of resolving this situation because he is somebody who is well-versed in all these issues; he is somebody who has the clear backing of the President of the United States; he is somebody that has very good relationships with both Israeli leaders and Palestinian leaders.\xc2\xa0 This is credibility that he has built up through his years of service to this administration in pursuit of that goal.\xc2\xa0 And I anticipate, and this administration anticipates, and the President anticipates that he is going to continue to be hard at work on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, there have been multiple reports in the Israeli media quoting senior Israeli officials, one of the toughest in Haaretz yesterday, saying that senior officials believed that the proposal put forward by John Kerry was a \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic terrorist attack.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you not believe those reports? How would you categorize the feelings of senior officials then if you don\xe2\x80\x99t think that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the facts.\xc2\xa0 The facts are that the cease-fire proposal that was put forward by the Egyptians two weeks ago -- this is the cease-fire agreement that Israel readily accepted -- included many of the elements that some anonymous Israeli officials are now suggesting were wrongly included in the document that was circulated by Secretary Kerry.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the second thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand, is this is a document that was circulated among the parties that reflected an attempt to get a dialogue going between the parties.\xc2\xa0 This did not reflect a specific American proposal. This reflected an effort to try to find some common ground and to elicit comment from the Israelis to try to find the kind of cease-fire agreement that they would believe would be in their best interests, and would also provide for greater security of their citizens.</p>\n<p>So this is part of the diplomatic effort that was underway, and it is in line with the proposal that the Israelis had readily agreed to a couple of weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 So those facts as it relates to the document that we circulated by Secretary Kerry are really important in this case.</p>\n<p>In terms of the broader relationship, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve said for a couple of days now that those comments were pretty disappointing.\xc2\xa0 But our determination, and more importantly, Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s determination to try to put in place an immediate cease-fire that would end the crossfire that so many civilians -- innocent civilians are caught in the middle of right now continues to be a top priority.\xc2\xa0 And I know that he\xe2\x80\x99s working very hard as we speak in pursuit of that agreement.</p>\n<p>Bob.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back to the sanctions anticipated today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t suppose you\'re going to want to put it this way, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t it perhaps a fair assessment to say that it took the shooting-down of a commercial jetliner to have the European leaders get some serious shivers finally about Vladimir Putin?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the tipping point of all of this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would leave that sort of analysis to others.\xc2\xa0 I would point out a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is the announcement that we anticipate later today from the Europeans is the culmination of months of diplomatic work that has been conducted by members of this administration, and it reflects the commitment of the international community, led by this President, to respond to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Now, I think the President himself, when he spoke at this podium 10 days or so ago, acknowledged that the downing of that jetliner with 300 innocent people aboard was a head-snapper and would attract the attention of the international community in a way that this conflict hadn\xe2\x80\x99t previously.\xc2\xa0 So I think it is certainly reasonable, the prospect that you floated, that the downing of this airliner contributed significantly to the Europeans\xe2\x80\x99 willingness to step up to the plate and take the kind of serious action that this administration and this country put in place against Russia a couple of weeks ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But this work continues.\xc2\xa0 This is not the finish line here. There are still -- we need to assess whether or not these economic costs that are being imposed on Russia have the desired effect.\xc2\xa0 The desired effect, again, is to get President Putin to reevaluate his strategy for Ukraine, and that remains to be seen. But I suspect we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little more on this today after the Europeans announce their decision.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, Monday starts the U.S.-Africa Summit.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk to us about it?\xc2\xa0 And what news will come out of this investment in Africa?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give away all of the news six days before the conference starts, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Give us some.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it a shot here.\xc2\xa0 The President is looking forward to welcoming leaders from across the African continent to our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Capital for a three-day U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.\xc2\xa0 This summit, the largest event any U.S. President has held with African heads of state and government, will build on the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Africa in the summer of 2013, and it will strengthen ties between the United States and one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most dynamic and fastest-growing regions.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the summit will advance the administration\xe2\x80\x99s focus on trade and investment in Africa, and highlight America\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Africa\xe2\x80\x99s security, its democratic development, and its people.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, it will highlight the depth and breadth of the U.S. commitment to the African continent, advance our shared priorities, and enable discussion of concrete ideas to deepen that partnership.\xc2\xa0 At its core, this summit is about fostering stronger ties between the United States and Africa.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when you talk about this, is this -- we understand the investment piece, but is this also going to shore up some of the African countries that may have some issues with policy as well as -- domestic policy as well as security -- as many Africa nations are places where terrorists do go and run and stay there to breed and hide -- is this part of that as well?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I do anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to discuss in the context of this summit, April, is a wide range of topics.\xc2\xa0 You touched on some of them there.\xc2\xa0 But we do want to try to encourage progress in a few key areas that are so critical to the future of that continent.\xc2\xa0 Those areas include expanding trade and investment ties, engaging young African leaders, promoting inclusive, sustainable development, expanding cooperation on peace and security, and gaining a better future for Africa\xe2\x80\x99s next generation.</p>\n<p>You saw the President allude to some of that in the town hall meeting that he did in the context of the Young African Leaders Initiative just yesterday, where the President talked about the importance of engaging Africa\xe2\x80\x99s young leaders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All across that continent we see that there is a whole generation of young leaders who are poised to decide the future of that continent and their individual countries, and the opportunity that we can seize to engage them and conduct discussions about trade and investment and leadership, and promoting inclusive, sustainable development, and a focus on peace and security are the kinds of things that may not pay dividends right away, but they are the kinds of things that will build strong ties between the U.S. and one of the most dynamic regions of the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question on investment and trade.\xc2\xa0 I asked this question of you a couple weeks ago and I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping I get an answer now.\xc2\xa0 I asked you about how China in the past -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a concern about how China was investing particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, making promises that at one time they were not keeping.\xc2\xa0 They were taking more out than they were giving.\xc2\xa0 Will there be some forms of accountability for these investments from these U.S. companies, U.S. organizations, that there is a mutual win-win, versus you take more than you give -- you put in?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the operating premise of the summit is the idea that there is an opportunity for both the African continent and the United States of America to benefit from stronger ties between our countries and our people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Those ties benefit both sides in a variety of ways, I think. We certainly would benefit from some of the security arrangements that are already in place with some countries in that region.\xc2\xa0 But encouraging the leaders of these countries to play a more constructive role in fostering peace and security is certainly one obvious way that these kinds of stronger relationships could benefit the American people in a way that they would also benefit the African people, as well.</p>\n<p>I think the same could be said of economic ties between business interests in Africa and business interests in the United States who are looking for growing markets.\xc2\xa0 Some of these African countries include among the fastest-growing, most dynamic economic markets in the world.\xc2\xa0 So giving American businesses the opportunity to invest in those areas certainly makes good business sense for a lot of companies here in the U.S., but also would stand to yield significant economic benefits for people who live in those countries.\xc2\xa0 So this will be the topic of a lot of conversation both at a government level, but also among the private sector leaders who are participating in the summit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Lesley.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to a letter sent to the White House by Senators from Colorado and Washington asking for more clarity and perhaps a unified approach in helping license marijuana businesses?\xc2\xa0 They said that -- they have criticism that at times it seems like some different arms of the government have been at odds over how to enforce the law.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that letter, Lesley, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice, who, as we discussed yesterday, has put in place some guidelines for administering the law in the unique circumstances that exist in Colorado and Washington State.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about some of the criticism, though, that -- like the Bureau of Land Management is doing one thing on water reclamation and DOJ is enforcing it in a different manner -- is there any sort of review underway?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to the Bureau of Land Management, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with the Department of the Interior, and they may be able to give you some more details about how they\xe2\x80\x99re untangling any regulatory knots that may exist there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back to the situation in Gaza.\xc2\xa0 The President talked to Prime Minister Netanyahu on Sunday.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You put out a readout saying that, \xe2\x80\x9cThe President made clear the strategic imperative of instituting an immediate, unconditional humanitarian cease-fire that ends hostilities now.\xe2\x80\x9d The Israelis responded by going to some of their most aggressive offensive operations into Gaza of the entire conflict.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s level of frustration with the fact that he gives a very strong what looks almost like an order -- gives very strong words telling the Israeli Prime Minister that we must have \xe2\x80\x9can immediate, unconditional humanitarian cease-fire\xe2\x80\x9d and then, he goes in the opposite direction?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty steadfast.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also included in that readout that the United States continues to not just acknowledge but support the Israeli government\xe2\x80\x99s right to take steps to defend their civilians.\xc2\xa0 And that Israeli right to self-defense is something that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just respect, he supports.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he support what the Israelis have done over the last 24 hours, or what they have done in the hours after that phone call?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President has said is that he supports the Israeli government\xe2\x80\x99s right to make those decisions. What we have also suggested is that Russia -- that the Israelis need to do more to live up to the standards that they have set for themselves to ensure the safety of innocent civilians on both sides of that border, including Palestinian people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it is apparent from the reports that we have seen about the civilian deaths that there is more that the Israeli military can and should do to account for the safety of Palestinian civilians.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember, though, that there is a distinction here, which is that Hamas is routinely targeting innocent civilians on the other side of the border.\xc2\xa0 The Israeli military puts in place standards to try to protect Palestinian civilians -- innocent Palestinian civilians.\xc2\xa0 That said, we believe that the Israeli military should do more to live up to those standards.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And moving on to the question of impeachment, did you coordinate your comments on Monday about impeachment with the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, did you coordinate your comments on Friday about impeachment with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you coordinated, or you didn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the reason why I ask is Dan Pfeiffer says what he says Friday morning, that impeachment is a real possibility the White House is concerned about.\xc2\xa0 You go a little bit further from the podium during the briefing.\xc2\xa0 And then within hours, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is putting out fundraising emails quoting what you said with a red alert:\xc2\xa0 the White House says impeachment is a real possibility, we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about impeachment.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, it seems -- Pfeiffer says something, you say something, then you have a fundraising drive that they\xe2\x80\x99re now saying is one of the most successful fundraising drives of the cycle.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I know, Jon, is that the comments that I made on Friday were in response to questions from people who were asking about the prospect of Republicans in Congress taking that step.\xc2\xa0 So it would be --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you coordinated with the DCCC?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that it would be difficult for me to coordinate what I was going to say in response to a question that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been asked yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you had your answer, which was quite forward-leaning, saying the top Republicans are pushing impeachment, and I think your answer at the time was, for an example, was Sarah Palin.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, true.\xc2\xa0 That was not an answer that I had discussed with anybody at the DCCC in advance.\xc2\xa0 Again, this was based on my own reading of the newspaper a couple days before I got asked the question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re a pretty calm guy -- (laughter) -- but the DCCC put out a fundraiser saying -- this is after your words -- \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Saturday and we\xe2\x80\x99re in the office freaking out.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is the White House freaking out about the possibility of impeachment?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it would be appropriate for you to characterize the White House sentiment that we are very disappointed that, in this pivotal week before Congress embarks on a five-week long August recess, as they have in previous years, that they\xe2\x80\x99re spending so much time debating a taxpayer-funded lawsuit that they are prepared to file against the President just for doing his job, instead of focusing on some of these other priorities that should get done before Labor Day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not freaking out about impeachment?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it is fair to say that we believe that the Republican priorities that they have articulated are completely wrong and don\xe2\x80\x99t reflect the view of so many middle-class families; that their elected leaders in Washington, D.C., should be focused on putting into place the kinds of policies that are going to expand economic opportunity for the middle class; and that efforts to focus on these political partisan attacks don\xe2\x80\x99t create jobs, they don\xe2\x80\x99t reduce the deficit, they don\xe2\x80\x99t make things better for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is focused on these priorities.\xc2\xa0 We wish that House Republicans would be focused on them, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, specifically on the priorities, one big thing is dealing with the border crisis.\xc2\xa0 So the Senate -- Senate Democrats have moved in one direction; House Republicans are moving in another direction.\xc2\xa0 Both are putting out -- off money, saying that they would appropriate money to deal with the crisis -- obviously the Republicans less in the House.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a little -- there\xe2\x80\x99s disagreement on some of the policy.\xc2\xa0 Are you going to insist -- is the White House going to insist that Congress delay its five-week congressional recess until it can resolve the differences between those two approaches and deal with the border crisis?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any proclamations to make about our views of the congressional schedule at this point other than to observe that this administration, more than three weeks ago, put forward our own specific request about what we felt like needed to be done, and here we are, three days before Congress is prepared to leave town for the remainder of the summer, and we see a preliminary proposal from House Republicans.\xc2\xa0 That is not acting with a sense of urgency that we feel is necessary to deal with this situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This administration has demonstrated a whole-of-government approach to try to deal with the problem at the border and to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re mitigating the impact that\xe2\x80\x99s having on communities across the border.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, that whole-of-government approach that has a sense of urgency doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include Republicans in Congress right now.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow, but would you veto -- would the President veto the House bill as it stands now, the House supplemental?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I was just briefed on the very top-line details.\xc2\xa0 I understand that our folks here at the White House, our experts here at the White House are reviewing the details of that legislation, and if we get to a position where we have a more specific position to express, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I also ask, do you have any readout of the meeting that was this morning with the House Democrats?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout in front of me.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Zeke.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go into too much detail about how that determination was made, but was the decision to go public last night at all tied to the current state of relations, or lack thereof, between the United States and Russia -- to send a letter -- start distributing that information to the press related to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it was not.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about before, Zeke, the relationship between the United States and Russia is a multifaceted one.\xc2\xa0 We have worked in cooperative fashion with the Russians even in the midst of this turmoil in Ukraine to rid Syria of their declared chemical weapons stockpile.\xc2\xa0 That was an important -- that reflected important cooperation between our two governments in pursuit of a goal that was in the clear national security interests of the American people, of the Russian people, and of people around the globe.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also been working closely with the Russians as it relates to the ongoing P5-plus-1 talks with Iran.\xc2\xa0 So it is possible for us to consider a wide range of aspects in our relationship.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Dealing with these issues in isolation, this is yet another factor in our relationship with Russia and it is something that we continue to be concerned about.\xc2\xa0 The decision to reach this determination, again, was based on intelligence analysis.\xc2\xa0 And the decision to make it public was based on our filing of the 2014 Compliance Report, something that\'s done on an annual basis. And the letter that was sent from President Obama to President Putin is pursuant to the filing of that Compliance Report and our intention to make clear to the Russian government that this is a very serious matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to drill down there for a second, you mentioned earlier that there was concerns of -- potentially about proliferation of these weapons.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in eastern Ukraine, the separatists are being sort of given surface-to-air missiles, as the administration alleges, as well as heavy weaponry, artillery and the like.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s not a factor here in that -- was it a factor in that determination?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a difficult question you\xe2\x80\x99re asking primarily because you\xe2\x80\x99re asking about our -- you\xe2\x80\x99re alluding to an intelligence analysis that\'s difficult for me to discuss from here.\xc2\xa0 Let me just say as a top-line matter, we have on many occasions expressed our serious concerns about heavy weapons being transferred from Russia across the border into Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We have seen those heavy weapons used by Russian-backed separatists, occasionally with very tragic results.</p>\n<p>As it relates to our concerns about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s obligations under the treaty, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to talk about some of that intelligence analysis, but what I can say is that our concerns about the Russians living up to their obligations not to possess, produce or flight-test a ground-launch cruise missile with a range capability of 500 to 5,500 kilometers, or possess or produce launchers of such missiles is a concern that we would have even if the Russians were acting in a much more responsible fashion in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just finally, there seems to be another dustup now between Secretary Kerry and the Israeli government, with Secretary Kerry saying a couple of hours ago that Prime Minister Netanyahu had asked him to broker a cease-fire in a call late last night; now the senior Israeli officials are telling reporters that that conversation didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, in fact it was the other way around.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you could clarify -- do you know whether, in their conversation with the President on Sunday, or with Secretary Kerry last night, did Prime Minister Netanyahu ask the U.S. government to broker a cease-fire?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the United States has been engaged -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to read out a phone call between the Secretary of State and the Israeli Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department for that.\xc2\xa0 I might hold it up as evidence that there is -- that there continues to be an important role played by the Secretary of State in working on this situation.</p>\n<p>However, it is the view of the United States that it is in the clear interest of people on both sides of that conflict for an immediate cease-fire to be put in place.\xc2\xa0 It is tragic the violence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in that region, and it is tragic how many innocent lives have been lost as a result of that conflict.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat is why the Secretary of State, the President of the United States, and other American officials are working so hard to try to put in place that cease-fire.\xc2\xa0 Enough tragedy has been experienced by people on both sides of that conflict.\xc2\xa0 It needs to come to an end.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s time for parties on both sides to try to reserve their differences diplomatically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you elaborate at all on what you describe as a \xe2\x80\x9cwholly unsatisfactory response\xe2\x80\x9d by Russia to the INF charge?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to elaborate on that further.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty colorful description.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the diplomatic equivalent of \xe2\x80\x9cbite me\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That might be an even more colorful description of that conversation, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to describe that conversation any further.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on Ukraine, the administration continues to ask that there be unfettered access for an investigation into the crash site.\xc2\xa0 At what point does it go beyond the point where it would be of any value by virtue of the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s been 10 days that all of the material is out in the open, tampered with, stolen?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are experts who could make that assessment.\xc2\xa0 And what we want to ensure is that the Dutch and the Australians and others who are working with the government of Ukraine to try to finalize a plan for international investigators to get access to that site, that they\xe2\x80\x99re in a position to do their work.\xc2\xa0 And we want these international investigators to carefully look at what evidence does remain to get the best possible assessment about what exactly happened.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It should be clearly in the interest of everybody involved on both sides of this debate for us to get a fair, unbiased, international assessment of what exactly happened.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re supporting the efforts of the Dutch, the Australians and the Ukrainians to allow international investigators to get unfettered access to the scene.</p>\n<p>Isaac.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given all that you\xe2\x80\x99ve said about the impeachment situation -- Dan Pfeiffer said it\xe2\x80\x99s a serious topic being bandied about --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- and Ted Yoho and Steve Stockman and others have said about this situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House feel, and does the President feel that Democrats should stop fundraising on this topic?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is up to Democrats to make their own decisions about ensuring that their candidates have the resources necessary to run successful campaigns in the fall.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s always been the case.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to comment on their strategy or tactics at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But aren\xe2\x80\x99t they just as culpable in making this a topic that\xe2\x80\x99s being run about?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there were, I don\'t know, 20 fundraising emails the DCCC and the House Majority PAC put out about impeachment over the weekend.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the people who are culpable for this are the people who have the prospect of voting to do exactly what they say should be done.\xc2\xa0 That is something that we believe reflects a whole set of priorities that stand in stark contrast to the priorities that are shared by middle-class families all across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, what the vast majority of people want their elected leaders in Washington, D.C., to be focused on, and what the President is focused on, is what can we do to put in place policies that will make it easier for middle-class families to raise a family, send their kids to college, save for retirement, buy a home, to live the American Dream.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that continues to be the President\xe2\x80\x99s focal point when it comes to his domestic policy agenda.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear the President talk about this quite a bit more tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the priority that is shared by Kerry Bentivolio, who says that impeaching the President would be \xe2\x80\x9ca dream come true.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You want Republicans to stop talking about it, but not the Democrats to stop fundraising on it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, what I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that the priorities of the Republican Congress are all wrong.\xc2\xa0 And I will leave it to Democratic strategists, who have a much better sense than I do about the best way to raise money for their campaign committees. What we would all benefit from, and what middle-class families across the country would benefit from would be from elected leaders in Washington, D.C. doing what the President is doing, which is setting aside partisan differences and trying to find common ground in pursuit of policies that everybody agrees would be in the best interest of middle-class families.</p>\n<p>Kathleen, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify on the missile treaty, can you confirm that the letter yesterday was the first time that the President has raised this issue with Putin directly?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to check on that.\xc2\xa0 I believe that it is, but let me check with our national security folks and we will let you know.\xc2\xa0 I know that this was raised at a variety of levels prior to that letter being sent.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it was raised between the two Presidents prior to that letter being sent.\xc2\xa0 So let me check on it.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:22 P.M.
