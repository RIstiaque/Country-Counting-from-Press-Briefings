BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Hi, guys.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re just going to go ahead and just get started.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going to leap right in?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So can we talk about the politics of the offshore drilling announcement?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both sides.\xc2\xa0 How can -- can you guys afford to kind of anger the environmentalists, sort of liberal side of your base, with the pretty expansive decision on offshore drilling?\xc2\xa0 And then, on the other side, how much do you think it can actually help in bringing Republicans along on climate change?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that what we need to do here is take a comprehensive approach to energy policy.\xc2\xa0 And there are people on the right who support some aspects of that; there\xe2\x80\x99s people on the left who support some aspects of that.\xc2\xa0 But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into this looking at what the political coalition was going to be getting if this passed.\xc2\xa0 He went into this thinking what\xe2\x80\x99s the best policy for our country and how do we get it done.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s something that he talked about on the campaign trail; it\xe2\x80\x99s something that he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about for a very long time.\xc2\xa0 So I think that for people who have followed the President, a lot of this policy isn\xe2\x80\x99t much of a surprise to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 One thing I would say, though, Jennifer, is just that I was -- the President was encouraged this morning to see Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s spokesperson say that this was an issue that he had spoken specifically with President Obama about.\xc2\xa0 And so it does look like there\xe2\x80\x99s some support on both sides of the aisle.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have a rigorous debate about this and hopefully get something done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, can you talk, though, specifically about environmentalists?\xc2\xa0 Obviously they\xe2\x80\x99re not happy with the way this decision played out.\xc2\xa0 So how much can you afford -- understood that it\xe2\x80\x99s a decision he had kind of hinted at, hinted he was going to make, but at the same time he has to deal with the fallout from that decision.\xc2\xa0 So how does that play out for you?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re the Democratic Party; we often have disagreements among our friends.\xc2\xa0 But the President is going to continue to talk to folks in the environmental community, and people in the Democratic Party, and people in the Republican Party, to make the most amount of progress that we can make on this critical issue.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important because we need to decrease our dependence on foreign oil and we need to move forward on some of these investments in order to create some of the most important jobs that we can create here in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>The President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that the country that comes out on top -- on investments in renewable energy and on creating new technology -- is going to be leader in the 21st century, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not playing for second place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the drilling announced today -- there was no thought about the implications this might have for advancing the climate change legislation that seems to be running into obstacles in Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a part of the climate legislation and the entire package that the President is working with Congress to move forward.\xc2\xa0 So I would say that this is mostly about coming through on a promise that he made to the American people that he would have a comprehensive energy plan that would include some increased domestic production of energy but also some big investments in renewable technology, as well as finding ways to promote efficiency and things like that. So all these things are connected.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Robert yesterday showed sort of acceptance of a timetable of getting financial regulatory reform through Congress onto the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk by no later than September.\xc2\xa0 What is the timetable you all are thinking of for climate change legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have specific dates for you necessarily, but this is something that the President thinks we need to move forward on as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0 As recently as a couple weeks ago he had a bipartisan group of senators into the White House to talk about some of the proposals that they have, some ways that we can come together in order to make progress on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to work with them in order to make progress as fast as we can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that this can be done before the midterm elections in November?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 His goal is to do this as fast as he possibly can.</p>\n<p>Yunji.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, what changed?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President, again and again on the campaign trail, said that this was -- this would be insignificant, that expanding these kind of leases would not do much in terms of consumer relief, short term or long term. So what\xe2\x80\x99s different?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President said was that there\xe2\x80\x99s no silver bullet when it comes to decreasing our dependence on foreign oil and having a comprehensive view on energy.\xc2\xa0 If you remember the conversation that was being had, a lot of people treated offshore drilling as a panacea to solve all of our problems as it related to energy.\xc2\xa0 But what the President thought was that it just had to be one part of a comprehensive strategy to dealing with that.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why, over the course of the presidency, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him, at the State of the Union, talk about this, and in other venues talk about it.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talked about increasing production of domestic oil.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talked about finding ways to get nuclear energy moving in this country, clean coal moving in this country, and all those different things.</p>\n<p>But along with the increased production, he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about ways to make vehicles more efficient.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s new fuel-efficiency standards, which is something that was very hard to get an agreement on but, bringing all the relevant parties to the table, he was able to.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s done things to make the federal fleet more fuel efficient, using hybrid vehicles, buying plug-in cars, to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can, from the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s standpoint, in order to decrease our dependence on foreign oil.</p>\n<p>So nothing has changed.\xc2\xa0 What you see here today is a fulfillment of what the President said he was going to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President said that this was insignificant.\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s insignificant, then -- and you have the kind of political fallout that Jennifer is talking about potentially happening, then what makes this worth it?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 What the President said was that this in and of itself would not be enough to get us on a path to energy independence, and so as one part of his strategy, finding places where you can reasonably and safely drill offshore to increase production is a key part of that.\xc2\xa0 So -- but it\xe2\x80\x99s just one part of that.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what he said in the campaign and that\'s what he\xe2\x80\x99s following through on today.</p>\n<p>Dan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did the President not go further in terms of drilling off of Alaska where it\xe2\x80\x99s believed there are a lot of resources?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President thinks we ought to do is use the best science available and the safest methods that we can in order to find oil and gas, and then go and retrieve it and use it domestically.\xc2\xa0 So what this proposal represents is what he and the team of experts around him think is the best way to go about that in the most responsible and safe way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On health care, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on behind the scenes in terms of the President selling to the American people -- beyond just the trip that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing this week -- selling to the American people the short-term and long-term benefits of this new law?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, as the President said when we were going through this process to get health care passed into law, he was going to spend some time going out talking to the American people specifically about the short-term and the long-term benefits that they were going to get out of it.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what you see.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow the President will be in Maine where he\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking about some of the benefits that small businesses will get in the short term and the long term as it relates to health care.</p>\n<p>So you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the President travel and talk about it.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll see members of the administration talking about it.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make sure the American people know exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s in this bill for them and when it comes into effect.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, I want to revisit a health care issue from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Regarding the write-downs for big companies like AT&amp;T, Caterpillar, I\xe2\x80\x99m unclear -- is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position that these write-downs are purely political; that they could have been done in a more gradual way?\xc2\xa0 Or is it the position that, yes, their hands are tied by accounting rules and they had to take these write-downs immediately?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make a statement on the motivations of people announcing what 30-year projections are saying about the impact that health care reform will have on their business.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view that all the benefits in health care reform will have a much greater positive impact on those businesses than the loss of a double subsidy will to their business.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You seem to be scoffing at a breakdown over 30 years.\xc2\xa0 Is that true that you\xe2\x80\x99re saying this --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not scoffing at it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just pointing it out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and secondly -- it sounded like scoffing.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, I sent you a high-priority email yesterday -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw it -- but I was questioning the reading habits of Mr. Gibbs.\xc2\xa0 Has Mr. Gibbs actually read all the reports he cited yesterday to justify -- to claim that there will a bending of the cost curve in the health care bill?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I assume that he has, because he\xe2\x80\x99s a really fast reader and he\xe2\x80\x99s been very interested in the subject.\xc2\xa0 But the good news for you is that I\xe2\x80\x99m just doing this part-time, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have your chance to ask him directly.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that his proposal today will make it easier to raise the cap and trade bill and actually get it debated in the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that what he did today is an important part of moving it forward.\xc2\xa0 And so the President has been --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\'m asking about the politics.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 And I know that here in Washington -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been here that long, but I know that everything is viewed through a lens of who does this help, who does this hurt, who\xe2\x80\x99s up, who\xe2\x80\x99s down.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that this is the best policy, and that working with members of the Senate on both sides -- the Republicans and the Democrats -- this is policy -- that there are things that people of both political persuasions can agree to and we can move forward on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Presumably you\xe2\x80\x99ve also been here long enough to know that that\xe2\x80\x99s the way they think inside, too.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go that far.\xc2\xa0 Having talked to the folks who I work with here in the West Wing all day today, I know that there is a real belief that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed today doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just follow through on what the President promised on the campaign for the sake of following through on it.\xc2\xa0 It also would put our country on a new track towards more domestic production of energy, towards more renewable energy use, and towards creating jobs of the future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to set deadlines for other legislation, will you set a deadline for getting cap and trade passed?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a deadline for you today.\xc2\xa0 I just know the President wants to move forward on this as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Savannah.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that you guys haven\xe2\x80\x99t considered the politics at all with this, is it possible there was a strategic blunder here by conceding so much -- doing offshore drilling, you\xe2\x80\x99ve announced new grants for nuclear reactors -- without getting any concessions from Republicans?\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any Republicans standing up there with the President today.\xc2\xa0 Is it possible that you\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of given away the store without any guarantees that you\xe2\x80\x99ll get Republican support in exchange for that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d start by saying that actually Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s spokesperson\xe2\x80\x99s statement was very encouraging, that this was an issue that he had brought up specifically with the President and that we believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to work with Republicans on.\xc2\xa0 But also, like I said, this -- none of this should have been a surprise to anybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about all these different elements for a very long time and the President is following through on promises that he made to have a comprehensive energy strategy.</p>\n<p>So in terms of the politics of this, we think that there are good things in this package that appeal to people of all political persuasions and that in the short term, not the long term, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to move forward and pass some of this into law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, McConnell -- in his statement, which I just read, actually, since you mentioned that, kind of frames it as a small step.\xc2\xa0 All the Republican statements say -- have kind of a lukewarm response to it.\xc2\xa0 Will the President get involved as closely as he was by the end of health care?\xc2\xa0 Did he learn something from the health care debate that he plans to use in this debate?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say for starters I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is anybody who anticipated that the President would roll out an energy plan and people on the Republican side would be cheerleading it right from the get-go.\xc2\xa0 But if you saw what happened over the course of the health care debate, where you had senators saying that this would be the President\xe2\x80\x99s Waterloo, stop this at all costs, this is the way that we can halt the agenda of the President, I think even lukewarm statements are a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, to what extent is the administration joining the chorus of those who chant, \xe2\x80\x9cdrill, baby, drill\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that this comprehensive approach is a lot less \xe2\x80\x9cdrill, baby, drill\xe2\x80\x9d and more \xe2\x80\x9cdrill where it\xe2\x80\x99s responsible, promote efficiency, invest in clean energy, and create jobs of the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I know that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit on a t-shirt quite as well, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more about what President Obama thinks is the right direction for this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it the plan to expand oil and gas leases throughout the Atlantic Ocean?\xc2\xa0 I read a figure of 160 million acres of ocean would be available for new oil and gas drilling.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the specifics on the acreage.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s actually a call happening right now that some of your colleagues are on where they\xe2\x80\x99re going through some of those particulars.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, looking ahead to Friday, the jobs report comes out, as you know, and the President is going to be down in North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 The analysts so far seem to suggest that this will be showing job creation for the second time since the recession started.\xc2\xa0 Does that suggest that the White House will stop now on offering any more jobs plans, or are you going to kind of lay back and let things take hold and see where it goes?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, unless the jobs report comes back and says that we\xe2\x80\x99ve created 8.5 million jobs in this last month, the President is going to treat this jobs report the same way he\xe2\x80\x99s created all the -- he\xe2\x80\x99s treated all the rest of them, which is to say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot more work to do.</p>\n<p>And there\xe2\x80\x99s analysts across the spectrum who have different views of what the jobs report is going to say, and I know there\xe2\x80\x99s different factors that will play into this specific one. Last month there was the huge snowstorm, and this month we might see some of the reverse effects of that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reports that the Census Bureau has hired thousands of folks.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of different factors that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see in this jobs report.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the President is committed to putting the American people back to work and keeping this economy on track.\xc2\xa0 And the jobs report that comes out on Friday is just going to be one set of data, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily going to mean the President is going to change course when it comes to doing everything that he can to move through some of the ideas that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forth on helping small businesses, helping big businesses, helping everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s hiring that he can to create an environment where people can create jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re leaving the door open for another jobs creation package at some point, if needed?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, keep in mind that some of the things that the President has talked about even as recently as December have not come to a vote, haven\xe2\x80\x99t been passed, and so some of his jobs ideas are still out there, including some of the things to -- since this is energy day -- but to make homes more efficient and give people credits to retrofit their own houses and that sort of thing.\xc2\xa0 So the President is still very much focused on creating jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One just minor housekeeping question.\xc2\xa0 Will the First Family\xe2\x80\x99s tax returns be released either Friday or over the weekend?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the timing on that, but they\xe2\x80\x99re generally released and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be out sooner than you think.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a date for you.</p>\n<p>Lester.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 And thank you for your very crisp answers.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that the Holy Father has been fairly treated by The New York Times and The Washington Post?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not something I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to him about.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll see what I can find out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You will?\xc2\xa0 Good.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Why does the President believe that it is fair to bar all private-school children from the Easter Egg Roll, including scholarship students at Sidwell Friends?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the Easter Egg Roll policy, but I would direct you to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s been announced.\xc2\xa0 You must be aware of the announcement.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Like I said, I\xe2\x80\x99m not fully familiar with the Easter Egg Roll policy.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 But you should direct it to the East --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll get me an answer then?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, I would direct you to the East Wing where they know a little more about it.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, today is March 31st, the deadline for the Black Farmers $1.25 [billion] congressional approval for its settlement.\xc2\xa0 Robert was supposed to come back with information about if the President supported an extension -- because we understand that CBC members as well as the Black Farmers were looking for an extension.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any information about the President supports an extension to this deadline after 15 years of their wait?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I checked in with Leg Affairs after you asked that question yesterday, and they told me that they are in fact working with Congress with some urgency to get this done as fast as possible.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any specific timing for you, but this is something that they\xe2\x80\x99re working to make progress on to make sure that we get this done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen today, but you mean that they could possibly use the extension -- I mean, because today is the deadline and they\xe2\x80\x99re not there --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, not knowing the particulars of the specific settlement, I\'m letting you know that the legislative team is working to get this done as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me ask you this as well -- since they have been waiting for 15 years in this Pickford case, the Black Farmers want to know if they can meet with the President, especially after he announced it in his 2011 budget and put out a paper saying he strongly supports it.\xc2\xa0 And they wanted to know if they could sit down and talk to the President to push more so this administration to make it happen, since they\xe2\x80\x99ve waited 15 years.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s a meeting in the works. I can certainly check on it, but I don\'t know if that\'s in the works.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this administration open to meeting with them at least?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t spoken to anybody on that, so I don\'t know.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, you said a couple times already today that the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy is to drill where it\xe2\x80\x99s responsible.\xc2\xa0 So far I\'ve only heard about Virginia.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an idea of other places where the administration believes it\xe2\x80\x99s responsible to drill?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, some of the other areas that were talked about in the reports today are up on the northern coast of Alaska, down in the Gulf region -- areas like that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any plans for drilling off the coast of California?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That is not a part of this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Out of consideration?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak to the entire rest of this administration, but I can tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s energy plan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry if this has already been mentioned, but to what extent was this discussed with Democratic leaders on the Hill before it was rolled out today?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We speak with Democratic leaders on the Hill every day and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They were well aware this was coming?\xc2\xa0 I mean, have you taken the temperature of Democrats on the Hill?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I assume that that has happened.\xc2\xa0 We talk to Democratic leaders every day.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a secret that our energy policy was coming out.\xc2\xa0 Folks got a heads-up that it was happening.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the President has a very close relationship with Speaker Pelosi and Harry Reid and it\xe2\x80\x99s, of course, one of the things that they do talk about from time to time.</p>\n<p>Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the West Coast of Florida, when you\'re talking about the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico -- he says that he would\xc2\xa0 -- if the ban were to be lifted, he\xe2\x80\x99d like to see more exploration there.\xc2\xa0 Will the President ask Congress to lift the ban?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, everyplace has specific regulations that they have to deal with in order to move leases, to actually put in the rigs.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the exploratory phase that they have to go through.\xc2\xa0 So -- what\xe2\x80\x99s your specific question about the Eastern Gulf?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The statement you all put out says that in the Eastern Gulf, which remains under a congressional moratorium -- right?\xc2\xa0 But if it were to be lifted, he thinks there should be more drilling closer to the western coast of Florida.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into water that\xe2\x80\x99s too deep for me when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the Gulf of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I would encourage you to ask the folks at Interior.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, how about -- for years, some of the arguments that opponents of drilling used is that, first of all, as the President said when he was a candidate, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with a single gallon of gas in the short term, it\xe2\x80\x99s way long off; and, number two, that the -- well, answer just that part.\xc2\xa0 When he pounded the lectern back in 2008 and said, I won\xe2\x80\x99t do it because it won\xe2\x80\x99t come up with anything immediate -- what flipped him on that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view -- and I was saying this earlier -- is that this is not a silver bullet to the answer to the energy question that we have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what changed?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s one part.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one part.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that he has said over the course of the campaign.\xc2\xa0 So people who voted for him, people who covered him, people who were watching this election knew that if you pulled the lever for Barack Obama in November of 2008, what you were going to get was a President who, as part of a comprehensive energy strategy, was going to support some drilling where it made sense, was going to promote efficiency, was going to invest in renewables.\xc2\xa0 But he was going to take a comprehensive view, and not just take the short view that drilling was the answer to all of our answers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other aspect of that is the complaint against it was that the drilling -- there are a lot of leases out there sitting there untouched for years.\xc2\xa0 How many leases, and what kind of exploration could go forward that the private companies just aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I actually, Ann, have to say, regret this -- I have the specific numbers for you.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re sitting upstairs on my desk.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be up to see you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 But I will make sure that I get you those numbers -- and anybody else who is interested in them.</p>\n<p>Glen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, in the run-up to Copenhagen, the administration took its share of criticism from conservative groups who said that you were sort of in the pocket of the environmental community.\xc2\xa0 What do you think this says about the President\xe2\x80\x99s attitude towards environmentalists and his willingness to stand up for them even if they don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with him?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- Glen, I was saying this earlier, but I just -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t see it in that political lens necessarily.\xc2\xa0 If the President had done something today that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t promised that he was going to do, that we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t telegraphed from the campaign through the State of the Union of this year, through all the different things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve said about energy, then I would say that maybe we could have a conversation about what this means for standing up to whomever.\xc2\xa0 But this is something the President said he was going to do, and I think that for the most part, people oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t feel surprised about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on what Sam was asking about the contact with the Hill.\xc2\xa0 If you sort of look at this map, it is -- it appears to be carefully crafted and tailored.\xc2\xa0 You have some drilling on the north short of Alaska; you have more restrictions on the south.\xc2\xa0 You also have the drilling off the coast of Virginia.\xc2\xa0 To what extent did you discuss the creation of this map with Senator Warner in Virginia, Senator Landrieu in Louisiana?\xc2\xa0 Was there a back-and-forth prior to this?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 On the actual process for figuring out the places where it made most sense to explore new places to drill I would direct you to the Department of Interior.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about -- yesterday in the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement on Iran with President Sarkozy, he says weeks, not months, on a sanction resolution.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any more understanding of why he\xe2\x80\x99s saying that, or what makes him think he can get it on that time frame?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s happening in terms of the discussions about -- with the Chinese at this point or --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, for starters, as the President expressed yesterday, there\xe2\x80\x99s a real sense of urgency as it relates to working to apply pressure to Iran.\xc2\xa0 And there are some very intense conversations happening at the United Nations right now that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to make some real progress on.\xc2\xa0 And the President feels like we have more support in the international community for sanctions than we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had before and he feels very confident that this spring we will be able to move forward with an agreement of those nations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How important is it to get a sanctions resolution, even if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include everything that he originally might have wanted it to have?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President obviously -- the United States is not the only country who is dealing with this issue.\xc2\xa0 And so we have to work with some of our foreign partners to apply as much pressure as we can.</p>\n<p>You brought up the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 The Chinese know that it\xe2\x80\x99s not in their interest to have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, and we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to work with them to move forward on meaningful pressure on Iran.</p>\n<p>So I would say that the President takes the long view.\xc2\xa0 He wants to apply as much pressure as we can, and he\xe2\x80\x99s confident we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Bill.\xc2\xa0 As you know, gas prices have been on the rise over the past few months.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen $4 a gallon here in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 To what extent does the White House believe that the proposal the President announced today will bring down the cost of gasoline for motorists across the country?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the immediate impact because of course all these different things that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing have to go through different phases, right?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got some places where you can start drilling a lot more soon than in other places.\xc2\xa0 And so the length of time that it takes for the oil to get out of the ground and into the supply is going to take a little while.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not a speculator, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen on the price of a barrel of oil today.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that over the long term this is going to save the American people money, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to allow them to know that our energy future is secure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So long term then -- you say you don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the immediate impact it may have -- long term, you think that the price of gasoline for motorists across the country will come down as a result of the proposal the President announced today?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think that as a result of the proposal the President announced today, our country will have a lot more energy security and a lot less dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the ups and downs of the market, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did that enter into the calculus of the White House in making this decision, that perhaps this would bring down the cost of gasoline for motorists?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously as we get into the summer, gas prices go up.\xc2\xa0 And at a time when the economy is not doing very well, that can have a real pinch on families who are unemployed, or families who are underemployed, or families who are feeling the pinch from all sorts of different aspects of the economy -- rising tuition costs, rising utility costs, and things like that.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nAnd so the President does want to do things that make energy more affordable for the American people.\xc2\xa0 But I would say that this comprehensive approach is the best way to do that for the long term for -- as it relates to energy and as it relates to our economy.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n1:08 P.M.
