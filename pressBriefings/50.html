Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t12:23 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tDarlene, would you like to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Starting with the news that everyone woke up to today. \xc2\xa0What conclusions has the United States government reached about what may have brought down the Egyptian airline?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me start, Darlene, by offering our thoughts and prayers to the families of those who were aboard EgyptAir Flight 804. \xc2\xa0The uncertainty and creeping sense of loss that the loved ones of those who were lost on the plane must be experiencing right now is painful to even contemplate.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, as you all are aware, has received multiple updates from his national security team on the situation. \xc2\xa0U.S. national security and aviation experts have been in touch with their counterparts in France and Egypt to offer assistance. \xc2\xa0Many of you all have probably also seen the announcement from the Department of Defense that the United States Navy is working to deploy a P-3 Orion aircraft to provide support for the search of the missing jetliner.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt this point, Darlene, to go straight to your question, it\'s too early to definitively say what may have caused this disaster. \xc2\xa0The investigation is underway and investigators will consider all of the potential factors that could have contributed to the crash. \xc2\xa0And obviously if there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for the United States government to support those efforts then we will do that. \xc2\xa0And the President asked his team to keep him apprised of developments as they occur.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Switching topics to Puerto Rico and the legislation on the Hill, the agreement on a new bill. \xc2\xa0Is there any reaction from the White House on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the administration has made clear for several months now that any legislation to address the crisis in Puerto Rico must provide a workable and comprehensive restructuring authority with appropriate oversight that respects Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s self-governance. \xc2\xa0We\'re encouraged to see the House introduce legislation yesterday that provides Puerto Rico with these tools to address a crisis that\'s having a negative impact on the 3.5 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico. \xc2\xa0There are tangible, real-world, negative consequences for Americans living in Puerto Rico. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we continue to believe that additional measures are necessary to help Puerto Rico grow its economy and address this humanitarian crisis. \xc2\xa0But the legislation that was unveiled late last night is an important first step. \xc2\xa0We believe that overall the legislation provides a fair process for Puerto Rico to restructure its debts, enact fiscal reforms, and create a foundation for economic recovery after enduring a decade of recession. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s one other thing I\'d like to ask you about. \xc2\xa0The chief of staff to the Hungarian Prime Minister today said that President Obama and the United States favor immigration to Europe because they want to send all the Muslims to Europe. Is there anything you want to say in response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see those comments. \xc2\xa0I\'m not sure they\xe2\x80\x99re worthy of a response. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, is the United States concerned about security at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, and are you concerned about reports that Islamic State militants have infiltrated that airport and others?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jeff, the United States does have a relationship through TSA and DHS with those airports around the world that are the last point of departure to the United States. So the United States has successfully worked with security officials at airports across the country to ensure that international flights arriving in the United States are subject to more exhaustive security and screening procedures to ensure the safety of the American traveling public.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, at this point, it\'s too early to say what potential factors may have contributed to this particular incident. \xc2\xa0But it is fair for you to observe and for the American people to understand that over the last 18 to 24 months, the Department of Homeland Security has made some important enhancements to those international airports that are the last points of departure for international flights. \xc2\xa0And that includes expanded screening that\'s applied to a variety of items that could be transported on an aircraft, so not just carry-on baggage but other baggage and other equipment that is maintained on the aircraft.</p>\n<p>\n\tTSA officials have also engaged in conducting airport assessments in conjunction with our international partners to ensure the security of the terminal and the airport more broadly. And the DHS has worked with partners to offer assistance to certain foreign airports related to broader aviation and airport security questions. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s extensive expertise that exists at TSA, and working with the operators at foreign airports, we\'ve been able to use that expertise to discuss best practices that could be used to enhance security at foreign airports.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have any specific concerns, though, about the Paris airport?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Nothing that I have to articulate from here. \xc2\xa0Obviously there are U.S. flights that originate from that airport and the United States has a very important national security relationship with France and that would extend to our coordination on issues related to aviation security. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t have anything specific to raise in terms of concerns about the security situation in Charles de Gaulle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0More broadly, does the United States have concerns about militants from the Islamic State infiltrating airports, be it in Europe or be it elsewhere in the world?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I would say something that probably is even slightly broader than the way that you asked your question. We have seen a desire on the part of extremists around the world, including some extremists in the Middle East, to carry out attacks targeting the international aviation system, so we obviously are mindful of that. \xc2\xa0And here in the United States we\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced the pain of those aviation-borne attacks firsthand on 9/11. \xc2\xa0So our experts at the TSA take very seriously the need to apply adaptive security measures to ensure the safety of our aviation system. \xc2\xa0They pursue a layered approach that involves a variety of technologies and tactics, and these are tactics that they can be shared with our partners around the world and applied in airports around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously learned a lot since 9/11 about what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to protect the aviation system. \xc2\xa0But that has not diminished the desire of some extremist organizations to try to carry out attacks against the aviation system. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re aware of that, and we are constantly countering that threat by adapting our security system to protect the traveling public.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Finally, you said it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to comment on what the causes were. \xc2\xa0Are you able, or has the U.S. intelligence community been able to rule out anything, such as a bomb? \xc2\xa0Or has anything so far, from the United States\xe2\x80\x99 perspective, been ruled out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any sort of intelligence assessment that has ruled anything out. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m also not aware of any intelligence assessment that\xe2\x80\x99s ruled anything in at this point. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re still quite early in this investigation, and investigators will examine all of the potential factors that may have contributed to this tragedy.</p>\n<p>\n\tToluse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask about Puerto Rico. \xc2\xa0You mentioned that you think there are still more steps that need to be taken in addition to this bill, but as the bill stands now, would you sign it? \xc2\xa0Is this something that the White House supports?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we are encouraged that Democrats and Republicans did work effectively together to produce this piece of legislation. \xc2\xa0Bipartisanship has been hard to come by in the United States Congress for a few years now, so that\xe2\x80\x99s why you heard me describe the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by the introduction of this legislation yesterday. \xc2\xa0So, yes, I think you could say that we are supportive of this legislative proposal to establish a fair process that allows Puerto Rico to restructure its debts, enact fiscal reforms, and create a foundation for economic recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s true, though, is that the introduction of legislation is just the beginning of the process. \xc2\xa0And this crisis in Puerto Rico can only end when Congress takes bipartisan action. \xc2\xa0And we urge members of Congress in both parties to stand firm against the special interests attempting to undermine this essential legislation. \xc2\xa0We urge Congress to act without delay to provide Puerto Rico with the tools that it desperately needs to address a situation that\xe2\x80\x99s having a negative impact on 3.5 million Americans living in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One of the fiscal reforms in the bill includes allowing the governor of Puerto Rico to reduce the minimum wage over five years, below the national average. \xc2\xa0Obviously, that\xe2\x80\x99s something\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t-- the minimum wage is something the administration has pushed for increasing -- there are state increases as high as $15. \xc2\xa0So what\xe2\x80\x99s your response to the idea that Puerto Rico could be reducing its minimum wage less than $7.25?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, my understanding is -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been briefed on this provision -- is that it applies to a particular quirk in the law that actually affects people who are younger than age 20 who are working for the minimum wage and that it would allow their employer to pay them even below the minimum wage.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it would be pretty hard for anybody to explain how exactly a 19-year-old Puerto Rican who\xe2\x80\x99s making minimum wage is somehow responsible for the situation or should be punished as a result of this situation, or that the situation would be improved if 19-year-old Puerto Ricans who are working minimum wage got paid less. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, no, this is not a provision that we support. \xc2\xa0Supporters of this provision I think have a hard time justifying it, but in order to see bipartisan action in Congress, we are prepared to encourage Congress to pass a piece of legislation even if it\xe2\x80\x99s less than perfect.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And it seemed like one of the recent changes was actually increasing the age from 20 to 25. \xc2\xa0That was one of the things that got changed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Exactly. \xc2\xa0And so, yes, are 23-year-old Puerto Ricans who are making minimum wage deserving of a pay cut, and somehow that\xe2\x80\x99s going to improve the economic climate in Puerto Rico? \xc2\xa0Again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen mean-spirited policymaking on the part of Republicans for quite some time now. \xc2\xa0I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll just file this example in a rather large file. \xc2\xa0But the President has made assisting Puerto Rico and addressing their challenging economic situation a top priority, and sometimes getting bipartisan progress in Congress requires supporting legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s not perfect. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, back on the plane. \xc2\xa0Can you say whether and with what frequency the expanded screenings have resulted in thwarted plots against Americans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an assessment of that. \xc2\xa0These expanded screenings, just to be clear, are applied to international aircraft that are bound for the United States. \xc2\xa0Obviously, EgyptAir Flight 804 took off from Paris and was bound from Cairo, so it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t subjected necessarily to these specific enhanced screening. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I understand.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an assessment for how those enhanced security measures have disrupted plots, but we do believe that expertise from the TSA and additional screening measures even at foreign airports does enhance the safety and security of Americans traveling abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Two more. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to keep them short. \xc2\xa0You said that investigators would look at all factors. \xc2\xa0Did you mean U.S. investigators? \xc2\xa0And if so, why are they involved at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say U.S. investigators.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I have indicated -- and I think that this was part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s instruction -- is that U.S. officials, both national security officials and aviation experts, would be in touch with their counterparts and offering assistance. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that that assistance has been accepted at this point, but certainly U.S. officials, including officials who could assist in the investigation of an aviation disaster, could be made available if requested.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0When you were asked whether you had specific concerns about Charles De Gaulle Airport, you said nothing you can articulate from there. \xc2\xa0That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound terrifically reassuring. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is I can\xe2\x80\x99t offer a security assessment of any airport around the world, so I certainly would encourage you guys to check with TSA on that. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s no specific concern that\xe2\x80\x99s been raised that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0You said that it\xe2\x80\x99s too early, of course, to really know what happened. \xc2\xa0But even at this point, and even hours ago, Egyptian officials were saying that terrorism in this case is more likely than a technical fault on this plane. \xc2\xa0Does the administration share that view? \xc2\xa0Or does the U.S. have information that backs that likelihood up, at the very least?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, the information that is available is something that investigators are still taking a close look at and so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hazard a guess at this point about what factors may have potentially contributed to this disaster. \xc2\xa0But obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take a close look at all the available evidence and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be in close touch with our counterparts, and if there is assistance that U.S. experts or U.S. national security officials can provide in the investigation, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So when Egyptian officials are saying it\xe2\x80\x99s likely terrorism, and other officials are speculating that, based on what we know happened, it looks like a bomb, is that something that is taken into account? \xc2\xa0I mean, do you feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s premature to make those assessments right now? \xc2\xa0Or is the U.S. looking at those assessments from other countries?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, right now, what the United States is doing is offering our assistance to those investigators who are taking a look at this information and trying to draw conclusions as best they can. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a separate assessment to share from here. \xc2\xa0But we obviously want to be supportive of those who are conducting this investigation, and the deployment of a U.S. Navy aircraft to assist in the search is one tangible example of how U.S. assets can be used to benefit the ongoing effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But by saying it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to really know, you\xe2\x80\x99re not, by saying that, dismissing those early assessments?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I\xe2\x80\x99m merely explaining why I don\xe2\x80\x99t have my own assessment to offer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And because it is a question mark and because those assessments at this point are coming from elsewhere and this originated at an airport where flights to the U.S. originate, on its face, does this, at this point, raise the risk for U.S. passengers?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to reach that conclusion. \xc2\xa0Obviously national security officials at the Department of Homeland Security and the TSA can offer up the best assessment about that. \xc2\xa0As I was explaining to Olivier, flights that originate from Charles De Gaulle that are bound for the United States are subjected to additional screening that may not have applied in this situation. \xc2\xa0So American passengers can certainly take some confidence from that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, we\xe2\x80\x99re only hours, not even days, into trying to get to the bottom of what exactly happened here. \xc2\xa0So we obviously are going to be very supportive of those who are conducting the investigation, and we are eager to understand exactly what may have contributed to this particular tragedy. \xc2\xa0And if it merits any sort of change in our security posture, then I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that\xe2\x80\x99s something that will be carefully evaluated by DHS Secretary Johnson and TSA Administrator Neffenger to make the appropriate changes if necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And because we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened here and terrorism is a possibility, can you just sort of broadly describe the kinds of additional measures that are going on in foreign airports by the TSA right now? \xc2\xa0I mean, can you say that this is something of an internal alert? \xc2\xa0Or because there are expanded measures already, are they now tighter immediately? \xc2\xa0I mean, what can you say about what happens after something like this has transpired?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what happens immediately when something like this transpires is that there is work -- well, that there are offers of assistance that are made to the investigators overseas that are conducting the investigation. \xc2\xa0And the United States has expertise and assets that other investigators may find useful. \xc2\xa0They certainly have been useful in other international investigations that have been conducted.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there are a number of things that the TSA is engaged in, regardless of whether or not there is an unexplained crash like this one. \xc2\xa0So let me give you a couple more examples. \xc2\xa0In the fiscal year 2015, the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s transportation security specialists performed 289 air carrier inspections and 146 foreign airport assessments. \xc2\xa0So, again, this is an example of how expertise at the TSA can be deployed overseas to enhance not just the U.S. aviation system but the international aviation system.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that the TSA often does is they will deploy canine teams in airports, including teams that are sometimes led by state and local law enforcement as well as by TSA officers themselves. \xc2\xa0These teams operate in secure areas of the airport, including activities such as screening cargo and baggage as it\xe2\x80\x99s being loaded into the aircraft.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that DHS has been able to do is to establish something called preclearance. \xc2\xa0And there are a handful of airports around the world where international flights will originate and fly into the United States. \xc2\xa0And preclearance means that Customs and Border Patrol officers don\xe2\x80\x99t screen the passengers after they get off the plane but actually will engage in screening those passengers overseas on foreign soil before they even board a plane that is bound for the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that means that the security of those flights is enhanced even further than they already would be. \xc2\xa0And there are 15 preclearance locations around the world right now, and DHS and CVP are working together to try to expand that program and, again, provide greater confidence that air passengers who are boarding flights bound for the United States have actually been thoroughly reviewed by U.S. national security professionals before they even board the plane.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does TSA have any involvement in the maintenance of planes and how those procedures are done before that plane takes off?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware that TSA has a maintenance function, but TSA can certainly provide assistance and advice to foreign airport officials as they try to secure sensitive parts of the airport. \xc2\xa0So that could include terminals, but that could also include sensitive maintenance areas. \xc2\xa0So while they\'re not, firsthand, involved in conducting that maintenance, they can certainly offer advice and assistance in terms of helping airport officials secure those sensitive parts of the airport.</p>\n<p>\n\tJuliet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Continuing on the theme of bipartisan agreement on legislation, today a group of Republican and Senate Democrats have unveiled a bill to overhaul the decades-old Toxic Substances Control Act -- a chemical bill that is something the White House and EPA have been consulting on. \xc2\xa0Can you say at this point if the White House endorses this proposal, which has received considerable support from both parties in the Senate and, to a lesser degree, in the House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have to check with our team to see to what extent we\'ve been briefed on the details of the proposals that\'s apparently been agreed to. \xc2\xa0So let me circle back with you on the details of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m just trying to understand the investigative cooperation relationship between the U.S. and, say, the Egyptian and French and other authorities. \xc2\xa0Because you said that there have been offers of assistance and that so far they have not been accepted. \xc2\xa0Yet, at the same time, there\'s every -- well, there are some indications that this could be a terrorist attack, and this is obviously a big concern for the United States. \xc2\xa0So what you\'ve described sounds more passive than active and aggressive and engaged. \xc2\xa0Do you see what I\'m saying? \xc2\xa0And I\'m just trying to understand why that is. \xc2\xa0Why is the United States not just -- why isn\xe2\x80\x99t there some sort of mechanism whereby because of -- again, there\'s been so much emphasis on intelligence-sharing and the fight against ISIS. \xc2\xa0Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t there some sort of mechanism or some sort of process whereby, given the work that TSA has done in these airports, that there\'s a much more aggressive and engaged posture by the United States when something like this happens?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Ron, I think the first thing that we should step back and recognize is that this is an aircraft that did not originate on American soil. \xc2\xa0It was not bound for American soil; it was not an American airline. \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware that the pilots were American. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the plane didn\xe2\x80\x99t crash in America. \xc2\xa0So there are other countries that have appropriate jurisdictions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the United States has important relationships with both France and with Egypt. \xc2\xa0We\'ve got an important relationship with Greek authorities, who had launched the preliminary search effort because this obviously took place near Greek waters. \xc2\xa0So there are reasons why there are other countries who were immediately responsible for dealing with this situation, but that has not at all resulted in a delay of the United States offering assistance, communicating with our partners in both of the countries, and being engaged in trying to get to the bottom of what exactly transpired.</p>\n<p>\n\tI did not mean to lead you to conclude that somehow our offers of assistance had been rebuffed, just that other countries have the lead. \xc2\xa0We have offered to help and we stand ready to provide that assistance as soon as they\'re ready to integrate it into their efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So what if it\'s not accepted? \xc2\xa0Is this diplomatic language that you can\'t say --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Given the strong relationships between the United States and France, and the United States and Egypt, I\'m confident that we\'ll be able to provide them the needed support to ensure that this investigation proceeds expeditiously and is conducted with a focus on getting to the bottom of what exactly transpired so that we can make any necessary changes -- whether that\'s changes to an aircraft, enhancements to maintenance, or taking additional security precautions to ensure the safety and security of the traveling public.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0Because, again, even though this does not involve an American plane or passengers or a pilot or airports, the international air system is essentially -- it\'s an international system. \xc2\xa0It\'s really not -- I mean, obviously it\'s not a state-separated system. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why -- again, so you have every expectation that the -- so at this moment, the FBI, the TSA, others are not actively involved in this investigation? They are essentially -- have extended an offer, and now some 12 or more hours after this happened, we\'re still waiting to hear whether or not they will be engaged and involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I would encourage you to consult with those individual agencies, and they can detail for you the kinds of conversations that they\'ve had with our partners. \xc2\xa0But I have confidence that France and Egypt will seek whatever assistance is required, and the United States stands ready to provide as much assistance as is necessary to achieve our shared goal, which is to get to the bottom of what happened as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I want to ask you questions on two different subjects. \xc2\xa0One, starting off with the airports and this crash, or this possible or alleged terrorist attack. \xc2\xa0What is the, I guess, conversations, and is there some line of conversation between the FAA here, intelligence officials, and their counterparts in other nations when it comes to airports and airlines? \xc2\xa0Because that is still considered the number-one target for terrorists, in airports. \xc2\xa0What kind of conversations are happening? \xc2\xa0And particularly when it comes to the uniformity in stepping up security in all of these airports around the country -- because every airport is different. \xc2\xa0Security in every airport is different.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, April, the priority that we have placed is on those airports overseas that are the last point of departure. \xc2\xa0So international aircraft that originate in other countries flying into the United States, those are, for obvious reasons, the point of emphasis that our security professionals have identified. \xc2\xa0And as a result, there are enhanced screening measures in place at airports around the world -- not on American soil -- but that are consistent with established standards put together by TSA to ensure the safety of flights bound for the United States that originate in other countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to that, TSA obviously has experts and equipment and strategies for safeguarding aircraft, for safeguarding passengers, for safeguarding airports. \xc2\xa0And that assistance advice about that expertise is provided to our partners around the world. \xc2\xa0As I pointed out, in the last fiscal year, TSA security specialists performed 289 air carrier inspections and 146 foreign airport assessments. \xc2\xa0So I think that\'s an indication that the scope of their work is quite broad.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in addition to that, the Department of Homeland Security has sought to expand their preclearance program that provides significantly enhanced screening of passengers who are originating -- who are trying to travel to the United States from overseas. \xc2\xa0And examining the passports and documentation of those passengers before they ever board the plane, ensuring that those aircraft and those passengers can be swept prior to boarding the plane consistent with U.S. standards is certainly another way that we can enhance the safety of the American traveling public.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo DHS and TSA and CVP and all of these national security agencies that have different responsibilities for protecting the American people are not just actively engaged in the United States in protecting the traveling public, but they\xe2\x80\x99re actively engaged overseas to ensure that international flights arriving in the United States are secure as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What I\'m getting from what you\'re saying is there\xe2\x80\x99s not uniformity but there\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to increase and enhance it. \xc2\xa0So with that, what\xe2\x80\x99s the reality in the timeline that there could be uniformity in these airports where everyone is on the same page with documentation, screenings, et cetera?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, April, I don\'t envision a scenario in which every single airport in the world has the same security screening measures.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m asking about the airports that -- as you say, there are efforts that you\'re making when it comes to security more so with the airports that have flights coming into the United States. \xc2\xa0When will there be -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the timeline for that uniformity as far as screenings and documentations, things of that nature?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Flights that are the last point of departure are subject to enhanced screening measures that are applied by TSA. \xc2\xa0So does that answer your question?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what I would do is this. \xc2\xa0I think you should check with TSA and they can provide you a more detailed assessment of what security measures they have in place at airports around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Make sure TSA and I can talk? \xc2\xa0Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Anybody else?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m not finished with my other question -- I\'m sorry. \xc2\xa0It was the Nigerian girls since we had the latest news yesterday. Could you talk to us about any intelligence you\xe2\x80\x99ve received? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the latest as relates to the Nigerian girls?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0AS you know, April, extensive resources have been provided by the United States to the Nigerian officials who are responsible for searching not just for the Chibok girls but for the thousands of Nigerians who have been kidnapped by Boko Haram. \xc2\xa0Boko Haram is a vicious terrorist organization that has capitalized on kidnapping to try to raise money for their terrorist organization and to otherwise terrorize the people in that country and the people in that region. \xc2\xa0And the United States has provided intelligence, military and financial support to the Nigerian government as they confront this threat. \xc2\xa0And we continue to provide that even to this day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And was that a glimmer of hope yesterday that even though she was found pregnant and they were questioning if that could have been one of the captors -- it was supposed to be her husband -- is there still a glimmer of hope that more will be found?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Certainly the United States continues to vigorously support the efforts of the Nigerian government. \xc2\xa0Ultimately, it\'s the Nigerian government who is responsible for conducting the search, and their search efforts have been enhanced greatly by the assistance provided by the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Two Chinese tactical jets have intercepted an American reconnaissance plane in the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0And I was wondering, how seriously are you taking this incident? \xc2\xa0Do you see it as a provocation? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Andrew, the Department of Defense is reviewing public claims of a May 17 intercept of a U.S. maritime patrol reconnaissance aircraft by two tactical aircraft from the People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of China. \xc2\xa0The incident occurred in international airspace during a routine U.S. patrol in the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0Initial reports of the incident characterized it as \xe2\x80\x9cunsafe.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI can tell you more generally that the Department of Defense has made progress reducing the risk between U.S. operational forces and those of the People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of China. \xc2\xa0We\'ve reduced that risk by improving dialogue at multiple levels under the bilateral confidence-building measures and the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement. \xc2\xa0These are established diplomatic and military channels that allow the United States and China to communicate clearly and raise concerns about these kinds of issues when they arise.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m told that the next Military Maritime Consultative Agreement talks are actually scheduled for May 24 and 25 in Hawaii. \xc2\xa0So there is a well-established diplomatic and military channel to work through these kinds of concerns. \xc2\xa0Over the course of the last year, the Department of Defense has seen improvements in the way that Chinese military pilots fly consistent with international guidelines and consistent with the way that aircraft can be operated in a safe and professional manner. \xc2\xa0But suffice it to say that the Department of Defense is addressing this issue through the appropriate channels.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the President typically told about these incidents, or this one in particular?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President is certainly apprised of these developments as warranted. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know whether or not he received a specific briefing on this particular situation. \xc2\xa0Again, based on the kinds of improvements that we\'ve seen over the last year, I think these kinds of incidents are not common. \xc2\xa0But there also was a pretty significant incident in the first few months of the Bush administration with Chinese military aircraft intercepting U.S. intelligence aircraft that resulted in a much more significant geopolitical incident. \xc2\xa0The reports of this incident obviously didn\xe2\x80\x99t result in the same kind of consequences.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This is obviously not an accident. \xc2\xa0Do you think that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to coincide with the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Vietnam?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to address this issue through the established channels. \xc2\xa0And presumably, in those channels, Chinese officials can explain their perspective on what exactly occurred. \xc2\xa0But I would hesitate to ascribe a motive at this point. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty restrained in how you\xe2\x80\x99ve described what has happened with the EgyptAir flight. \xc2\xa0Donald Trump was out with a tweet this morning -- he says, \xe2\x80\x9cLooks like another terrorist attack. \xc2\xa0Airplane departed from Paris. \xc2\xa0When will we get tough, smart and vigilant?\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0That would imply that this administration has not done those things in terms of being \xe2\x80\x9ctough, smart and vigilant.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0What do you make of those comments? \xc2\xa0Inappropriate at this time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific reaction to that tweet. \xc2\xa0Obviously we believe that this investigation should move forward, and move forward expeditiously. \xc2\xa0And if conclusions point toward specific security concerns, then I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that our security professionals will address it.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut since you, or someone else, brought it up, my colleagues at the Department of Defense did provide I think a pretty useful update on some of the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria in recent weeks. \xc2\xa0So let me just point out a couple of the highlights.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first is that we obviously are pleased with the progress that Iraqi security forces have made in the western Anbar town of Rutbah. \xc2\xa0This operation, once it\xe2\x80\x99s complete, will help the Iraqis reclaim Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s southwestern border and reestablish economic trade along highways between Jordan and Iraq. \xc2\xa0We obviously have been supportive of Iraqi forces that are operating in that area, and we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to see them make important progress. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI also have an updated assessment for you in terms of the success that Iraqi forces have had in driving ISIL out of populated territory in Iraq. \xc2\xa0The updated assessment is that now 45 percent of the populated area that ISIL previously controlled has been retaken from them. \xc2\xa0In Syria, that figure is now 20 percent, thanks to the work of local partners, including the Syrian-Arab coalition. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an increase in both countries. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition, there are some additional metrics I can share with you here. \xc2\xa0DOD has indicated they have targeted and killed more than 120 high-value individuals in ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s attack network, including leaders, facilitators, planners and recruiters. \xc2\xa0And my colleagues at the Department of Defense have indicated that that\xe2\x80\x99s had a measurable impact on ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe coalition more broadly has trained more than 30,000 Iraqi security forces. \xc2\xa0They reported that, right now, nearly 5,000 Iraqi security forces are in training. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s about 3,800 Iraqi army soldiers and about 1,100 Peshmerga fighters in Erbil. \xc2\xa0Together, that is the highest number the coalition has been training at any one point in time. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then finally, I want to draw to your attention an announcement that was made today by the International Monetary Fund. \xc2\xa0They announced that they had come to an agreement with the government of Iraq on a $5 billion loan agreement over the next three years. \xc2\xa0Over the last several weeks, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talking with a greater sense of urgency about the economic situation in Iraq, and obviously the security challenges in Iraq combined with some of the challenges that they\xe2\x80\x99ve encountered in implementing political reforms, as well as the impact of a much lower global price of oil -- all have combined to have a negative impact on the economic situation in Iraq. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President made a concerted effort to encourage our partners and allies who are part of the coalition to ramp up the financial assistance that they\xe2\x80\x99re providing to Iraq, both to offer support to the Abadi government, but also to offer support to the Iraqi government as they try to rebuild those areas that have been retaken from ISIL. \xc2\xa0We know that some of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s tactics have been to essentially destroy the infrastructure of places that they had occupied.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo being able to quickly rebuild that infrastructure and allow people to move home is a top priority of the Abadi government and will be critical to the success of stabilizing and securing the country. \xc2\xa0And the international contribution to this effort is critical. \xc2\xa0And obviously, a $5.4 billion commitment from the IMF is significant. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo thank you for indulging me on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, ISIS hasn\xe2\x80\x99t claimed responsibility. \xc2\xa0Is there a reason you brought them up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, but I think that was implied in the tweet. \xc2\xa0And you had asked whether or not we had been vigorous in pursuing extremist organizations that have vowed to attack the United States, or at least our interests. \xc2\xa0And so it seemed appropriate to offer an update to our efforts against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lisa Monaco delivered the briefing this morning, I believe, to the President, according to your readout. \xc2\xa0Is that the U.S. official who has continued to update the President? \xc2\xa0Or are there others from different departments?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0She will continue to be principally responsible for that, but obviously there are other officials, including in the intelligence community and other places, that may also have information to share with the President. \xc2\xa0But she obviously is the person responsible for that, principally.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Given her role in counterterrorism, it would imply that that is obviously a key concern when it comes to this EgyptAir crash, or disappearance, I suppose. \xc2\xa0Is that a fair thing to surmise?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, she is both the President\xe2\x80\x99s top counterterrorism advisor but also his top homeland security advisor, so it\xe2\x80\x99s also customary for her to apprise him of events that could have a potential impact on the homeland, even if they\xe2\x80\x99re not related to terrorism.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But is this being treated, I guess, like any other plane downing or disappearance? \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a few in the past few years. \xc2\xa0I mean, is there something specific about this focus and how quickly the administration has responded -- about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the response that we have initiated here at the White House is consistent with any significant or potentially significant world event that could have an impact on U.S. policy. \xc2\xa0And certainly Ms. Monaco and her colleagues at the NSC have been conscientious about making sure the President has all of the information that he needs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So in public discourse about this, do you think that terrorism is being too focused on? \xc2\xa0Or are we -- you\xe2\x80\x99re getting a lot of questions in this room specifically about that as a hypothesis that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been ruled out. \xc2\xa0But is that the prime focus right now, ruling that out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that our intelligence community has concluded that that\xe2\x80\x99s the prime focus at this point. \xc2\xa0But look, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to second-guess the questions that independent journalists choose to ask.</p>\n<p>\n\tKaren.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said today on TV that politics is the reason that the United States is not defining the mission in Iraq as a combat mission. \xc2\xa0He says he believes it is. \xc2\xa0He says it\xe2\x80\x99s a disservice to those out there putting their lives on the line, and \xe2\x80\x9cincredibly unfortunate not to speak openly about what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Is Secretary Gates wrong?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Karen, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity to discuss this on a number of occasions from here. \xc2\xa0But I know that people like General Dunford and Secretary Carter have also had an opportunity to discuss this. \xc2\xa0The fact of the matter is we have worked very diligently to try to be as clear as possible about what mission our men and women in uniform have been given by the Commander-in-Chief in Iraq and in Syria. \xc2\xa0And the mission that they have been given and the responsibility that they are bearing is significant and dangerous. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of anybody in the administration who has sought to downplay that.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we have tried to do is to be as precise as possible in describing what exactly their mission is. \xc2\xa0And while their presence in Iraq and in Syria is dangerous and, on occasion, our men and women in uniform have found themselves in combat situations that are dangerous, they have not been deployed to Iraq to wage combat on the ground against ISIL. \xc2\xa0Their responsibility, their mission has been to offer training, advice, and assistance to Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, of course, there are some U.S. Special Operators that have been deployed to carry out raids against ISIL targets. \xc2\xa0Obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s a combat situation. \xc2\xa0But that is very different than the decision that was made by President Bush to deploy more than 100,000 U.S. forces on the ground in a sustained combat role where their principal responsibility was to seek out and engage the adversary in combat. \xc2\xa0The mission that has been given to U.S. forces is different. \xc2\xa0And we have gone to great lengths to try to help you and the American public understand with precision exactly what responsibilities the Commander-in-Chief has given them.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason that that precision is important is it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand the different in approach, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also important for people to understand how much gratitude we should have for our men and women in uniform who are assuming a great burden, at great peril to themselves, to keep our country safe. \xc2\xa0Certainly the Commander-in-Chief has that gratitude, and hopefully every American does.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty tough charge, though, using the word \xe2\x80\x9cpolitics\xe2\x80\x9d in this. \xc2\xa0Can you specifically respond to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to respond to Secretary Gates today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, back on the Chinese aircraft incident. \xc2\xa0You said you would not ascribe a motive to that incident. \xc2\xa0But is there any doubt in the administration\xe2\x80\x99s mind that the incident was deliberate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think this is exactly why we\xe2\x80\x99ve got this established channel where U.S. military and diplomatic officials can consult with their counterparts in China and engage in a dialogue with them about this particular incident and give those Chinese officials an opportunity to explain from their perspective exactly what happened and try to prevent those kinds of dangerous incidents from occurring in the future. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m hesitating to ascribe a motive. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Chinese officials explain their actions, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that they\xe2\x80\x99ll do that both publicly and privately.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could you say whether this is the kind of incident President Obama would raise in his next conversation with President Xi?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it necessarily would rise to that level. \xc2\xa0There have been a couple of high-profile incidents with --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Russians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST \xc2\xa0 -- the Russians. \xc2\xa0And the President, in the immediate aftermath of one of those incidents, had a long phone call with President Putin and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this kind of incident would rise to that level. \xc2\xa0It certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rise to the level of prompting proactively a call from the President to his Chinese counterpart, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to say whether or not it would come up in a call that was scheduled to discuss something else. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0Can you say whether or not Chinese leaders have raised the issue of U.S. reconnaissance planes near their airspace operating in that area?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the concern that they have raised is about the kind of territorial disputes that have arisen in the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0And China makes some significant claims in that region of the world that are in dispute. \xc2\xa0And the United States has asserted that those disputes should be resolved through diplomacy. \xc2\xa0We\'ve made clear both publicly and privately that the United States is not a claimant to any of those land features in the South China Sea, but we have encouraged those with competing claims, including China, to find a diplomatic resolution to those competing claims.</p>\n<p>\n\tTaka.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Former U.S. Marine working for the U.S. military base Kadena in Okinawa was arrested by Okinawa police after a Japanese woman\'s body was found. \xc2\xa0Are you concerned this incident will make worse relations between people in Okinawa and U.S. military base? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Taka, we\'ve seen the reports and we\'re aware of the arrest of a U.S. citizen civilian in Okinawa, and we\'re following the case closely. \xc2\xa0You probably have seen the statement from Ambassador Kennedy on this issue. \xc2\xa0Our heartfelt sympathy and deepest condolences go out to the family and friends of the victim. \xc2\xa0This is a terrible tragedy and an outrage, and we wish to express our deepest sorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States is treating this situation with the utmost seriousness, and the United States military is cooperating fully with local authorities in their investigation. \xc2\xa0For additional details about that, I\'d refer you to the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0They presumably could answer any questions you would have about any impact this could potentially have on the military presence in Okinawa, but I would not anticipate any sort of policy change.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President is going to Japan next week, so will he talk about these kinds of issues?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m sorry? \xc2\xa0He\'ll go to Japan next week. \xc2\xa0And what was the last part of your questions?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will he talk about these issues when he goes to Japan? \xc2\xa0Will he talk about this military base issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the conversation about this particular incident will occur. \xc2\xa0I would anticipate the President will have an opportunity to have a discussion with Prime Minister Abe, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not this will be on the agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tDave.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0On TPP, the ITC report came out late yesterday and it showed in their assessment that the TPP would boost American agriculture, boost the service sector, but actually have a slightly downward impact on U.S. manufacturing. \xc2\xa0Obviously, manufacturing has been a big selling point for the President in this, and this is showing that it would actually reduce manufacturing slightly. \xc2\xa0Is that a disappointment to you? \xc2\xa0Or do you agree with that assessment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me say a couple of things. \xc2\xa0I mean, the overall numbers are, as you point out, quite good. \xc2\xa0The U.S. annual real income would be boosted by $57 billion if TPP were to go into effect based on this independent analysis. \xc2\xa0And about two-thirds -- GDP would increase $42 billion. \xc2\xa0And about two-thirds of the GDP growth resulting from the TPP would go to American workers through wage increases and increased job opportunities. \xc2\xa0And that\'s how -- I think this provides additional evidence of how the TPP is consistent with the President\'s strategy of focusing on growing the U.S. economy from the middle out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would say that these numbers would be even higher if they factored in the important success that we have enjoyed in negotiating a reduction in non-tariff barriers in the TPP agreement. \xc2\xa0This independent analysis did not fully account for the impact of the reduction in non-tariff barriers. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the manufacturing sectors, the report shows very clearly that, under TPP, manufacturing employment and output do not decline from where they are now, but they would grow. \xc2\xa0And the ITC says very clearly that output in employment in each of the 56 sectors that they model will rise with TPP in effect. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me give you a couple of examples. \xc2\xa0The fact that -- the ITC report shows that nearly $2 billion in increased auto exports is evidence of the impact of reducing the 70 percent tax that Vietnam currently imposes on American automobiles. \xc2\xa0Malaysia imposes a 30 percent tax. \xc2\xa0And the reduction in those taxes would have a positive impact on U.S. workers and auto companies here at home.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say about this is just that I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to consider also that the ITC report didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- conducted their analysis essentially in isolation. \xc2\xa0Their analysis compares TPP to a baseline in which everything remains the same. \xc2\xa0One of our most powerful arguments, I think, about the need to move forward with implementing the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement is that if we do not, then China will certainly look to capitalize on opportunities in Southeast Asia that would not just preserve the status quo, but actually put American businesses at a further disadvantage.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the question right now is not whether or not we should protect the status quo -- which many critics of the TPP are concerned about -- but rather, whether the United States would benefit from deeper engagement in the region and a trade agreement like the TPP that would raise labor standards, raise environmental standards, and raise human rights standards. \xc2\xa0Or are we going to subject U.S. businesses and U.S. workers to further disadvantage by effectively retreating from that region of the world?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Obviously your opponents, including Democrats in Congress, have been saying this would be bad for manufacturing. \xc2\xa0Are you concerned that this newer port will give them even more ammunition and decrease the likelihood that Congress will take this up this year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not. \xc2\xa0Again, I think they would be challenged to make the case that the U.S. auto industry, for example, would be negatively affected by cutting the 70 percent tax that Vietnam currently imposes on American autos. \xc2\xa0I also think they\xe2\x80\x99d be challenged to make an argument that, given the status quo that they claim to be concerned about, that we should try to preserve it and not implement the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. \xc2\xa0Because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t really heard them articulate a strategy for dealing with our increasingly globalized 21st century economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, what\xe2\x80\x99s likely to happen if the United States withdraws from this region of the world -- we will see China seek to expand its influence. \xc2\xa0They won\xe2\x80\x99t be looking to raise environmental labor and human rights standards. \xc2\xa0If anything, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking to reduce them. \xc2\xa0That will put U.S. businesses and U.S. workers and the U.S. economy at a further disadvantage. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of the case that we have made about the wisdom of moving forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One other thing. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve now had a full 24 hours to study the list of Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s potential Supreme Court nominees. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Anything else you\xe2\x80\x99d like to add about them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You won\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to hear that I have not devoted a single second of the last 24 hours to doing that. \xc2\xa0Plenty of others have and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them weigh in with their opinions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Has the President reached out or spoken to President Sisi or Hollande?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not at this point. \xc2\xa0But if a contact like that occurs we\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And should we or should we not expect him to make an on-camera statement or comment about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Should we or should we not expect the President at some point to address the Puerto Rican people directly or visit the island?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any presidential plans to visit the island, but if that changes we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure -- we would make accommodations for you to join as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would there be any interest in doing that, though? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President did have the opportunity to campaign in Puerto Rico in 2008. \xc2\xa0I had the pleasure of joining him on that trip. \xc2\xa0It was actually about this time of year eight years ago. \xc2\xa0Seems like a long time ago now. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But given the economic crisis there, it would seem to be of interest to the President, certainly the Puerto Rican people, that he make a direct appeal, especially if this makes its way through Congress and something gets signed.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a trip right now to tell you about. \xc2\xa0Obviously Secretary Lew traveled to the island within the last couple of weeks. \xc2\xa0I understand that Secretary Castro is there this week, I believe -- is that right? \xc2\xa0So Secretary Castro is there this week. \xc2\xa0So there certainly have been a number of Obama administration officials, Cabinet-level officials who have visited Puerto Rico just within the last couple of weeks, to see firsthand the impact of the financial crisis on the island, on the livelihood of the 3 million Americans who live there. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President and the senior officials who are responsible for the domestic economy are quite concerned about the situation there. \xc2\xa0After all, that\xe2\x80\x99s why the administration put forward a plan back in October to try to address this situation, and ever since then, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to get Republicans to engage in a good-faith conversation about addressing the situation. \xc2\xa0We obviously were pleased that that lengthy process resulted in the introduction of bipartisan legislation last night.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It would be, by the way, the 40th bipartisan piece of legislation signed by the President this year. \xc2\xa0Were you aware of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, unfortunately, we\xe2\x80\x99re a long way from getting it signed. \xc2\xa0We certainly would like to see Congress act expeditiously to get this to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me circle back on something Karen asked you about, what former Secretary Gates had to say. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s been relatively consistent in his criticism of this notion that if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it\xe2\x80\x99s a duck. \xc2\xa0It is combat by any definition. \xc2\xa0Today you said you wanted to make certain that the American people understood the difference between having a combat mission and being engaged in combat. \xc2\xa0I want to give you another run at that, and I want to understand specifically, are you suggesting that unless they\xe2\x80\x99re on a combat mission, they are not in combat? \xc2\xa0Or are you saying even the ones who are not on a combat mission are engaged, in fact, in combat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to do, Kevin, is explain to the American people and to your viewers exactly what mission our men and women in uniform have been given by their Commander-in-Chief. \xc2\xa0I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to first recognize is that the mission that our men and women in uniform have been given by President Obama is quite different than the mission that more than 100,000 U.S. servicemembers received from President Bush in the invasion of Iraq in 2003. \xc2\xa0That was a ground combat operation in which their principal responsibility was to go and seek out the enemy and engage them in combat.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe mission of most of our personnel in Iraq and in Syria now is different than that. \xc2\xa0Their principal responsibilities, setting aside those who are focused on counterterrorism and some of the special operators there that are conducting raids. \xc2\xa0The bulk of our servicemembers are engaged in a training, advice and assist mission. \xc2\xa0This means they are supporting Iraqi forces on the ground in Iraq who are, themselves, responsible for taking the fight to ISIL in their own country. \xc2\xa0Those forces, those Iraqi forces, are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government and U.S. forces have been deployed in relatively small numbers to support their efforts, to offer them advice, including tactical advice, to carry out those operations and to maximize their likelihood of success.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we have said on a number of occasions that that responsibility requires tremendous courage and professionalism because it\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous. \xc2\xa0Iraq is a dangerous place, and there have been situations in which U.S. military personnel have found themselves in combat situations when in the context of carrying out this training, advising and assist mission. \xc2\xa0That is why those soldiers that are deployed and given this role and given this mission are armed for combat, they are trained for combat, and some of them have had to engage in combat. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tTragically, I think at least three of them now have died in combat, and we owe them and their families a debt of gratitude for the tremendous sacrifice they have made for the safety and security of our country. \xc2\xa0Again, I know that our critics want to ascribe a variety of motives to this explanation. \xc2\xa0And what the Commander-in-Chief, his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, his Secretary of Defense have all consistently done is try to be as precise and as clear as possible about what exactly the mission is that our men and women in uniform are pursuing in Iraq and in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tBob.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, a quick follow-up, really. \xc2\xa0Since we brought up the fight against ISIS in Iraq, as they\xe2\x80\x99ve been squeezed -- as ISIS has been squeezed in other parts of the country or wherever they\xe2\x80\x99ve launched a series of suicide or car-bomb attacks, any number of them in Baghdad itself, does the United States have any kind of role in securing Baghdad right now that you know of?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Iraqi forces obviously do have a responsibility both to proactively go after ISIL and fight for their own country. \xc2\xa0They also have a responsibility to try to protect the Iraqi people from terrorist attacks that are perpetrated by ISIL extremists. \xc2\xa0So they are responsible for doing both. \xc2\xa0And our men and women in uniform that are providing training and are providing some advice and assistance are providing them that training, advice and assistance even as they try to perform both of those functions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In Baghdad, you mean?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, in Baghdad there are Iraqi security forces. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a big city, I know. \xc2\xa0I understand.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0In Baghdad, for example, there are Iraqi security forces that are there to protect the city. \xc2\xa0Some of those forces have been trained by the United States and our coalition partners. \xc2\xa0That probably, I guess, is the most tangible example I can give you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yeah, I want to follow up on TPP. \xc2\xa0The ITC report was a prerequisite for congressional consideration of the deal on the Hill. \xc2\xa0Can you just say what the White House preference is in terms of timing? \xc2\xa0Will you start the clock on that congressional proceedings now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Mike, what we have said is that we\xe2\x80\x99d consult with the Democrats and Republicans in Congress about the best strategy for getting the TPP agreement approved as soon as possible. \xc2\xa0So the White House has been in touch with Democrats and Republicans who are supportive of the agreement to develop a legislative strategy for moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And are you resigned to this probably -- I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s only I think five or six weeks that they\xe2\x80\x99re in session before the long recess. \xc2\xa0Is this only going to be something that happens in the lame duck session at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not necessarily. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to consult about the best path forward and we would like to see Congress act soon to approve the agreement. \xc2\xa0And the case that we have made is consistent with the argument that the Chamber of Commerce and other influential Republican-leaning organizations have made, which is that every day that goes by is a missed opportunity for American businesses and American workers to benefit from this agreement. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that we\xe2\x80\x99ll build the same bipartisan coalition that we built last year to give the President the authority necessary to negotiate this agreement, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to build a similar bipartisan coalition to approve the agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I noticed that the White House has been in touch with Democrats and Republicans on the Hill. \xc2\xa0I think Denis McDonough was up there this week. \xc2\xa0Can you say when the last time was that the President spoke directly with either the Speaker or to Senator McConnell?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t, Mike, primarily because we\xe2\x80\x99ve preserved the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to engage in private conversations. \xc2\xa0But I can just tell you as a general matter that our consultations on this issue have -- well, let me say it this way. \xc2\xa0Both Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan have indicated on a number of occasions that they believe an agreement like this would be in the best interest of the United States and our economy. \xc2\xa0So it certainly makes sense that we would coordinate with them, even at the highest levels, on the path for legislative approval.</p>\n<p>\n\tSusan, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Two things. \xc2\xa0While you were out here in the briefing, it seems like CNN -- I\xe2\x80\x99m looking on Twitter here so I can\xe2\x80\x99t be quite sure -- is reporting that U.S. officials are saying that the early belief is that a bomb brought the plane down -- the Egypt airplane down. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can confirm that they\xe2\x80\x99ve found wreckage and whether that -- if you could confirm that U.S. officials are believing this is a bomb.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I saw some of that reporting before I walked out here and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an intelligence assessment to share at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0The second question is a little more complicated. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if -- I know that at the beginning of the administration the President really stressed the importance of not including lobbyists coming into the administration -- there were some exceptions. \xc2\xa0But does he feel the same way about it when -- does he have the same concern when officials leave the administration? \xc2\xa0That when they become lobbyists, do they need to sign up and be transparent about that disclosure?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Susan, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the details in front of me, but I know that some of the restrictions that the President put in place on his first day in office didn\xe2\x80\x99t just apply to individuals who might be considering employment in the federal government during the Obama administration; there were also commitments that incoming administration officials had to make about limiting their lobbying activities after leaving government. \xc2\xa0And so there are prohibitions, or at least limitations, that apply to former Obama administration officials.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House advise people leaving? \xc2\xa0Do they remind them of that and their requirements? \xc2\xa0Is there a process --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, there is. \xc2\xa0As part of the out-boarding process, you\xe2\x80\x99re reminded of the commitments that you\xe2\x80\x99ve made on the way in that would limit your job prospects on the way out. \xc2\xa0And look, many people have raised concerns about how historically there\xe2\x80\x99s been a revolving door between the federal government and K Street. \xc2\xa0And the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, again, that he initiated on his first day in office were to close that revolving door, both in terms of the impact it has on people seeking to enter the government, but also based on restrictions that individuals committed to on their way out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not just K Street that these individuals are going to. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if anybody left the White House that went to go on and lobby on behalf of engagement in Cuba, if -- and they\xe2\x80\x99re contacting administration officials, should they have registered to lobby?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I assume -- it sounds now like you\xe2\x80\x99re asking about a specific case, and why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just walk through the details and -- help you understand how the rules might apply in a particular case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0Luis Miranda left the White House. \xc2\xa0He went to the Trimpa Group. \xc2\xa0He did, from what I understand, engage in contacting the White House on that issue repeatedly, and from what I understand there\xe2\x80\x99s no lobbying disclosure records to show for that. \xc2\xa0I have written about this, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about a lot -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of discussion about the Iran narrative this week, but there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a lot of discussion about the -- and the timeline -- and there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a lot of discussion about the Cuba timeline and the transparency on those negotiations. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Well, look, we can take a look and see if we can provide you some additional information. \xc2\xa0It sounds like -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that any of that disclosure would apply to the administration, but we can take a look.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0To Luis Miranda specifically?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work here anymore.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, so that\xe2\x80\x99s why --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So maybe you should go ask him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to contact him. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it important for the White House to have some level of -- on the Cuba issue -- to have had some level of surprise on that issue? \xc2\xa0Or I mean, is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s right and the White House\xe2\x80\x99s right to -- and the State Department -- to engage in diplomacy behind the scenes before announcing a major initiative like trying to normalize relations with Cuba or another country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s entirely appropriate. \xc2\xa0And that certainly has applied to other diplomatic breakthroughs that have been -- that the United States has benefitted from in just the last couple of years. \xc2\xa0And when we were negotiating to secure the release of Americans who were being unjustly held in Iran, that was not something that we discussed extensively in the past. \xc2\xa0When the United States was working behind the scenes with China to get them to make some significant commitments to fight carbon pollution in their country, that I think -- the results of those negotiations I think were a surprise to many in the public, but the United States enjoyed significant benefits as a result.</p>\n<p>\n\tThose kinds of negotiations, that kind of diplomacy is often most effective when it\xe2\x80\x99s done behind the scenes, as you described it. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:35 P.M.
