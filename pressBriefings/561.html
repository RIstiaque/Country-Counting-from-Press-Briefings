Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p class="p2">1:43 P.M. EST</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House on the day before the State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make, so I\'ll go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p class="p2">Associated Press.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with Syria.\xc2\xa0 The talks in Geneva do not seem to be going particularly well and now the Syrian regime says they won\'t even discuss Assad leaving, which has been non-negotiable for the U.S.\xc2\xa0 So if the regime is not even willing to discuss Assad leaving then what really is the purpose of the talks?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the issue of President Assad not being a part of a transitional governing authority is not one for the United States to decide.\xc2\xa0 The reason why it\xe2\x80\x99s non-negotiable is not because the United States says that, it\xe2\x80\x99s because the people of Syria have said that, and the opposition has said that.\xc2\xa0 And so the transitional governing authority has to be one that is reached in accordance and by mutual consent, and that\'s why Assad cannot be part of the future of Syria or part of this transitional authority.</p>\n<p class="p2">Now, I\'m not in a position to judge on a daily basis or give a play-by-play of the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 The process, as you know, is being run by the Joint Special Representative Brahimi and the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 And as you will have seen from his public comments over the past few days, Mr. Brahimi has been keeping the press apprised of developments each day, so he and his office are the place to go for those kinds of evaluations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">What\xe2\x80\x99s important is that the two parties have sat in the same room over the past several days to discuss critical issues, and this process is ongoing and I would expect quite a few ups and downs along the way.\xc2\xa0 This was, as I said last week and others, including the President, have made clear, always going to be difficult, but it is the only way to end the conflict in Syria.\xc2\xa0 It has to be ended through a negotiated political settlement.\xc2\xa0 So negotiations like this are by their nature long and complicated, but the aim is to find consensus, and that\'s what Mr. Brahimi is focusing on.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly has our support in that effort.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that you have seen on the ground in the talks so far that gives you any confidence that there is something that can be accomplished here?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Of course there\xe2\x80\x99s something that can be accomplished here, and that is eventually to reach consensus.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the purpose of the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 The fact is it took some time to get there, but the parties are meeting and the Geneva Communiqu\xc3\xa9 is the foundational document around which they\xe2\x80\x99re meeting.\xc2\xa0 And we are realistic about how difficult this is going to be, but we are completely convinced that this is the only way forward for Syria, and that\'s through negotiations.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To talk about the State of the Union a little bit, the details that came -- that the White House discussed over the weekend indicated that the President is going to focus a lot on executive action that he can take himself if Congress does not want to cooperate on certain issues.\xc2\xa0 But as you\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged, there are limits to what the President can do without Congress.\xc2\xa0 So does this State of the Union reflect a scaled-back agenda for the President for 2014?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think restoring security and economic vitality to the middle class is a very ambitious goal.\xc2\xa0 Restoring opportunity for all and expanding opportunity for all, those are very ambitious goals.\xc2\xa0 And those are the goals the President has identified.\xc2\xa0 Those are the goals that the President will work all year toward achieving.\xc2\xa0 And he will -- in conducting that work, he will use every means available to him to move forward towards achievement of those goals, and that includes working with Congress and passing legislation and signing it where Congress will work with him.\xc2\xa0 But he simply won\xe2\x80\x99t stop there, because, mindful of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to be cooperative at times, the President is going to exercise his authority.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to use his pen and his phone to advance an agenda that is focused squarely on expanding opportunity; making sure that in America, hard work and responsibility are rewarded and that opportunity is expanded.</p>\n<p class="p2">So that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any way to describe that except as ambitious.\xc2\xa0 And it would be the wrong thing to do for this President or any President to judge the progress we make as a nation, in Washington -- both in Washington and beyond, only by the number of bills we get passed through Congress, because the opportunity for advancing the agenda that the President has through other means is broad and deep, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll explore it.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Egypt, apparently General Al-Sisi is on the brink of announcing his candidacy for the presidency.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what you make of this in light of his willingness to use force against opposition in Egypt and the process of Egyptian democracy that seems again to be leading to a military leader.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me take apart that question and say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we recognize the important decision that Egyptians made regarding their constitution, and we now look to the Egyptian government to implement the rights protected and guaranteed under the new constitution.\xc2\xa0 And while the constitution affords some improved protections for human rights, we remain concerned about provisions within it allowing civilians to be tried in military courts.\xc2\xa0 Checks and balances between the military, the civilian government and the judiciary will also be important.</p>\n<p class="p2">The Egyptian government and the Egyptian people are navigating this transition process in a security environment that has been challenging and harmful for everyone.\xc2\xa0 It is the responsibility of any government to exercise restraint and to do its utmost to safeguard human rights and civil liberties, even when confronted with violence.\xc2\xa0 If Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s leaders want to ensure a political transition to democracy that ultimately improves the stability and economic prospects of their country and is respected by the Egyptian people, they must unequivocally ensure an environment that is free of intimidation and retribution.</p>\n<p class="p2">Only the people of Egypt can take the next steps in their transition, whether it is determining that presidential elections will take place before parliamentary ones, or that Al-Sisi will be able to run.\xc2\xa0 As they make these decisions for themselves, we will continue to urge them to do so in keeping with the spirit of their revolution and in line with the commitments the interim government has made.</p>\n<p class="p2">Any others?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Affordable Care Act --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- several senators -- Burr, Coburn and Hatch -- have apparently proposed not only repealing Obamacare, but replacing it with legislation that would provide their vision of health care.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on that?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t obviously seen a proposal.\xc2\xa0 What I have seen in press reports suggests that this looks very much like just another repeal proposal, another attempt to raise taxes on the middle class, to keep uninsured Americans with preexisting conditions locked out of the market, to raise costs on seniors, and to take away Medicaid from the millions of Americans who stand to gain coverage thanks to the expansion that was part of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 It also raises questions about what the impact could be on employer-sponsored coverage, which could potentially cause millions to lose the employer plans they have today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Now, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen further details, and yet we know, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it time and again, that Republican energy on this issue has been focused on repeal; focused on, again and again and again, an ideological pursuit that would result in depriving millions of Americans of what are core benefits.\xc2\xa0 It would result in restoring in the health care and health insurance equation in America the primacy of insurance companies over individuals, giving back to insurance companies the power to deny an American coverage because he or she has a preexisting condition or to charge women twice what they charge men because they\xe2\x80\x99re women.</p>\n<p class="p2">We strongly believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong course of action.\xc2\xa0 And as I said over the weekend, embracing repeal as a legislative or political strategy will not be successful in my view for the Republicans.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, can you comment?\xc2\xa0 Republicans are meeting this week to sort of map out their strategy for the coming year.\xc2\xa0 With regard to the debt limit, raising the debt limit, there is reporting that they may seek to attach provisions that would make changes to the Affordable Care Act as part of their conditions for increasing the debt limit.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty unequivocal in your position on that, but can you comment on those efforts?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the efforts you just described?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our view is and our position is what it has always been:\xc2\xa0 the American people cannot, and the President will not on their behalf, pay a ransom, an ideological ransom just so that Congress will do its job and pay the bills that Congress has racked up.\xc2\xa0 That\'s just irresponsible.\xc2\xa0 It would be, again, to inflict serious damage on the economy and the middle class at a time when the economy is poised to grow further and to create even more jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to pay a ransom when it comes to ensuring that the United States doesn\'t default for the first time in its history.\xc2\xa0 We saw this movie before.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of Republicans, including senior Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, said after the shutdown and after that disastrous ideological effort that they would not go down that road again.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly hope that that\'s the case.</p>\n<p class="p2">Let me move around.\xc2\xa0 Laura.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of reactions and statements about the security during the Olympic Games.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction to that?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Laura, as I and we discussed last week, we are in regular conversation with Russia about security issues surrounding the Olympic Games.\xc2\xa0 We will provide, as we have in the past and with the cooperation of Russian authorities, diplomatic security agents and FBI agents who will assist Americans and the security of Americans in Sochi.</p>\n<p class="p2">And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that while there is and has been an uptick in threat reporting around the Games, that is both a concern, but it is also something you would expect.\xc2\xa0 In an international event of this nature with this much attention, there are in the world we live in today frequently circumstances where we see increased threats and increased threat reporting.\xc2\xa0 So Lisa Monaco, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Counterterrorism Advisor and Homeland Security Advisor, is leading a working group on this issue, and we will continue to apprise the American people and those Americans who are traveling to Sochi of any information that we may have in order to assist them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">The State Department has issued a travel alert, which is not to say that Americans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go -- not at all -- but to advise Americans of the precautions they should take if they are going to Sochi, and to ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re registered or to recommend that they register with the State Department so they can receive information quickly should it be put out for their purposes.\xc2\xa0 So this is something we\xe2\x80\x99re going to constantly focus on in the coming days and weeks, and we will provide the American people with additional information as we get it.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I have a second question.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to the news that the French President is single due to the fact he\xe2\x80\x99s coming for a state visit?\xc2\xa0 Was it a problem for the White House in terms of organization?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The answer is no.\xc2\xa0 And to the second part of the question, the President and everyone here looks very much forward to the visit of the French President for a state dinner and state visit, and that remains the case.</p>\n<p class="p2">Ann.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On the Olympics, has Russia accepted any of the help that President Obama has offered?\xc2\xa0 And does the President have any concerns, the U.S. have any concerns that the situation in Ukraine might be so unsettled that Russia might try to take some action there to avoid any spillover or problems during the Olympics?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the first part, we are in regular conversations with Russian authorities.\xc2\xa0 We are always seeking more information and we have offered any help that the Russians might need.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">We strongly believe that Russia believes it is in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interest to take every measure to ensure a safe and secure Olympic Games -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s self-evident.\xc2\xa0 And we are obviously in a situation -- not as the host country, but as a visiting participant -- not in security lead but we are able to do what we can to take precautions.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense has talked about some of those precautions.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout of conversations in terms of what we have offered and what the Russian response has been, but we are simply always eager to get as much information as we can in a situation like this and working with the Russians in that regard and, of course, making clear to them that we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to provide whatever assistance we can to help make the games as secure as possible.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President talk about the Games at all during the State of the Union address?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any sense of whether this address will look like past ones in terms of length and structure?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no further details to provide on the State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 I very much want it to be exciting and surprising when you hear it tomorrow night.\xc2\xa0 I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say an address like this covers a lot of territory, as it always has in the past, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if that were the case tomorrow night.</p>\n<p class="p2">The President is continuing to work on the speech with his team, led by Director of Speechwriting Cody Keenan, and he very much looks forward to the opportunity to deliver the address tomorrow night, 9:00 p.m. Eastern Standard.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to the executive actions the President will be talking about tomorrow night, if this is the right course of action for the coming year, why has he not taken it already?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, two points.\xc2\xa0 One, the President has embraced the idea in the past that he can use his authority as President and the powers available to the President to advance his agenda on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 What we have said is that he views 2014 as a year of action and that he has tasked his team to come up with new ways in which we can -- he can -- advance that agenda.\xc2\xa0 And that includes legislative proposals and advances, as well as ways that we can move the country forward and expand opportunity and reward hard work through either executive action, signing executive orders, or through using the bully pulpit -- or the modern bully pulpit, the phone -- by bringing people together around an issue so that it gets the focus that a White House event or endorsement can give you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">You saw that recently when we had college presidents from across the country here and that was very much an example of what the White House can do in advancing an agenda not necessarily through Congress.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve seen it with the Promise Zones and the manufacturing hubs that the President has highlighted.\xc2\xa0 And I expect you\'ll see him take action in other areas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">The President\'s view is that he should use every tool available to him to move the country forward and to rally communities, businesses around the country as well as elected officials and others -- even journalists, among those at least who aren\'t jaded -- to the idea that -- it\'s just a joke -- that we can move this country forward together.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And "together\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just mean with Congress.\xc2\xa0 It means all of us together, and it means not just folks in Washington.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a theme that you\'ve heard the President discuss before, and you can expect he\'ll discuss soon and in the future.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that subject, you used the worded "jaded" there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Only talking about journalists.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Is the President frustrated?\xc2\xa0 Is he flustered?\xc2\xa0 Is he feeling feisty?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\'s a lot of alliteration happening here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the state --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Only \xe2\x80\x9cf\xe2\x80\x9d words.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ll stop there, but -- (laughter) -- what\'s his state of mind?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is fantastically enthused and enthusiastic about all of the --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He sounds like he\'s frustrated with Congress.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like he\'s frustrated and maybe a little bit flustered.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\'s an American citizen, and it stands to reason that he might be frustrated with Congress since most American citizens are.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we can\'t get things done with Congress.\xc2\xa0 He\'s also very optimistic.\xc2\xa0 And while, for good reason, most Americans may not have noted the passage of the budget deal or the passage of the omnibus legislation, we in this room know and a lot of people in Washington understand that that was a pretty big deal.\xc2\xa0 That was a break from the path that Congress had been traveling in dealing with these issues.\xc2\xa0 It was an example of what can happen when Democrats and Republicans get together, acknowledge their sincere differences but find common ground and move the country forward.</p>\n<p class="p2">And just doing that relatively modest deal means that a substantial portion of those harmful across-the-board cuts called the sequester are eliminated -- is eliminated -- and that investments in education and manufacturing will go forward.\xc2\xa0 And we won\xe2\x80\x99t have at least -- setting aside the debt ceiling and the question I took earlier from Mark, at least on the issue of the budget, we won\xe2\x80\x99t see Congress deliberately inflicting a wound on the American economy.\xc2\xa0 Simply by restoring regular order, they have created the possibility that the economy can grow and create jobs quicker and faster and better than it has in the past.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing some cooperation from Congress -- they passed a budget, the Speaker has talked about immigration, breaking it up into pieces, the President sounds amendable to that -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re getting some cooperation, why send this running shot down Pennsylvania Avenue that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to go over their heads?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\'re misinterpreting what we\xe2\x80\x99re saying here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not saying -- this is not an either-or proposition.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a both-and.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s reaching out to Congress and looking forward to the possibility of further bipartisan cooperation on big, medium and small issues.\xc2\xa0 And that includes a really big one -- comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 There is opportunity for bipartisan cooperation in Congress.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we don\'t control that entirely.\xc2\xa0 It is up to the decisions made by Republican leaders whether or not they want to reach across the aisle or whether they want to come to an agreement with the President and Democrats.\xc2\xa0 But if they do, if they see it as in their interest as well as hopefully the American people\xe2\x80\x99s interest, we can get some business done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And we\xe2\x80\x99ll pursue that.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to pursue only that.\xc2\xa0 That would be folly.\xc2\xa0 We should absolutely -- and the President should absolutely -- use the powers available to him and the unique authority that the office provides to move forward on expanding opportunity, on job creation, on manufacturing, on education, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do that.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just very quickly on Sochi, just to follow up, because last week Secretary Hagel said that the Russians have essentially agreed if the United States feels like it needs to go in and extract athletes, extract Americans, that the United States will be able to do that.\xc2\xa0 Is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of how President Putin feels, that that will be allowed?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Secretary Hagel would know far more than I about the specifics of those conversations with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 We do, as the Department of Defense announced some time ago now, have two ships in the Black Sea prepared for that contingency if it should arrive.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s precautionary; that\xe2\x80\x99s not in anticipation of something happening.\xc2\xa0 But certainly the Defense Department made clear that that is one reason why the ships are there -- would be there.</p>\n<p class="p2">So for more details I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Defense Department.\xc2\xa0 I certainly defer to Secretary Hagel on that.</p>\n<p class="p2">April.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to follow up on some words you said to Ann Compton.\xc2\xa0 You said \xe2\x80\x9cexciting\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csurprising.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What would be exciting and surprising about this State of the Union address?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be exciting or surprising if I told you today.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just give us the exciting part.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be fireworks?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s exciting.\xc2\xa0 At least since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on this side of the podium -- and that includes my two years prior to becoming Press Secretary -- we have not had an opportunity like we see this year when it comes to the state of our economy and the potential for it to grow and create jobs without either the enormous headwinds of the worst recession since the Great Depression or the Eurozone crisis, or, beginning in 2011, the ideological roadblocks that were thrown up by Republicans in Congress.</p>\n<p class="p2">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Now, of course, the last part remains to be seen -- there\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity for that kind of problem-causing by Republicans.\xc2\xa0 But as I was noting earlier, the budget deal and the omnibus passage has created an opportunity here, and we hope to seize it.</p>\n<p class="p2">So that\xe2\x80\x99s only to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s very exciting to be here and confronted with the opportunity to take action that the President sees before him, and that means working with Congress where Congress will work with us, and it means moving forward using his authority where Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t work with us.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what I think the American people expect of him and of the others they sent to Washington, to Congress.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I want to ask you a question on the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 Last year, at the very end of the State of the Union, the President made it clear that he was pushing for gun control.\xc2\xa0 And the State of the Union comes, tomorrow, at a time when we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing increased gun violence, increased gun fatalities -- the most recent publicized gun shooting -- Columbia, Maryland, down the road from here.\xc2\xa0 Should we expect to hear the President say something about gun control, be it states versus some kind of federal effort for gun control, or pushing it to the states -- each state to do something that might not create uniformity throughout the nation?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in answer to other questions about what specifically might be in the State of the Union, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask you to bear with us and wait to see what the President says.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to taking common-sense steps to reduce gun violence remains very strong.\xc2\xa0 He, as I said over the weekend and frequently, was very disappointed by Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to heed the will of the overwhelming majority of the American people -- in blue states, in red states, in purple states -- to expand background checks.\xc2\xa0 But he committed and remains -- he committed then and he remains committed now to taking action where he can to reduce gun violence, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that in the action that the administration has taken in fulfilling the 23 executive actions that were laid out in the plan to reduce gun violence, the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan to reduce gun violence, and in his commitment to take action where he sees he\xe2\x80\x99s able to do it in the future.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to get into specifics that he -- will he or won\xe2\x80\x99t he talk about, or how much will he or won\xe2\x80\x99t he talk about any issue.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What if he does not say anything about gun control?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s another way of asking me what he\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you should just -- and we should all wait to see what he says in the speech on all these issues.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the President -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been told it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an optimistic speech.\xc2\xa0 Does he believe the country is headed in the right direction?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He believes the country is poised to grow stronger, to create more jobs, and in doing so, to create more opportunity for middle-class Americans who have been squeezed fiercely for a long time now.\xc2\xa0 They were already feeling very squeezed, and then they got hit with the worst recession since the Great Depression, and they got hit hard.\xc2\xa0 And we as a country, and thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, have been pulling ourselves out of that hole and we have been growing and creating jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">But there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work to do, and this year creates -- or presents an opportunity to accomplish a lot of that work.\xc2\xa0 We can do it in cooperation with Congress, and where Congress will not cooperate we can and will do it engaging with Americans across the country and utilizing the authorities the President has.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, he feels very optimistic about that.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He does feel the country is headed in the right direction, period, or only if he can implement a majority of his agenda?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the country is continuing to grow out of the recovery and continuing to create jobs, but we can do much more.\xc2\xa0 And our --</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why is the country, then, so pessimistic?\xc2\xa0 Why is he more optimistic than the country?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because we are still not -- well, I get the frame you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to place on what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\xc2\xa0 He is optimistic about this country.\xc2\xa0 He always has been.\xc2\xa0 Even in the depths of the recession, he has been fiercely optimistic about the potential of America and his absolute faith that America\xe2\x80\x99s best days remain ahead of it.\xc2\xa0 But it requires --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That sounds like a TV campaign --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, but it requires -- but that\xe2\x80\x99s who he is constitutionally.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that, but --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Now, how do we get -- how do we lock that in?\xc2\xa0 We do it by, A, in Washington, not throwing a wrench into the work through threatening default again, or going down the road of re-litigating old fights, or pursuing partisan ideological agendas that serve no one\xe2\x80\x99s interests out in the country but serve a lot of special interests here in Washington?\xc2\xa0 So we all do that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s at least resisting the urge that is sometimes felt in some quarters in Washington to do harm.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the possibility of actually doing good, and that means passing legislation like comprehensive immigration reform that can do enormous good to the economy, provide enormous benefits to our businesses, provide enormous added security to our borders, provide enormous security for the middle class and benefits for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 We ought to do that.\xc2\xa0 And there are other things that we can do with Congress.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not all.\xc2\xa0 We can do more, and the President looks forward to doing more using the authority of the presidency.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that the country has tuned out Washington in general?\xc2\xa0 Not just the President but, I mean, all of Washington, all of us?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am fairly confident that Americans around the country, by and large, are focused on their own lives.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re focused on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in their communities.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re focused on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in their work lives, their families, their kids.\xc2\xa0 To the extent they\xe2\x80\x99re focused on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Washington, they are hoping that Washington is not causing them problems, at the very least, and is potentially helping their cause.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President believes we can do here and that he can do here.</p>\n<p class="p2">The skepticism that the American people have about Washington is well-founded, based on what we saw in October when Republicans decided to shut the government down out of pique and frustration and ideological fervor, that did a lot of harm to the middle class for no reason.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen since then is at least an improvement in the approach taken by Republicans reflected in the budget deal and the passage of the omnibus, and in some of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing about an interest in moving forward on immigration reform, and in some other areas as well -- which is not to say that suddenly we\xe2\x80\x99re all in harmony.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was just going to say you guys basically had a goose egg for the 2013 State of the Union, and you\xe2\x80\x99re still waiting on immigration reform, still trying to get some of this stuff done, and I know some of it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in -- how do you prevent -- how do you make the 2014 agenda have essentially more successes than what you got last time?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think, again -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a couple of whacks at this.\xc2\xa0 First, it is certainly not how we view it, and I would suggest should not be how you view it, that -- success in Washington of a President of any party should not be measured alone by how many bills Congress passes.\xc2\xa0 And honestly, given what this President has signed into law over the course of his presidency, I can say that from a position of pretty solid assurance that history will judge the legislation this President has gotten passed as huge and important.\xc2\xa0 But there is more and there is more potential out there -- there\xe2\x80\x99s more to do and there\xe2\x80\x99s more potential.</p>\n<p class="p2">What is also true is that you lay out goals at the beginning of the year that aren\xe2\x80\x99t limited to a one-year evaluation -- comprehensive immigration reform; there\xe2\x80\x99s no question we would have liked to have seen it passed by both houses and signed into law before the end of 2013.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll absolutely be glad and the country will benefit if the House moves and follows the path the Senate laid by passing comprehensive immigration reform and the President gets to sign it into law this year.\xc2\xa0 That would be a huge accomplishment for Congress and for the American people and the economy.\xc2\xa0 So that potential is there.</p>\n<p class="p2">And I also would say that you always aim high, and the President will continue to aim high because that\'s who we are.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t just throw out a couple of things that we know we can get done and then declare a victory and go home, because that\'s not what the American people want us to do.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not going to be satisfied with that.</p>\n<p class="p2">Ed.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On executive action, if the President wants to move quickly to create jobs, why not take that pen today and approve the Keystone pipeline?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, as has been the practice for many years now of administrations of both parties, the reviews involved in an international pipeline like this, a pipeline that crosses an international boundary are done or run by the State Department.\xc2\xa0 And that process continues at the State Department.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has always said he would be involved in this decision.\xc2\xa0 The State Department handles it, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve had it on their desk for what, two years?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President is doing is what his predecessors did, predecessors of both parties, which is allowing the State Department to oversee a process where this pipeline is evaluated, and when that process is done I\'m sure we will be made aware of it.</p>\n<p class="p3">But what the President believes is that it\'s important to maintain a process that was devised, again, and utilized by White Houses of both parties in order to ensure that the right decision is made.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In general, are there not limits to the executive power?\xc2\xa0 Obviously, any President -- Republicans have taken executive actions before and found out that without the weight of Congress, there are limits to it; for example, the idea of making sure that companies say they\'re not going to discriminate against the long-term unemployed.\xc2\xa0 If it\'s an executive action, then you don\xe2\x80\x99t really have the force of law behind it.\xc2\xa0 How do you actually enforce it?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m confused by the long-term unemployed aspect of this.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the actions that is --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- being reported on is that you\'ve got commitments from corporations --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect example of what the President can do, which is convene stakeholders and highlight one of the most important steps we can take, and that is to help find more jobs for the long-term unemployed by ensuring that they get a fair shot at applying for jobs they\'re qualified for.\xc2\xa0 And the commitments that major employers make in this regard will, if fulfilled, be enormously helpful to this significant challenge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Now, you\'ve seen the overall unemployment rate come down significant -- still too high, but it\'s come down significantly. Interestingly, if you look at the economic data, the percentage of unemployed who are unemployed for 26 weeks or less is now a little below the average over the past 10 years.\xc2\xa0 So the problem, the biggest part of the problem that remains with our unemployment is long-term unemployment compared to the average.\xc2\xa0 And we need to do everything we can, both through legislation like extending emergency unemployment insurance benefits -- which we certainly hope Republicans will agree to soon -- but also by bringing employers and others here, major corporations here to focus on the problem and see them commit to helping try to solve it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of broad approach that the President believes can help us make some progress on this issue.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other quick things.\xc2\xa0 Democrat Jim Moran did a radio interview with WAMU here in Washington, an NPR station, and basically said, "I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\'re going to get enough young people signing up to make this bill" -- he was talking about health care -- "work as it was intended to financially."\xc2\xa0 He was suggesting that not enough young people are signing up, not enough people are paying in, and that it\'s not going to work financially.\xc2\xa0 When a Democrat -- he\'s retiring, may be free to speak his mind -- when a Democrat is saying that the day before the State of the Union, how does the President go in tomorrow night and explain to his fellow Democrats how he thinks it\'s going to work?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that interview, but I would point you to the data that has been released that demonstrate we\'re -- in spite of the problems caused by the shaky rollout of healthcare.gov that we are seeing a significant surge in enrollment and signups.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">We are seeing, and we saw in December, a significant surge in the percentage of young Americans under 35 enrolling, and that those numbers are consistent with what we saw in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 And if you ask the Republicans in Massachusetts who supported, and in one case signed into law, the health insurance reform which is the closest thing to a model for the President\xe2\x80\x99s Affordable Care Act, they would say that that worked and that the percentage of young people who enrolled was adequate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So we believe we\xe2\x80\x99re on track.\xc2\xa0 We have a lot of work to do, and we continue to be very focused on making sure that the website functions effectively for the American people who want to use it to obtain insurance.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly encouraged by the data that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen of late that suggests the website is functioning effectively and that the interest in and desire for affordable, quality health insurance remains enormously strong.</p>\n<p class="p2">As I think we mentioned last week, we\xe2\x80\x99re now at 3 million and probably more in terms of sign-ups on the marketplace.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep monitoring this, but we believe we\xe2\x80\x99re moving in the right direction.</p>\n<p class="p2">Bill.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President offer specific examples of the actions he hopes to be able to take using his executive authority?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wait and see.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean you\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying you don\'t want to get specific --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but will there be specific examples?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going -- that\'s a description of the speech that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into at this point.\xc2\xa0 The speech remains unfinished.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in the last stages, obviously, on Monday here.\xc2\xa0 But I urge CBS and everyone else here to cover the speech and evaluate it through that prism and others.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking for days -- the White House has -- about, generally, what the President will do, presumably in an effort to build the audience, which has declined year over year. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that may be a statement about -- well, the media, but --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ooooh --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, I would say that we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously hopefully --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 0It\xe2\x80\x99s an aggregate number --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand, and I also think it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with past presidencies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">What is absolutely the case is that the State of the Union address for any President in any year of his or her presidency is an enormous opportunity to speak to legislators in Congress, but even more importantly, to the millions of America -- millions of Americans -- who tune in.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to that and will offer in his address his vision and his agenda for moving the country forward, and the steps that we can take to expand opportunity for all Americans, and the things we can do here to make sure that in America hard work is rewarded, responsibility is rewarded, and that everyone gets a shot at the opportunity that this country offers.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s his focus and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that reflected in what he says tomorrow night.</p>\n<p class="p2">Carol.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys have previewed pretty extensively the broad focus and areas of policy that the President will touch on domestically in the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 Can you give a similar flavor for how he\xe2\x80\x99s going to address some of the major foreign policy issues that have happened over the last year?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Carol, I would simply say that it would not be unreasonable to expect that in keeping with past tradition, the President will discuss matters of foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to get into any specifics.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking specifics.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking for a similar to the way that you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about his domestic agenda.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you have Afghanistan, major changes in Iran, Syria, Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any sense of how -- is there a certain approach he plans to take in terms of addressing these issues?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would set aside the language of the speech and simply say that the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach on these matters has been guided by his determination to do everything he can as President and Commander-in-Chief to ensure that we are protecting the country, protecting Americans in uniform abroad as well as American civilians abroad and our allies, and that we are being as effective as we can in how we carry out the enormous responsibilities that our military, our intelligence services, our diplomatic corps bear in the fulfillment of their jobs.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say -- the big NSA speech -- is that something that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be addressing tomorrow night?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details on subsections of the speech.</p>\n<p class="p2">Chris.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe the lack of federal nondiscrimination protections for LGBT workers contributes to inequality in this country?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chris, the President believes that we ought to pass an Employment Non-Discrimination Act because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for LGBT Americans and it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for our economy, full stop.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a particular analysis behind that because the sentiment is pretty clear.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a possibility that ENDA or a federal executive order barring LGBT discrimination will come up tomorrow in the speech?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I really have no more details to provide on the content of the State of the Union address.</p>\n<p class="p2">Anita.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was going to say \xe2\x80\x9cor any content\xe2\x80\x9d -- have you given us any content?\xc2\xa0 Could you talk -- you have been asked this question.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear an actual yes or no on this.\xc2\xa0 Has the President expressed whether he feels he is the authority to raise the minimum wage, as some groups are asking him to do, through contracting?\xc2\xa0 So just for those that contract with the federal government?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked that question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer for it.\xc2\xa0 I can simply say that the President believes Congress ought to act to raise the minimum wage.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But going with the pen and the phone analogy here -- I mean, so there have been studies written and some groups, progressive groups calling for him just on that one piece.\xc2\xa0 So not nationwide, obviously, just workers who work for companies that contract with the federal government.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the reporting on that, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the reporting around that, and I think I did take a question not from that angle on this and simply said that we have obviously received in this process as part of what began right after Thanksgiving in the solicitation of ideas and proposals a lot of interesting ideas from a lot of people in a lot of areas, both legislative and executive.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a reading to give to you on each of those ideas.\xc2\xa0 What the President decides and acts on will be I think reflected in the State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Cheryl.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Friday, the President appointed two new people to his legislative affairs office; there\'s a new director there as well.\xc2\xa0 Does that signal any new approach to his dealings with Capitol Hill?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We, and the President in particular, remain committed to working with lawmakers of both parties to try to find common-sense solutions to the challenges that the country faces, and that focuses principally on economic challenges that we face -- the need to expand opportunity, to reward hard work, to continue economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 But it extends into other areas, obviously.</p>\n<p class="p3">So when it comes to the staff that he hires to help him achieve that, he\'s very pleased with Katie Beirne Fallon being his OLA director and the hires that she has made.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to collectively keep working towards this goal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Look, in the end, it\'s about putting forward common-sense ideas, working with members of Congress of both parties to see if we can find common ground, and then those members deciding if they want to join us in making the necessary compromises that can move this country forward, or if they want to not join us, not come together and cooperate in a bipartisan way, but to pursue a different direction.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes that\xe2\x80\x99s because of a sincere policy difference; sometimes it\'s an ideologically driven difference.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re always going to keep pressing to see where we can find areas of common ground so that we can move the country forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Victoria.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the NSA is lurking in the background in your game of Angry Birds, waiting to scoop up all your personal data as you lob hapless creatures into the air.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I mean, it seems like this is -- the last bastion of American freedom has been breached.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be on the radio, that question?</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, there seems to be something particularly egregious about going off the leaky apps.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that you need to understand that, of course, I\'m not in a position to discuss specifics of intelligence collection.\xc2\xa0 But to be clear, as the President said in his January 17th speech, to the extent data is collected by the NSA through whatever means, we are not interested in the communications of people who are not valid foreign intelligence targets.\xc2\xa0 And we are not after the information of ordinary Americans, which presumably contradicts the premise of your question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But then why are they taking it?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Victoria, I can\'t discuss specific means of data collection.\xc2\xa0 But to the extent that the NSA collects information, it is focused on valid foreign intelligence targets and not the information of ordinary Americans.\xc2\xa0 Look, I mean, terrorists, proliferators, other bad actors use the same communication tools that others use.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Angry Birds?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They use the same communication tools -- are you saying that if a terrorist uses an app -- I mean, I\'m not even sure what protection you\'re seeking there for a potential terrorist.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting that I\'m seeking protection for terrorists?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, but I mean, what I\'m saying is that the NSA in its collection is focused on the communication of people who are valid foreign intelligence targets.\xc2\xa0 They are not focused on the information of ordinary Americans.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the case in answer to questions about the variety of revelations that have been made in the press.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A Ukraine question and a follow-up on Egypt.\xc2\xa0 On Ukraine, is the administration considering a set of sanctions against President Yanukovych\'s government, including revoking visas on senior officials?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the question of Ukraine, we strongly support dialogue between the government and opposition and we urge both sides to continue negotiating, as a political settlement is the only way out.\xc2\xa0 We also urge both sides to refrain from violence. Only the government can ensure a peaceful resolution to the crisis, and it should take immediate steps to reduce tensions such as by releasing detained protesters and withdrawing the riot policy from downtown Kiev.</p>\n<p class="p2">The extraordinary session of parliament tomorrow offers an opportunity for the government to take concrete steps to resolve the crisis.\xc2\xa0 It is crucial that the government seize this opportunity and repeal the anti-democratic legislation it passed on January 16th.\xc2\xa0 The lack of trust between the protesters and the government shows how urgent it is for the government to take immediate steps to de-escalate the situation.</p>\n<p class="p2">Now, in specific reference to actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken or can take, the State Department has already revoked the visas of several people responsible for the violence.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to consider additional steps in response to the use of violence by any actors.\xc2\xa0 For more information on that, I refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on Egypt, were there any prior consultation between you and the Egyptian government about the nomination of General Al-Sisi to stand in the election, considering the opposition --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I said earlier that that\'s something for the Egyptian people to decide, so that\'s something for the Egyptian people to decide.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But don\'t you think that having a military man standing in an election sets a bad precedent for the region and the Arab Spring?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, as I said earlier in a statement that I\xe2\x80\x99ll spare others from repeating, we continue to be concerned about some of the provisions within the constitution -- for example, the capacity for civilians to be tried in military courts -- and the importance, in our view, of a balance between the military and the civilian government and the judiciary is always a concern.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s something we will watch very closely.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jared, you get the last one.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, something that\'s not usually in the State of the Union is overt political posturing.\xc2\xa0 So how much of a priority for the President is getting Democrats elected and maintaining the Senate and getting a Democratic majority in the House in 2014?\xc2\xa0 Where does that fall on his list of priorities?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President will support Senate Democrats, House Democrats, as you would expect.\xc2\xa0 And you\'re right that in the context of the State of the Union address, that\'s something that, without getting into details, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to be highlighted.\xc2\xa0 But the President will, of course, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen already, support Senate Democrats and House Democrats and those running for those offices in 2014.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is there any way --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Somalia -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\'t think anyone asked about it.\xc2\xa0 There were reports over the weekend about a U.S. airstrike in Somalia.\xc2\xa0 I just wonder, for the record -- I realize there may be sensitive details, but broadly can you comment on whether --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, all I can tell you is that U.S. forces yesterday conducted a coordinated operation against a senior al-Shabaab leader in Somalia.\xc2\xa0 For more details, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, will the President be -- is it fair to say that the President would be focusing on legislation and not executive action if he didn\'t have divided government right now?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that would be a mistake.\xc2\xa0 I think the President would be focused on both, because any President who doesn\'t take advantage of the unique powers of the presidency to move the country forward would be depriving himself or herself of the capacity to move it more forward and to grow the economy further and to create more jobs.</p>\n<p class="p2">So the President will -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a desire here to see this as an either-or proposition, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not that.\xc2\xa0 But you can be sure that the President fully intends to use his executive authority to use the unique powers of the office to make progress on economic opportunity, to make progress in the areas that he believes are so important to further economic growth and further job creation.\xc2\xa0 And that is in addition to calling on Congress to work with him, and work in a bipartisan way to advance these objectives as well.</p>\n<p class="p2">Thanks very much.</p>\n<p class="p2">END<br/>\n\t2:40 P.M.
