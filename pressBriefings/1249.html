EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BAER:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for getting on.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have Dan Pfeiffer, White House Communications Director, say a few words, and then Jeffrey Zients, who is the Deputy Director of Management and the U.S. Chief Performance Officer from here at OMB, say a few words.\xc2\xa0 Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go right to questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBy the way, everything here is on the record and for attribution.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tDan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ken.\xc2\xa0 And thanks, everyone, for joining us -- and welcome back from your holiday weekend.\xc2\xa0 As most of you, or some of you at least, have reported, this is an announcement involving a freeze in civilian federal worker pay. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLet me first put this in a little bit of context and talk briefly about what the announcement is.\xc2\xa0 And then I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Jeff talk through some of the details and what this means, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tTo put this in context, when this President came into office he inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, he also had an economic crisis that threatened to put the nation into a second Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 Our first step was to take emergency action to get the economy moving again.\xc2\xa0 We have broken -- the economy is growing now.\xc2\xa0 We are no longer losing jobs; we\xe2\x80\x99ve been gaining private sector jobs for many months now.\xc2\xa0 But families and businesses are still hurting and job growth is still too slow, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say on many occasions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOur top priority is making sure we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to help boost economic growth and spur job creation.\xc2\xa0 But as the economy recovers we also need to focus on addressing the massive deficit we\xe2\x80\x99ve inherited and the unsustainable fiscal course we\xe2\x80\x99re on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs this President has said many times, doing so is going to take making some very tough choices.\xc2\xa0 And just as families and businesses around the nation have tightened their belts in this economy, so must the government.\xc2\xa0 That is why today the President will announce that he\xe2\x80\x99s proposing a two-year freeze in civilian federal worker pay -- the two years are 2011 and 2012.\xc2\xa0 This announcement affects only civilians.\xc2\xa0 It does not affect military personnel.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd with that, let me turn it over to Jeff for some additional details of the announcement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Dan.\xc2\xa0 Let me start by taking you through the numbers.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As Dan said, the President is proposing a two-year freeze for civilian federal worker pay.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s for calendar year 2011 and 2012.\xc2\xa0 This will save $2 billion for the fiscal year which we\xe2\x80\x99re currently in -- fiscal year 2011 -- and will save $28 billion when you combine the savings from this year\xe2\x80\x99s freeze and the second year\xe2\x80\x99s freeze, calendar year 2012.\xc2\xa0 It will be $28 billion of savings across the next five years, and more than $60 billion in total over the next 10 years.\xc2\xa0 So those are the numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tClearly this is a difficult decision.\xc2\xa0 Federal employees are hardworking and dedicated and central to delivering essential services to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And today we are -- the President is clearly asking them to make a sacrifice.\xc2\xa0 We believe it\xe2\x80\x99s the first of many difficult steps ahead that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking in the upcoming budget to put our nation on sound fiscal footing -- steps that will ask for all of us to sacrifice. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tough decision, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also consistent with actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already made as part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Accountable Government Initiative to cut costs and do more with less.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tUpon taking office, the President froze salaries for senior White House officials.\xc2\xa0 And earlier this year, he proposed freezing salaries for all political appointees across the government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re going after excesses in contracting -- the more than $500 billion we spend each year in contracting.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re taking action across government to save at least $40 billion in contracting by the end of 2012.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President has also set an aggressive goal of reducing improper payments by $50 billion by the end of next year and has also directed agencies to dispose of excess real estate to save $8 billion over the next two years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn each of his budgets, the President put forward approximately $20 billion in terminations and reductions, encompassing more than 120 programs.\xc2\xa0 And the President has proposed a three-year freeze in security spending, which will bring non-security discretionary spending to its lowest level as a share of the economy in 50 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo you can see today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is really a continuation of our work to reduce costs and make government more efficient.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the many difficult decisions we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make in the months ahead.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, addressing the deficits will take tough decisions and sacrifices by all of us.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to working with both sides on Capitol Hill over the next several months to develop a common-sense deficit-reduction strategy that will rein in our deficits and keep our economy growing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BAER:\xc2\xa0 Great, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Operator, we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to take some questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Republicans on the Hill, a number of them have proposed pay freezes or even such things as a two-year furlough, which would be a pay cut.\xc2\xa0 One, why did you not simply allow Republicans to propose and perhaps enact this -- obviously with the help of Democrats in the Senate -- as opposed to doing this administratively?\xc2\xa0 And why did you decide on a two-year freeze as opposed to, say, a two-week furlough, which has been proposed in the House?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Joe.\xc2\xa0 This, as I mentioned earlier, is really a continuation of the work that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done in the Accountable Government Initiative, and the President, when he took office, immediately froze White House senior salaries, proposed earlier this year extending that political senior freeze across government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re acting today because the President needs to send by the end of this month, Tuesday, to the Hill locality pay for 2011, and we\xe2\x80\x99re also at the point in the budget process where we need to decide on 2012 compensation.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason for this timing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe will evaluate other proposals beyond federal workers, all the different various proposals from the fiscal commission and others, as part of our 2012 budget process and be rolling that out across the next couple of months.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, thanks for holding this call.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering in the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks if he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be calling on Congress to extend the unemployment benefits that are set to expire?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. PFIEFFER:\xc2\xa0 This announcement is specifically about federal pay. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, guys.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that since health care premiums are also going up for federal employees that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a freeze but also in a sense a pay cut? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Ed, there\xe2\x80\x99s been increases in premiums across all sectors, and what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about today is the annual increase, and there will be no annual increase for 2011 and 2012, so I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that pay has been frozen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, everyone, thanks for doing the call.\xc2\xa0 A couple of quick questions.\xc2\xa0 Does this need congressional approval?\xc2\xa0 What is the two-year savings?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned the one-year savings and the ten-year, but what about the two-year?\xc2\xa0 And finally, do you think that this will help the President make a case for not extending the upper-end tax cuts and why?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER:\xc2\xa0 Well, Margaret, let me answer your I think first and fourth question, or first and third.\xc2\xa0 It does require congressional action.\xc2\xa0 And this is about finding ways to deal with the deficit and cut spending.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t view this as part of a -- as specifically connected to the tax cut debate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat is a -- the case of -- the Republicans are going to have to make a case for why we should spend $700 billion to permanently extend the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the case they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make and explain how that comports with a seriousness about the deficit.\xc2\xa0 This is a separate announcement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 The two-year savings is in excess of $5 billion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys, for doing this.\xc2\xa0 Since federal workers are being asked to forgo or not have any pay increases for the next two years, can you make any assurance that the President is going to fight to try to prevent the reduction and the size of the federal workforces?\xc2\xa0 Or is that something that\xe2\x80\x99s likely as deficit reduction goes forward?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in the midst of the 2012 budgeting process.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, agencies are going to need to do more with less.\xc2\xa0 And no specific decisions have been made about the size of the federal workforce at this point.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll roll that out as part of the budget.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Interestingly, you guys are announcing this -- timing-wise, Jeff, it makes sense in terms of how you describe it.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s also been a ton of reporting, a ton of back and forth between the government and media about how much federal workers are paid, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re paid too much, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re paid -- the rate of increase.\xc2\xa0 Did that play in the decision at all?\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily the back and forth, but as you looked at the salaries, as you looked at, for instance, information from the Federal Salary Council, did that play in your decision at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 No, Jason.\xc2\xa0 The decision is made in the context of the difficult deficit situation and the need to make, as you point out, a decision at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, guys, again.\xc2\xa0 I realize that there has to be big cuts and that everything is being looked at.\xc2\xa0 But Jeff, I know you especially have worried a lot about recruiting top talent.\xc2\xa0 And with the hiring reforms and everything underway, I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious what you say to people who are considering applying or are in the process of applying for a job right now with the federal government, partly because they know that the pay and benefits are so generous.\xc2\xa0 And what do you say to those who may have just joined up knowing that, and now are facing a slightly less attractive pay and benefits package?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re right, we do need to continue to recruit the best and brightest to federal service.\xc2\xa0 I care about that passionately as a way to really drive strong performance to increase productivity and efficiency across federal agencies.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that we have a overall value proposition for employment that\xe2\x80\x99s quite strong and that a lot of people do want to serve, and that this freeze will not get in the way of our efforts to bring in the best and brightest.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for holding this call.\xc2\xa0 Just on the timing of this announcement, the deficit commission is going to meet this week.\xc2\xa0 Is there any sense of which this was announced because that deficit commission is unlikely to make any recommendation formally?\xc2\xa0 And will you expect any other deficit-related announcements this week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER:\xc2\xa0 No, Jeff explained it, and he can explain again, the timing of why we had to make this announcement now -- it involves a legal deadline coming very shortly.\xc2\xa0 And this is -- the deficit commission is going to finish the report on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see where that -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the result of that is and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be prepared to comment on that then.\xc2\xa0 But this should not be viewed as anticipating anything they may or may not do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 So just to repeat what I said earlier, the timing is driven by a legal requirement for the President to submit to the Hill a locality pay increase, and that will be zero here.\xc2\xa0 And also by where we are in the budget process, we\xe2\x80\x99re at the point where annually we decide what pay will be as part of the budget.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the driver of the timing here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, guys.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for doing the call.\xc2\xa0 Just following up one of the previous questions, so do you all agree with the critique that federal worker pay has increased excessively in the last 10 years, that it has outpaced private sector increases, and do you think -- and would the President be willing to consider proposals the Republicans make to actually cut that pay?\xc2\xa0 Or is he drawing a line here saying he\xe2\x80\x99ll freeze it but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t plan to do any further?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Dan, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that.\xc2\xa0 No, this is not in response to that recent coverage.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned before, this is in the context of difficult decisions that we need to make as part of deficit reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, thanks for the call.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you could just explain the figures for how it breaks down over the five years -- over the 10 years and beyond where those savings are made in addition to the obvious savings from a lack of increase in pay and whatnot?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make it sort of the simple version here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a little more complicated because of how the numbers compound and all the rest.\xc2\xa0 But let me just keep this simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe $2 billion for fiscal year \xe2\x80\x9811 is actually about a $3 billion or so annual run rate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s $2 billion because the fiscal year starts October 1st and pay is set on a calendar-year basis.\xc2\xa0 So the $2 billion only captures 9/12 of the actual savings.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, in out-years you get the benefit of the full annualized savings.\xc2\xa0 So think of it as around $3 billion, the second year being around $3 billion on an annual basis, or $2 billon in actual fiscal year 2012.\xc2\xa0 So take $3 billion plus roughly $3 billion -- you\xe2\x80\x99re at $6 billion.\xc2\xa0 You do that for 10 years; that\xe2\x80\x99s your $60 billion.\xc2\xa0 For five years it\xe2\x80\x99s slightly less than half because of that nine-month piece for the first couple of years, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how you get $28 billion for five years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, thanks a lot for taking the question here.\xc2\xa0 Just a real quick question on the function of this.\xc2\xa0 Would it also freeze someone\xe2\x80\x99s pay scale?\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s say this year someone is a GS-9.\xc2\xa0 Next year would they -- if they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, considering how many years they\xe2\x80\x99ve been working in their current position, let\xe2\x80\x99s say they were supposed to go to a 10 next year, would it freeze them at where their scale pay is right now, or it only freezes each level of the government pay scale?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 That individual -- that hypothetical individual would be eligible to receive such a promotion.\xc2\xa0 So if they were promoted, yes, they would go up, in fact.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BAER:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Listen, thank you, everyone, for getting on the call.\xc2\xa0 Again, this information is not embargoed, and if you need any further questions to be answered, feel free to contact us at OMB communications or of course the White House Press Office.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:53 A.M.
