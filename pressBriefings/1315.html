EDT</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you talk to the President about last night\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with House Democratic leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I talked to him briefly about it.\xc2\xa0 He said the meeting was quite productive -- I think that was the readout as well from the Speaker and the House leadership in helping to coordinate the agenda that the Democrats would pursue going forward.</p>\n<p>Look, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got an important vote in the Senate today on financial reform.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got some upcoming battles in the next few days on extending unemployment benefits to those who desperately need them.\xc2\xa0 And there will be a whole host of issues that we deal with as well economically when we come back from the August break, and they spent a lot of time talking about all that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The meeting wasn\xe2\x80\x99t contentious at all?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That was --- I think that was described by both parties as not being contentious.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel like any of the criticism that some of the House Dems had about his engagement was warranted?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Guys, we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of time on this subject this week.\xc2\xa0 I think they had a productive meeting, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve probably talked a lot about it.</p>\n<p>I will say this.\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, the House and the Senate have done a lot of work over the past two years in advancing an agenda that they can be proud of and that the American people can be proud will pay dividends in our economic recovery.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he lay out anything specific, though, in terms of how he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be more engaged going forward?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to -- I think I passed on that a minute ago.\xc2\xa0 But I appreciate it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a question switching topics?\xc2\xa0 In his meeting with Cameron next week, will he seek to clarify exactly what role BP played in the release of the Lockerbie bomber?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that with NSC.\xc2\xa0 I saw some stuff on that, but let me get a better or longer answer on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then another quick question --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say quickly on BP, I know that overnight there were problems with leaking oil out of the choke line and the sealing cap.\xc2\xa0 That was remedied this morning, and the pressurization tests that we signed off on beginning -- will begin in the next few hours.\xc2\xa0 They may have begun while we were on this plane.</p>\n<p>They will last about six hours in duration and take about a 48 -- be testing over about a 48-hour period of time in order to pass the, as I described yesterday, the integrity of the well through that pressurization.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to underscore that even as -- this testing will help determine what possible steps this blowout preventer and well -- how we can use this blowout preventer and well for what essentially is a top kill procedure and its ability to assist in the relief well through that closure.</p>\n<p>But at the same time, none of this testing affects the containment architecture that we have on there now that will over the course of the next few days ramp up to a containment capacity of 60,000 to 80,000 barrels of oil a day.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an important point to make.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, my only other question was whether you had any response to this Iranian scientist\xe2\x80\x99s claims that the U.S. paid him $50 million to stay?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into intelligence matters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we going to hear anything from the President on financial reg after the vote today?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That is very likely when we get back to the White House if the vote goes off as is planned.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We will -- I will have an update for you guys on that hopefully before we depart back in Grand Rapids.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to renew his push for $5 billion in tax credits?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Today?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, through the 48C program, I know that Capitol Hill is working on an extension of clean energy tax credits.\xc2\xa0 Today I think the President will focus on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about a bunch in the past couple days, and that is the investments in the Recovery Act that have created the type of battery-manufacturing facilities that the President is here to break ground on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Significant -- this is a location that was already scheduled to build battery packs for the Chevy Volt.\xc2\xa0 And a couple of days ago, Ford announced that its electric Ford Focus, the batteries will also be produced here.\xc2\xa0 So you can see there\xe2\x80\x99s an increase in the demand for this type of battery technology as more and more auto manufacturers plan for and roll out models that will need this type of technology.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any quick comment to the fact that the Senate appears to have voted to overcome this procedural hold?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously, in this era, something has to pass cloture before it can pass the Senate -- in somewhat of a departure in how the place normally works.\xc2\xa0 But such as it is, I think the vote demonstrates -- first of all, I would say the President is appreciative of Democrats and Republicans that have stood together to put in place the strongest rules in the road that will -- going forward to prevent the type of financial calamity that we had just two years ago.</p>\n<p>We look forward to the Senate taking the next step later today to pass financial reform.\xc2\xa0 And I know the President looks forward to signing that bill as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 It is a big step forward, and it is part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s financial -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, economic recovery plan.\xc2\xa0 We talked about this at the very beginning of the administration.\xc2\xa0 We cannot continue to operate using the same rules that got us into this mess.\xc2\xa0 And I think this will be a vote that Democrats will talk about through November as a way of highlighting the choice that people will get to make in 2010.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the signing ceremony?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any plans at this point for that?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We were talking a little bit about that just briefly before we left, but we will -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get an update on that before we go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Early in the week?\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My sense is with Cameron and such in town on Tuesday, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s next week, it would probably be a little bit later in the week.\xc2\xa0 But I will check on whether there\xe2\x80\x99s any clarity on that before we lift off.\xc2\xa0 Like I said, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get some information on timing for a statement when we get back.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n12:32 P.M.
