EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I apologize for the delay.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we are watching and monitoring very closely a very fluid and dynamic situation, so I will do my best to answer some of your immediate questions.\xc2\xa0 We may take some of those, again, as events, as we can all see, are changing very quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that, Mr. Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Has President Obama spoken to President Mubarak about these issues?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me start by giving you a little bit of a rundown in the President\xe2\x80\x99s briefings thus far today.\xc2\xa0 Overnight he received a memo from the National Security Advisor on the latest situation.\xc2\xa0 I think you all have been briefed on the fact that the President\xe2\x80\x99s PDB was about 40 minutes in the Oval Office this morning entirely on the situation in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 We convened not too long ago, about 12:30 p.m., a deputies committee meeting in the Situation Room run by Denis McDonough where we heard directly from Ambassador Margaret Scobey from Egypt and the State Department and others.\xc2\xa0 Those -- that briefing was relayed back to the President not too long ago in the Oval Office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we have -- throughout the process our ambassador and others in the government have been in touch with the Egyptian government.\xc2\xa0 President Obama has not spoken with President Mubarak.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have plans to and does he stand by him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are -- again, we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring a very fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to what I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve said over the course of this, Ben, and that is this is not about picking a person or picking the people of a country.\xc2\xa0 And as you heard Secretary of State Clinton say today, we are deeply concerned about the images and the events that we see in Egypt today.\xc2\xa0 We monitor those events closely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The security personnel in Egypt need to refrain from violence.\xc2\xa0 Protesters should refrain from violence, as well.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve said that throughout this.\xc2\xa0 We think the government, as many of us have said throughout the day, need to turn the Internet and social networking sites back on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The legitimate grievances that have festered for quite some time in Egypt have to be addressed by the Egyptian government immediately, and violence is not the response.\xc2\xa0 A space has to be created for a meaningful dialogue that addresses, again, those very legitimate grievances.\xc2\xa0 Our belief in their right on the freedom of expression, of association and of assembly -- we have, and I outlined some yesterday, some very specific things that the government must begin to do immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other quick ones, please?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say these legitimate grievances have to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering:\xc2\xa0 Or what?\xc2\xa0 What can the President do if these matters are not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, first and foremost, this is a situation that will be solved by the people in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 I will say this, that we -- sorry -- we are monitoring closely the situation, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said.\xc2\xa0 We will be reviewing our assistance posture based on events that take place in the coming days.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s certainly part of it.\xc2\xa0 But this is -- this will be solved by the Egyptian people.\xc2\xa0 But it is important -- and there\xe2\x80\x99s a very important opportunity for the Egyptian government to address, again, grievances that have been in place for a number of years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, lastly, from the White House perspective, can you put what\xe2\x80\x99s happening today and the last couple of days into context?\xc2\xa0 Do you see this as a crisis that is teetering on something potentially much broader spreading across the Middle East?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring this in a number of places.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- we saw what happened in Tunisia.\xc2\xa0 Again, as I said yesterday, I think you have different countries in the region at different stages of political development.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to generalize across a series of countries.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the United States think of the Egyptian military sending tanks into the streets?\xc2\xa0 And what do you think the military\xe2\x80\x99s role should be appropriately?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that, as we have urged repeatedly for many days, we urge a strong restraint.\xc2\xa0 This is not a situation that should be addressed with violence.\xc2\xa0 Security forces and the military should be restrained in anything that they do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been reports of clashes between the Egyptian military and the Egyptian police.\xc2\xa0 Have you heard anything about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into -- obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring this situation.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a count of everything that\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the United States doing about aid and are reviewing --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I said a minute ago, obviously we will be reviewing our assistance posture based on events now and in the coming days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, has the President been having any phone conversations at all with other allies, conferring about the situation in Egypt?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there have been a number of meetings throughout the government.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s another higher level principals meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning.\xc2\xa0 But I am unaware of any calls at this point that have been made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why this message that you are delivering from the podium and what we heard from Secretary of State Clinton earlier today, why the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t himself making those same comments on a phone call?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it seems that it would be more powerful if the President can pick up the phone, call President Mubarak and make the same remarks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dan, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that we have -- we are in continual contact with -- throughout levels of our government with the Egyptian government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\'s more weight, though, if the President were to make that call himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, and I think you heard the President speak quite clearly yesterday on this topic.\xc2\xa0 And I think what\'s also very important is we have not waited for the events of the past several days to bring up our concerns and the concerns of the Egyptian people about what I said:\xc2\xa0 association, assembly, freedom of expression, freedom -- Internet freedoms.\xc2\xa0 Those are discussions that are had at every opportunity when anybody from our government meets with the Egyptian government.\xc2\xa0 When the President last spoke with President Mubarak, he brought these concerns up.\xc2\xa0 When we spoke in Cairo, these concerns were brought up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I would say only in terms of going forward, we continue to monitor a fast-paced situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, what -- can you kind of talk to us a bit about the role that Egypt has played in that region?\xc2\xa0 And any concerns at all that this situation, this crisis, could hurt the relationship?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I think obvious -- you know, we have seen the role that, on issues like Middle East peace, that, either in current negotiations or historically, the government of Egypt has played, and that\'s important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there is a responsibility that is had by the government of Egypt regardless of the role that they have played internationally or regionally over the course of any number of years.\xc2\xa0 They also have to address the grievances that have built up for those same number of years within the country of Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is an important opportunity to institute concrete and legitimate political reforms, to address the deep concerns of the Egyptian people and make some substantive progress.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sunlen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, why does the U.S. still support countries and regimes that we know do not respect human rights, like Egypt?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we have documented, again, the concerns that some have had for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 As is the case with a country like China, we have a whole host of bilateral issues that we deal with countries on, as we did in the recent trip.\xc2\xa0 There were economic, security and basic human rights issues that we discuss when the President meets with his counterparts.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our belief is it is important to have those conversations very directly with those leaders.\xc2\xa0 If you walk away from the table of engagement, you can\xe2\x80\x99t deliver that message in a face-to-face manner.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes obviously that\'s tremendously important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talk about urging restraint.\xc2\xa0 Has that message been communicated from the United States directly to the Egyptian military to refrain from violence, or is just from the podium?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it has been communicated not just from this podium, not just in the remarks of the Secretary of State, but at levels within the Pentagon to the Egyptian military from the Egyptian military, from the State Department, from the words and conversations that have been had by Ambassador Scobey -- all levels -- and also the words, most importantly, of the President yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that the time has passed now for Mubarak to make these changes, these political changes that you\xe2\x80\x99re calling for?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I -- absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 I think the people of Egypt want to see, clearly and quickly, legitimate steps taken toward concrete reforms.\xc2\xa0 The time for that to happen has most certainly come.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Robert, you said that he has not talked to President Mubarak.\xc2\xa0 Has he tried to reach him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has there been discussion of trying to reach him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a very fluid situation, and I have no doubt that there are conversations happening as I brief about Egypt on a whole host of levels and issues inside the building.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is the President not standing where you\xe2\x80\x99re standing right now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring a very fluid situation, Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He talked about it yesterday, but since he talked about it, the situation on the ground has changed pretty dramatically.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt by the time I finish here it will have changed more, and may several times before we all go to bed tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has there been any discussion of concerns expressed by people overseas if they don\xe2\x80\x99t hear directly from the President talking into the camera himself?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, because, again, I think you have seen a very clear and consistent message across all levels of our government in our interactions with the government in Egypt and in Cairo, the statements that I\'ve made publicly in here and the messages that have been communicated most recently by Secretary of State Clinton just a few hours earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I believe earlier you said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be reviewing our assistance posture depending on the events of the next several days.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Could you elaborate on that?\xc2\xa0 Has that been discussed in the meetings with the President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It has.\xc2\xa0 It has.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what kind of change in posture could there be?\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about cutting off aid?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think at this point I would just leave it to the fact that there -- we are watching very closely the images and events that you\xe2\x80\x99re watching and how that could very possibly impact our assistance to Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is that part of a bigger -- is there planning going on now for the possibility that he would be overthrown?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a robust set of meetings that are being had to discuss a whole host of issues right now in Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Plans for any contingency like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A whole host of meetings that are going on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "Deeply concerned", "urging restraint" -- to this point, from my knowledge, no U.S. official has come out and condemned the violence.\xc2\xa0 Is it time to condemn the violence?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, Mike.\xc2\xa0 Urging restraint and then seeing violence is obviously very counter to what we believe should be had.\xc2\xa0 And we would strongly condemn the use of any violence on either side during this situation, absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seemed that you were delayed today because we were waiting to see if Mubarak would have anything to say to his people and perhaps a global audience.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House troubled that he has not come out, to our knowledge, to say something?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, we were delayed for a whole host of reasons, not the least of which I wanted to make sure that we have the very best available information as we come out here.\xc2\xa0 We are monitoring any and all actions and words that are coming out of the country, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this kind of a classic foreign policy dilemma for the U.S., where he may not be great to his own people but you have to be worried about who might replace him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mike, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea for me to get into hypotheticals.\xc2\xa0 I will say this, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not hypothetical, and that is that the situation should be addressed through concrete reforms.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the people of Egypt demand.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they deserve.\xc2\xa0 Leaders of any country and any region of the world have to be responsive and responsible to the people they govern.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly true in this instance.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s true in each and every country around the globe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, has the Vice President or Secretary Clinton spoken to President Mubarak?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated list of calls.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President has not.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to State on -- if anything has happened.\xc2\xa0 Again, things are moving quite quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you share with us what world leaders the President has spoken with in the last 24 hours on this situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I do not believe that he has spoken --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anybody from Saudi Arabia, the king of Jordan --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I -- the President has not.\xc2\xa0 Again, we are in touch at a whole host of levels.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to State on some of this, on what contacts have been had.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re watching this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he spoken to Prime Minister Cameron?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has any thought been given to pulling our ambassador temporarily?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Chuck, we spent some time in the meeting at 12:30 p.m. discussing the security of the embassy, the security of American citizens inside of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 There are no reports at this point of Americans in distress, but obviously this is an ongoing situation that we monitor.\xc2\xa0 The State Department --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared if we need to evacuate --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The contingencies have been discussed.\xc2\xa0 And obviously there are preplanning for a lot of that -- is in the pipeline for a whole host of contingencies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will say, obviously, that the State Department has issued a travel alert to any United States citizen considering travel to Egypt and urging people not to pursue non-essential travel to the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the United States, through the ambassador or somebody, officially condemned the house arrest of ElBaradei?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously -- I don\'t -- I did not hear the ambassador discuss it directly.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, again, this goes into -- directly into our concern about expression, association and assembly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If he is under house arrest, do you guys condemn --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me say this, that this is an individual who is a Nobel Laureate, who the President has -- knows and has worked with on a host of nuclear security issues, as the former -- as the once head of the IAEA.\xc2\xa0 And these are the type of activities that the government has a responsibility to change.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, it sounds like we could still hear from the President sometime today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Chuck, the situation -- as the situation changes, all of that will be evaluated.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just said that if Mohamed ElBaradei is indeed arrested, that would feed into your concerns.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken of concerns a lot.\xc2\xa0 Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you using the term outrage for some of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen?\xc2\xa0 And is there a sense of making an equivocal statement when you talk about violence on one side versus violence on the other?\xc2\xa0 Is it really comparable at this stage?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan, this is not a solution that will be solved on either side with violence.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you, Jonathan, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out here for three days discussing this issue.\xc2\xa0 I have not equivocated on the seriousness of the situation.\xc2\xa0 We have not equivocated on our very public posture that, as I said a minute ago, violence is not going to solve this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What will solve the grievances of those that are protesting in Egypt is the government addressing those concerns.\xc2\xa0 Free and fair elections is something we outlined yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We condemned the continuation of emergency law earlier this -- last year, when it was extended.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been in place for three decades.\xc2\xa0 That should come to an end.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no situation that -- this is certainly not a situation that will be solved by violence.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the government\xe2\x80\x99s response cannot be violence.\xc2\xa0 The government\xe2\x80\x99s response has to be to hear, to understand and to act on the concerns of its people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 Apparently Vodafone -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a British company -- is the company that turned off Internet access for the people of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Is there any way or any thought to pressuring Vodafone to put that network back on?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me take the specific company question and make sure that I\xe2\x80\x99m clear on whatever role any company is playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, without getting into the individual company, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll check on with NSC, we have a -- it is our strong belief that inside of the framework of basic individual rights are the rights of those to have access to the Internet and to sites for open communication and social networking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, beyond what you\xe2\x80\x99ve said today about aid, how has it been conveyed to the Egyptian authorities that billions of dollars in U.S. help could be in jeopardy if they don\xe2\x80\x99t change their ways?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Peter, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know every conversation that\xe2\x80\x99s been had at every level in this government, but suffice to say this is something that has been discussed and we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you see any evidence at all that anything that you\xe2\x80\x99ve said, the President has said, Secretary Clinton has said, has changed the equation on either side, the government or the protesters?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask for an evaluation of some of that from -- in terms of measuring some actions based on media.\xc2\xa0 I do know that the people of the country are watching what is said here.\xc2\xa0 I know that, again, we see some limited amount of information that comes out, and social networking sites before they were shut down, that they\xe2\x80\x99re very attuned to our words about their individual rights.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the communications question -- I know you had that deputies meeting earlier with the ambassador -- are you guys having a hard time understanding and figuring out everything that\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the ground in Cairo and elsewhere, or are you pretty clear on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we got a very thorough rundown from the ambassador who\xe2\x80\x99s at the embassy right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not -- none of these shutdowns, in terms of the Internet, it\xe2\x80\x99s not affecting your ability to gather information?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, we have a host of ways to gather information.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just to follow real quick on the aid that you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing, you\xe2\x80\x99re confident that prior to you announcing it here, the Egyptians are aware that their aid is under review?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I want to be careful, Hans, that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know every conversation that\xe2\x80\x99s been had.\xc2\xa0 But suffice to say, I think I was rather clear in what I said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Suffice it to say?\xc2\xa0 Could we call it a warning?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what needs to happen.\xc2\xa0 Violence in any form should stop immediately, and grievances should be addressed.\xc2\xa0 We will monitor what is and what has happened and future events as we undertake a review of our assistance posture.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That sounds to me like a warning.\xc2\xa0 If they don\xe2\x80\x99t improve their behavior their assistance will be terminated.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that if -- I think we are watching very closely the actions of the government, of the police, of all the security forces, and all of those in the military.\xc2\xa0 That their actions may affect our assistance would be the subject of that review.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go ahead -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Jackie, do you have something?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if you could give us any new information you have about the composition of the protesters.\xc2\xa0 You know, how much of it is and what proportion of it is Muslim Brotherhood or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me see if I can get some guidance on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we have -- look, I think you have seen over the past several days the manifestation of these grievances express themselves in protests by I think what you would consider to be the Egyptian middle class in the very base concerns that they have about their political reform needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any update on that.\xc2\xa0 I can check and see if there is anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I have a change of address, change of subject?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, stay on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My guess is that this is the predominant subject, but let me -- I\'ll come back at the end of this and see if -- yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any thought that what went on in Tunisia had some impact on this in terms of timing?\xc2\xa0 And do you fear that any sparks from the violence in Egypt might affect any other Arab countries?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past couple of days, I don\'t want to generalize across the region.\xc2\xa0 Countries are, obviously, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, at different stages in development politically.\xc2\xa0 But I think it is safe to say that we are monitoring events throughout the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk a bit about the involvement of the Muslim Brotherhood in this?\xc2\xa0 And should the Muslim Brotherhood be treated as a political party with privileges appertaining to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not think this is a -- I do not think that the grievances of the people of Egypt are of a monolithic political belief.\xc2\xa0 I think that it is well documented, and we have documented it, the grievances of those who feel they lack the basic individual rights that we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- that we enjoy and that we have enumerated over the past several days.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is -- we are not in touch with the Muslim Brotherhood.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you at all concerned about the increased role that the Muslim Brotherhood might play in Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s political situation as a result?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into forecasting in a very fluid and dynamic situation what may happen.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to what I said to Peter in that I think that it would be a -- based on what we know, a misinterpretation to believe that the events that we have seen are based on the beliefs of one -- just one set of people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Margaret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 To clarify on the ongoing aid question that keeps popping up, most of the aid to Egypt is military aid, right?\xc2\xa0 So when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about aid being reviewed, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about us reviewing our military aid assistance to them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I want to be clear that the review would be -- we\xe2\x80\x99d review all of our aid to Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And I think with -- I would say, within that review is military.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And is that review currently ongoing, or are you sort of waiting until things chill a little bit to figure that out?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just say it\xe2\x80\x99s been discussed and we are monitoring events that could affect that aid.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other quick follow-ups.\xc2\xa0 Does this affect our physical military posture in the region in any way that you could share with us today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In what way?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whatever -- U.S. military positioning.\xc2\xa0 Do we have concerns where we would need to become involved and reposition U.S. forces in any way?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, we discussed embassy security and we discussed -- and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that there have always been contingency plans for both embassy security and American citizens that are in both Egypt and in many countries throughout the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- we\xe2\x80\x99re confined to talking about embassies?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s all I would talk about publicly, that\'s for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about China?\xc2\xa0 It seems like a leap, and geographically it is, and culturally it is, but when President Hu was here there was a lot of discussion about human rights and about the need as you become more powerful to consider elements of free society or rule of law.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. believe -- or do you think that China should be concerned in any way about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Egypt?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- they\'re such completely different societies and that this is mostly an Arab-Muslim thing at this point?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me make sure I understand.\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about our posture toward China or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the notion of citizens around the world in societies with --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that don\'t feel are open enough deciding to take to the streets?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- again, I think it would be -- if I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to generalize across a region, I probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t generalize across several regions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to know about one country, not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I understand.\xc2\xa0 But to discuss this as it relates to one other country would be to do -- would be to dip my toe into the pool of generalization, which I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not going to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the issues that the President talked with President Hu of China about and the issues with which President Hu told all of you that there was work to be done, that is the case regardless of what happens in any other country in the world.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President has expressed his concerns about that, and I think you saw those concerns quite honestly expressed by President Hu.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that this situation or the free and fair elections you\xe2\x80\x99re calling for could produce a government that\xe2\x80\x99s less favorable to U.S. interests?\xc2\xa0 And is that a price that you are willing to pay for those universal rights to be upheld?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me be -- I want to reiterate.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to project into the future.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that would be a wise use of my time given the fluidity of events.\xc2\xa0 I think this is -- the government of Egypt will be -- is an issue for the people of Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Looking at the seriousness of the situation, who is the person you are in touch with in Cairo?\xc2\xa0 You say the Presidents have not spoken.\xc2\xa0 In all these answers I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find with whom are you in touch -- except the ambassador -- in the Mubarak administration.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We are in touch with -- again, I don\'t have a list of every conversation that\'s been had.\xc2\xa0 We are in touch with the Egyptian government throughout entities in this building and throughout this administration.\xc2\xa0 The Pentagon is obviously in touch with the military.\xc2\xa0 The State Department is in touch with -- directly with the government and in touch with the Foreign Ministry.\xc2\xa0 Again, there are conversations that are had in many different buildings and at many different levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have repeatedly said that the U.S. is urging for reform in Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But concretely what types of reforms are you urging for?\xc2\xa0 And also, is this realistic, I mean, given that the same regime has been in power there for 30 years?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- I outlined a couple of things yesterday and repeated them today the types of things that we certainly would envision.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think -- and I repeat those -- obviously, I mentioned free and fair elections, I mentioned our condemnation of the extension of emergency law, and that that should be ended.\xc2\xa0 But the grievances of the people have to be addressed directly by the government, and I think there has to be a significant and thorough dialogue to address, again, a whole host of individual rights that the people rightly believe are lacking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think there has to be a concrete process that involves -- and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- would not be something that would be only enumerated from our perspective.\xc2\xa0 It has to be enumerated and addressed directly from the perspective of those in Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the moment, this is the story -- the whole world is watching -- in a similar way like a few years ago, the whole world was watching Georgia or the Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 At the time, it seemed that there was some international approach to it.\xc2\xa0 Now, this is happening already one week, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell us that the President or the White House is in contact, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, with the most important three or four western allies to develop a strategy, a common strategy, in how to react to Egypt?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, first and foremost, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re watching a series of events that are rapidly unfolding and changing.\xc2\xa0 I have no doubt that things may well have changed in the time in which I\xe2\x80\x99ve stood up here.\xc2\xa0 Again, we have a very robust -- we have very robust diplomatic efforts.\xc2\xa0 And we have contacts and conversations, as I said earlier, in many buildings in this administration, with entities throughout the world.\xc2\xa0 The President has not made specific calls on this at this point.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to monitor the situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you need a common strategy of the West -- I mean, the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We need a strategy by the Egyptian government to address the grievances of the Egyptian people.\xc2\xa0 I think the world -- and I think several leaders have expressed the same -- the very same concerns about violence that the President, the Secretary of State, and others have addressed, the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 I think that the basic and universal rights that have to be reformed -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty common response and reaction to the images that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Much of the demonstration in the last few days seems to focus on President Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s apparent attempt to have his son, Gamal Mubarak, succeed him in the elections this year, one way or another.\xc2\xa0 Now, you said the President has talked about basic human rights and non-violence in past conversations with President Mubarak.\xc2\xa0 Has he ever discussed what many feel is a dynastic succession bid?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a direct answer to that.\xc2\xa0 And let me see if there\xe2\x80\x99s some guidance on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you following the reports about the whereabouts of Gamal Mubarak at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring the events of the entire situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 During the meetings today, was the scenario or the possibility of Mubarak being toppled ever discussed or entertained?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not in meetings that I was in.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it is safe to say, without getting into a level of detail or granularity, that we are watching a situation that obviously changes day to day.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to watch and make preparations for a whole host of scenarios.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, for a long time Egypt has been a partner in Middle East peace efforts.\xc2\xa0 I know you said the President has not spoken with other world leaders, but on what level is the administration communicating with Israel and how might all this affect the Middle East peace agreement?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of every conversation that\xe2\x80\x99s happened.\xc2\xa0 But I think it is safe to say that our -- both inside of here and at the State Department, they have talked throughout the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one on another topic?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s exhaust this before we -- yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. -- or excuse me, is Egypt in danger of losing its U.S. financial assistance?\xc2\xa0 Is that -- are they in jeopardy of losing that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I think the review is based upon their actions.\xc2\xa0 The people -- let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, the people of Egypt are watching the government\xe2\x80\x99s actions.\xc2\xa0 They have for quite some time, and their grievances have reached a boiling point.\xc2\xa0 And they have to be addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We will watch the actions of government.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll reiterate the urging of restraint for the security forces and for the military.\xc2\xa0 All of that will go into that review.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will there be a decision?\xc2\xa0 Is there a point when you have to make a decision about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing review, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an end date.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand your answer about Vodafone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My answer was I was going to take that question and see if there was any other specific information -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on that, and I will try to gather it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because, I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re a company in the U.K. --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That part I did know.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It was --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you not urge them to switch service back on?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, I think -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear -- we have been very clear.\xc2\xa0 The President was clear on this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of State was clear on this today.\xc2\xa0 P.J. and I have both spoken on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We believe in the basket of individual freedoms includes the freedom to access the Internet and the freedom to use social networking sites.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to speak about the specific company because I need a little bit more information.\xc2\xa0 Regardless of any situation, we believe that the people of Egypt have a right to freedom of expression and freedom of speech, and that includes the use of the Internet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think what the concern is that what\xe2\x80\x99s coming across is that you\xe2\x80\x99re tempering your concern with --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just be clear -- can I be clear?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that I could say that would be more clear than that the people of Egypt have -- should and have full access to social networking sites and the Internet; that the people of Egypt should have their concerns about freedom of expression, assembly and association addressed directly by their government?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not tempering one word or one syllable of one word in what has to be done by the people -- by the government of Egypt to address the concerns of the people of Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even if that means that the government were to fall?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I could be clearer.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the people of Egypt could be clearer.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve reached a point where the grievances of those have to be addressed in concrete reforms.\xc2\xa0 Have to.\xc2\xa0 Must.\xc2\xa0 Unequivocal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you said that the administration is reviewing the assistance posture.\xc2\xa0 On what criteria is that review being hinged?\xc2\xa0 What are the criteria?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The events that we\xe2\x80\x99re watching.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken several times --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, go ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, did you have one?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And there has not been direct contact between the two heads of state.\xc2\xa0 Is that because Mubarak is unwilling or unavailable for that contact?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken several times about how you\xe2\x80\x99re watching the events that are fluid.\xc2\xa0 Is there any interest of the President to intervene and use his influence to change the course of those events to quell the violence?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he -- I think that was apparent in what he said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he was clear on what the government shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do and he was clear on what the government needed to do.\xc2\xa0 I think the Secretary of State has been clear on that.\xc2\xa0 I think the Vice President has been clear on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you have a follow-up on something -- let\xe2\x80\x99s do a couple more, and then I\'ll --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 The one is in connection with Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Ever since the presidential visit to India in November, if President has spoken with the Prime Minister of India, as India just celebrated the Republic Day of India?\xc2\xa0 Indian Prime Minister is also worried about the events in Egypt because of the good relations with India and also the hundreds of thousands of Indians there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President, to my knowledge, has not spoken with Prime Minister Singh.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, as far as presidential address to the union the other day, it came to surprise around the globe, the people were surprised when the President said that China is now head of super-computer once the U.S. lost the leader, and also in solar power.\xc2\xa0 What people are asking now if China has compromised the U.S. security as far as leading in super-computers and all --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 I think -- let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 We, as the President said in his speech, need to take important steps to win the future.\xc2\xa0 We need to out-innovate and out-build and out-educate any of our competitors.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think people should be confused about the size of our economy and the size of their economy.\xc2\xa0 Our economy is three times the size of the Chinese economy, with a quarter of its people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, we need to take steps, because as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say a number of times, people in one state in this country aren\xe2\x80\x99t competing against people the next town over or two states away.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a global economy and we have global challenges, and I think the President addressed and outlined many of them, and over the course of the coming weeks and months we\xe2\x80\x99ll outline specific plans to address them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam, and then George.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I just want to -- could you just talk real quick about Jay, what he brings to the position, what differences we\xe2\x80\x99ll see?\xc2\xa0 And what sort of -- I guess if there\xe2\x80\x99s a message that comes with --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, let me just -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll do this quickly, because I -- get back to the situation in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, I think Jay is tremendously smart.\xc2\xa0 I think Jay is extraordinarily hard-working.\xc2\xa0 He has done a terrific job for the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 I think you need two things to do this job well.\xc2\xa0 I think you need to have the confidence of the President and the team in the White House, and you need to have the access, which gives you the ability to do the job and answer questions.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt that Jay has each of those abilities, and I think will be terrific at what he does.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 George.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually, that was what I was going to ask.\xc2\xa0 But let me -- two follow-ups -- are you any closer, now that the announcements have been made, on saying when you\xe2\x80\x99ll hand over the duties to him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I anticipate transitioning out of here sometime in mid-February.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, secondly, can you explain the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking at all, beyond the two things you just named, in being the first President to name a -- since Gerald Ford to name a reporter to the job?\xc2\xa0 Does he have -- some skill in there he thinks is transferable?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A thousand jokes just flashed in my head, George.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cSkills?\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the -- I think given the nature of this briefing, I should probably holster each of those thousand jokes and we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss this later.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can we get another gaggle on this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
