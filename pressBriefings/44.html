Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t**Please see below for an addendum to the transcript, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t1:27 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\'s nice to see all of you.\xc2\xa0 For those of you who traveled to Asia, welcome back. Before we get started with questions today, I do have a couple remarks I\'d like to make at the top about the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Elkhart, Indiana tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tMany of you know that the President is going to return to Elkhart, Indiana tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Elkhart is, after all, the city that President Obama visited first after assuming the presidency.\xc2\xa0 And during his visit to Elkhart, Indiana back in 2009, President Obama promised that if we worked together we could pull that community and this country out of the depths of recession and put ourselves on a better, stronger course.\xc2\xa0 More than seven years after that visit, and despite near unanimous obstruction from Republicans in Congress, that\'s exactly what we\'ve done.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ve got a couple of charts here that I think will illustrate that progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve cut the unemployment rate in half from a peak of -- nationwide, we\'ve cut the unemployment rate in half from a peak of 10 percent during the recession to just 5 percent today.\xc2\xa0 And Elkhart, as you can see behind me, the unemployment rate quadrupled during the crisis, peaking at 19.6 percent.\xc2\xa0 Today that rate is down to right around 4 percent.\xc2\xa0 At the peak of the housing crisis in 2010, 9.5 percent of mortgages in Elkhart were late or in the process of foreclosure.\xc2\xa0 Today that percentage is down to 3.7, lower than pre-crisis levels.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve seen similar trends all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mean Indiana, not Elkhart, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe that this is a statistic that applies to Elkhart, but we can double-check that for you *[The label on the graphic is correct: 9.5 percent of mortgages in Indiana were late or in the process of foreclosure in 2009].</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the manufacturing sector, this obviously is something that is critically important to the local economy in Elkhart.\xc2\xa0 Manufacturing employment has rebounded and domestic auto production has doubled since the crisis.\xc2\xa0 Elkhart\xe2\x80\x99s iconic RV industry is leading that trend and is set to break an all-time production record this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the United States and Elkhart, high school graduation rates have risen to their highest level on record.\xc2\xa0 In Elkhart, the graduation rate has reached nearly 90 percent, up from just 75 percent in 2008.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat ties all this together, of course, is the President\xe2\x80\x99s work to enact the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 And the Recovery Act laid the foundation for many of the trends that we just walked through, with $170 million in critical investments in infrastructure and education in Elkhart alone, alongside additional support for the hardest-hit families through expanded unemployment insurance and Medicaid, as well as tax cuts for the middle class and for working families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of this contributed to the kind of economic recovery that the private sector has led all across the country, and is a testament to the hard work and tenacity and ambition of business owners and employees and middle-class workers in the Elkhart community.\xc2\xa0 Elkhart is, in fact, a symbol of America\xe2\x80\x99s recovery. And that\'s why, as the American people begin to think more about the very real choice they have in November, the President chose to return to Elkhart to make a forceful case for the policies that have helped communities like Elkhart recover and to talk about how we can build on that success in the months and years ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it should make for a pretty interesting event tomorrow. And hopefully many of you will be able to travel with us as we make the visit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, with that, Kathleen, we can go to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just stick with Elkhart because it seems like this looks like something like a victory lap.\xc2\xa0 But I would suggest the President\xe2\x80\x99s polls or approval rating in Elkhart probably don\'t match some of these stats.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering if you have any explanation for why you feel the President isn\'t getting credit for this kind of economic --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think inherent in our political process are politicians who seek to claim credit for themselves so they can win reelection.\xc2\xa0 President Obama is not running for reelection.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is he implemented these policies in early 2009 because he thought they would help the economy, not because he thought they would have a positive impact on his approval rating.\xc2\xa0 In fact, many of the policies that President Obama implemented were almost unanimously opposed by Republicans. Some of the policies were even opposed by some Democrats.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, the rescue of the American auto industry is something that has had a profound impact on communities like Elkhart throughout the industrial Midwest.\xc2\xa0 Outside economists have estimated that a million jobs were saved because the American auto industry was rescued.\xc2\xa0 It was on the brink of total collapse, but because of the policy decisions that were implemented by the Obama administration, we now see that the American auto industry is even stronger than before.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that\'s a testament to the fact that the President was not committed to making decisions based on what impact they would have on his approval rating but rather what impact they would have on the economy.\xc2\xa0 And I think the results speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI guess to try to answer your question more directly, I think the President does believe, while he is not particularly concerned in accepting credit for himself, he does believe it\'s important for the American people to understand what sort of policies have made our recovery possible.\xc2\xa0 The President, time and time again, has made clear that it\'s the private sector who led our recovery; that the determination and commitment of the American people and business owners and workers all across the country to scratch and claw out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, it\'s the American people who deserve credit for our recovery.\xc2\xa0 But that recovery would not have been possible without the federal government making smart decisions to invest in the middle class, to invest in those aspects of our economy that are critical to our longer-term success.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat includes the manufacturing sector.\xc2\xa0 That includes research and development.\xc2\xa0 That includes clean energy.\xc2\xa0 It also includes an investment in middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the Recovery Act included more than a dozen tax cuts for small businesses.\xc2\xa0 It included a significant tax cut for middle-class families and those families that are working hard to get into the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\'s important for the American people to understand exactly what policies created this opportunity, because that\'s the way to evaluate whether or not the government responded appropriately to the previous economic downturn.\xc2\xa0 And we know that there are going to be challenges that future governments have to confront, and it\'s important for people to understand exactly what led us out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression so that when future governments have to make a decision that they can draw on relevant evidence about what worked last time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, why exactly does the White House think he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get credit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are probably -- I think there are a variety of explanations for that, and I suspect many of you will write about them in the next 24 hours.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And I think certainly some of it goes back to what I said before about the remarkable and almost unanimous Republican obstruction to many of the solutions that President Obama has proposed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, there\xe2\x80\x99s a tendency on the part of some outside commentators to essentially want to look for a way to spike the football -- because I think the results are pretty resounding in terms of the wisdom of the approach that President Obama pursued -- but President Obama also understands that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of important work that still remains to be done.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still more work that we could do to invest in our infrastructure to ensure the long-term success of our country.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still more work that we can do to put upward pressure on wages.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still more work that we can do to reduce inequality.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress on each of those measures, but the President is not content with the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made thus far.\xc2\xa0 He understands that his successor will have some important decisions to make about whether or not we are going to build on this progress, are we going to build on this momentum, or are we going to tear it down.\xc2\xa0 And there is a pretty clear choice to be made if you take a look at the policies that are being advocated by the two parties.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one more on that.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think there\xe2\x80\x99s any chance the Democratic nominee could win Indiana?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I keep going back to this example because it\xe2\x80\x99s such a resonant one -- but in late May of 2008, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there was a lot of optimism among Democrats that the Democratic nominee would eventually win that state in the general election, but, of course, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what then Senator Obama did in 2008.\xc2\xa0 So it certainly is not out of the realm of possibility that Democrats could win it once again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, that will be part of a debate for the individual campaigns to engage in.\xc2\xa0 President Obama will deliver his remarks tomorrow mindful of the political backdrop for his speech, but the focus of his remarks will be on the results of the policies that he implemented early in his presidency.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to turn to the Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s report on Clinton -- on Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s email.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a chance to offer some reaction.\xc2\xa0 It was clear that she did not -- even though she said that she -- acknowledged the situation was approved, that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t seek approval.\xc2\xa0 She never demonstrated that her BlackBerry met minimum requirements -- security information requirements.\xc2\xa0 Does the President still stand by the statement that he\xe2\x80\x99s certain that Clinton did not endanger national security?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President does -- the President certainly stands by what he said in the past on this.\xc2\xa0 When the President was given the opportunity to talk about this in Asia, he referred questions to Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\xc2\xa0 They can obviously discuss the decisions that she made as Secretary of State as they relate to her use of email.\xc2\xa0 I think the focus of the White House has been on the institutional questions that have been raised about the way in which the State Department manages its records and manages its email system.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd based on the report of the Inspector General, this is a report that was solicited specifically by the current Secretary of State, John Kerry.\xc2\xa0 But according to this report, there were eight specific recommendations that the Inspector General put forward to the Department of State about steps they could take to ensure that proper record maintenance was being implemented.\xc2\xa0 And based on the IG\xe2\x80\x99s examination of the situation, all eight of those recommendations have now been resolved in terms of the State Department following through and actually implementing those recommendations that the Inspector General had put forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the Department of State is fulfilling their institutional responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 That certainly is consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to transparency and competence.\xc2\xa0 But for your more specific question about Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s use of email, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to her able spokesman.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the White House think that she should have participated -- or cooperated in that IG investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team for how she handled those questions.\xc2\xa0 I think what is clear from the IG is that they took a broad look at what the Department of State needs to do to make sure that they are in compliance with sort of the relevant rules, but also to make sure that they are handling these records in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate and consistent with the commitment that the President has placed on government transparency.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the Inspector General had eight recommendations, all of which have now been implemented by the Department of State.</p>\n<p>\n\tTim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Turning to North Korea, another missile test.\xc2\xa0 Kind of unusual to do another test of a missile after three failures in April.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think there are a number of things that are unusual about North Korea, Tim.\xc2\xa0 But this would certainly be one of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any thinking on why these rollouts keep continuing even though they tend to be duds?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start by saying that the United States and the rest of the international community calls on North Korea to refrain from actions, including this failed missile test, that further raise tensions in the region, and focus instead on taking concrete steps toward fulfilling its international commitments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States strongly condemns North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s missile test, in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, which explicitly prohibit North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s use of ballistic missile technology.\xc2\xa0 These actions and North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s continued pursuit of ballistic missile and nuclear weapons capabilities pose a significant threat to the United States, our allies, and to the stability of the Asia Pacific region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI can tell you that U.S. Strategic Command systems detected what we assess was a failed North Korean intermediate-range ballistic missile launch yesterday afternoon from North Korea.\xc2\xa0 NORAD conducted their own assessment and determined that the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President had the opportunity to discuss in Asia steps that the United States has taken in coordination with our allies and our partners in that region of the world to confront North Korea and their ballistic missile program that is in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\xc2\xa0 The President also discussed some of the steps that the United States military has undertaken on his orders to strengthen our defenses in that region of the world, both to protect our allies in Asia, but also to protect the American people back here at home.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to have confidence in the steps that the military has taken to protect the American people and to protect our allies.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly would like to see North Korea begin to take steps that are consistent with the pursuit of compliance with its international obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the White House thinking behind what North Korea is doing here?\xc2\xa0 Even China criticizing --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a renewed assessment to offer in terms of what the leader of North Korea may be contemplating at this point, but what is clear is that the international community does agree that what North Korea is doing is a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that they should stop doing.\xc2\xa0 And as a result of North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on pursuing this approach, the North Korean government has been increasingly isolated and they\xe2\x80\x99re under increasing pressure, economically, as a result of the coordinated actions of the international community.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe obviously are hopeful that that pressure will lead to some different strategic decisions being made by the North Korean government.\xc2\xa0 But thus far it has not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Turning to Fallujah, the Norwegian Refugee Council -- it\'s one of the organizations displaced from the city -- has said that a human catastrophe is unfolding there as residents are stuck in the city.\xc2\xa0 To what extent does the White House agree with that assessment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have my own assessment to offer from here.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the international community has been deeply concerned about the citizens of Fallujah for a couple years now. And that concern is rooted in the willingness of ISIL terrorists to use violence to try to subjugate the local population. \xc2\xa0And what the Iraqi government and Iraqi forces have undertaken is an effort to try to liberate the city.\xc2\xa0 And they do so mindful of the need to live up to a standard of respecting basic universal human rights.\xc2\xa0 And we do believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Iraqi forces, as they undertake these operations and as they seek to liberate the city, that they\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of the needs of the local population.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter all, many of the efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99ve undertaken, both in Iraq and in Syria, have been part of trying to free up some space for the delivery of humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s not possible in a city like Fallujah that is controlled by ISIL, but the need for humanitarian assistance once the city is liberated is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been mindful of.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, President Obama spent some time in meeting with his G7 counterparts last week in Japan in discussing financial assistance that can be provided by the international community to residents of cities in Iraq that have been liberated from ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe understand that these communities have been decimated, their infrastructure has been, in many cases, destroyed, and the civilian population has gone through a terrible ordeal.\xc2\xa0 And the truth of the matter is the economic weakness that we see in Iraq doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow the Iraqi government to deploy as many resources as they would like to try to address that situation and rebuild these communities, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve benefited significantly from broad international support for those efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99d also point out that within the last couple of weeks the IMF has announced a significant package of financial assistance that they\xe2\x80\x99ll provide the Iraqi people and the Iraqi government in pursuit of the same kinds of goals.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re all very mindful of the devastating humanitarian impact of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s violence.\xc2\xa0 That, after all, is the leading motivator for the international community to come together and try to drive them out of these cities and ultimately destroy that organization.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fallujah is obviously a huge test for the Iraqi military.\xc2\xa0 To what extent would the administration have preferred to hold off on Fallujah and instead keep concentrating on preparations for Mosul?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have said all along, Tim, is that these kinds of operational decisions will be made by the Iraqi government and Iraqi forces.\xc2\xa0 After all, the focus of the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy is to build up the capacity of local forces and local authorities to provide for the security situation in their own country.\xc2\xa0 And that includes taking the fight to ISIL in their own country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the United States and the rest of the international community is supporting the Iraqi central government and certainly looking for ways to offer our support and assistance to those forces that are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re doing in this instance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we certainly do believe that this offensive against Fallujah is something that will allow us to make important progress against ISIL, but we also acknowledge that this is something that\'s going to be a tough fight.\xc2\xa0 This is going to take some time.\xc2\xa0 And it will be a test of the determination and tenacity of Iraqi forces.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve shown that determination and tenacity and resilience on the battlefield in making progress against ISIL in places like Anbar Province and Ramadi.\xc2\xa0 But that will certainly be a challenge to display those qualities in the long fight to retake Fallujah.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, we\'re about to head into June, which is Pride Month for the LGBT community.\xc2\xa0 The President is said to host a Pride Reception at the White House on June 9th, but how do you anticipate generally the President will observe the occasion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to announce yet about the President\'s June schedule.\xc2\xa0 But as you point out, the President has in the past hosted receptions like the one that you describe that\'s set for next week.\xc2\xa0 I think the President obviously is quite proud of the important progress that our country has made over the last seven years when it comes to greater equality for LGBT Americans.\xc2\xa0 And the President is certainly interested in looking for ways to continue to build on that progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The administration is conducting listening sessions on designating a national monument in honor of the 1969 Stonewall riots.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s speculation that it would be announced in time for June of this year.\xc2\xa0 When will the President pull the trigger on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on any potential presidential designations, but we\'ll obviously keep you posted on any developments that might be of interest to you.\xc2\xa0 I suspect that might be one of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a number of cities are hosting Pride celebrations and parades, including D.C., which is hosting its parade on June 11th.\xc2\xa0 Would you rule out the possibility that President Obama this month would participate in an LGBT Pride Parade?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware that that\'s on the President\'s schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to go back to Indiana first.\xc2\xa0 I know that you outlined some of the positive signs, but I think for a lot of people, Indiana has been kind of symbolic of some of the downsides of the Obama economy.\xc2\xa0 A majority of both Democrats and Republicans in the state, when they went to the polls last month, said that the economy was their top concern.\xc2\xa0 Donald Trump obviously got a lot of traction by pointing out that Carrier was laying off hundreds of people in the state to send those jobs to Mexico as a part of free-trade policies that the President has championed.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering how you respond to that and whether the way that the President\'s economic policies have played out have created a vulnerability that the next Democratic nominee is going to have to grapple with, since you\'ve kind of opened the fact that this a campaign backdrop.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me answer that question a couple of ways.\xc2\xa0 The first is, I think that when you take a look at the basic economic measurements in terms of evaluating the impact of the President\'s policies on Indiana, there\'s no denying how the people of Indiana have benefited from decisions that President Obama made.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s true whether you look at the housing market, or look at the manufacturing sector, or you look at the broader unemployment rate.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think the other way that I would answer your question is to acknowledge that the economic forces of globalization are powerful and they are having an impact on communities all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And the question really for the American people and for voters who go to the polls in November is what do you think is the most effective strategy for dealing with it.\xc2\xa0 And the President has pursued an approach that prioritizes growing our economy from the middle out.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that if we are focused on what\'s in the best interest of middle-class families all across the country, we\'re likely to see the kinds of economic results that are positive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let\'s talk about the question of trade, for instance.\xc2\xa0 And I know that this has been the subject of some debate not just in campaigns but in politics now for a number of years.\xc2\xa0 I\'m reluctant to get into the decisions made by any individual company, but I think what is true about the decision that was made by Carrier is it\'s not that different than the decision than we\'ve seen by other manufacturing entities in the United States. And again, those are decisions, some of which actually even predate President Obama\'s election to the presidency.\xc2\xa0 The point is this:\xc2\xa0 These are longer-running trends, and President Obama has put forward a very specific strategy for dealing with it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, in some ways, I think the impact on Indiana is a useful illustration.\xc2\xa0 The Carrier plant that you refer to is, according to the announcement made by that company, actually going to be relocated to Mexico.\xc2\xa0 Mexico is a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xc2\xa0 That is a trade agreement that has not yet been ratified through the United States Congress.\xc2\xa0 And there are Democrats and Republicans who have both said that the movement of this plan is evidence of how damaging free trade is to the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the question is, are you just going to bemoan that fact, and bemoan the fact that there are manufacturing jobs that are leaving Indiana as a result of this decision by Carrier, or are you actually going to do something about it?\xc2\xa0 And President Obama has pursued a strategy for actually doing something about it -- by completing a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that includes Canada and Mexico, that effectively does renegotiate NAFTA, that will put in place higher and enforceable labor and environmental standards.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President talked quite a bit when he was in Asia about how the agreement also includes higher and enforceable intellectual property standards.\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of -- and the effect of this, of those standards being included in the agreement, is that it starts to level the playing field.\xc2\xa0 Right now, there is a competitive and unfair advantage that places like Mexico have when it comes to labor conditions in that country.\xc2\xa0 But the Trans-Pacific Partnership, by signing on to it, Mexico is going to be in a position where they have to start meeting higher standards.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s starting to level the playing field for American businesses and American workers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\'s going to prevent every job from moving overseas.\xc2\xa0 But it does mean that we\'ll actually be putting some pressure on Mexico and other countries that sign on to the TPP to level that playing field, to give American businesses and American workers here in the United States a better opportunity to compete -- not just as it relates to where to locate their operations, but also in terms of doing business.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States will now also have better access to customers in Mexico and Canada and other places throughout the Asia Pacific.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good thing for the U.S. economy, too.\xc2\xa0 Overall, the Trans-Pacific Partnership would actually cut 18,000 taxes that other countries place on American goods.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the President\'s strategy for confronting these powerful forces of economic globalization.\xc2\xa0 And that, I think, is a strategy that is certainly more specific and one that shows more promise than anything that\'s being articulated by critics of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator McCain has proposed an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill that would boost OCO funding by $19 billion.\xc2\xa0 So this is different from the House version because rather than back-filling it, it would just be an increase, but not have to deal with the sequester caps.\xc2\xa0 You guys have bemoaned using OCO for sort of regular defense spending before.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering if you would at all be open to a plan like this.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m also wondering if it\'s still kind of a veto red line for the President that any increase in the defense spending would --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say at the outset that I have not seen Senator McCain\'s specific proposal.\xc2\xa0 I will note that Senator McCain himself has been previously critical of budget gimmicks that essentially fund regular defense spending through overseas contingency operation budgets.\xc2\xa0 So, presumably, his own proposal is consistent with his own previously expressed views on this.\xc2\xa0 I just haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen his specific proposal, so we\'ll take a look at it.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt certainly is the President\'s expectation that the budget agreement that was signed last year -- and that was a two-year budget agreement -- that Republicans and Democrats in Congress would live up to the commitments that they made in the context of that budget agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric Holder said in a podcast over the weekend that Edward Snowden had performed a public service by leaking documents about the classified NSA\'s program, while criticizing his methods.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if the President agrees with that assessment.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has had the opportunity to speak on this a number of times, and I think a careful review of his public comments would indicate that he does not.\xc2\xa0 Everybody here at the White House who had the opportunity to work with Attorney General Holder certainly respects his work, certainly respects his knowledge and view of the law.\xc2\xa0 And I would point out that even Mr. Holder pointed out in that interview, "He\'s broken the law.\xc2\xa0 In my view, he needs to get lawyers, come on back and decide what he wants to do -- go to trial, try to cut a deal.\xc2\xa0 I think there has to be a consequence for what he has done."</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat Mr. Holder is articulating there is the view of the administration, which is specifically that Mr. Snowden has been charged with serious crimes.\xc2\xa0 He should return to the United States.\xc2\xa0 He should be afforded due process. \xc2\xa0And that\'s essentially how the situation should be handled.\xc2\xa0 But Mr. Snowden has not done so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Mitch McConnell, in an interview today, said that he expects an agreement on Zika funding soon.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if the White House shares his optimism that an agreement will be coming soon, and if the package that\'s shaping up on the Hill is something that you guys are okay with, because it will likely be less than the $1.9 billion that you\'ve requested.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that $1.9 billion request was actually one that was put forward by our public health professionals, so that is certainly what we believe that Congress should act on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut congressional action is long overdue.\xc2\xa0 And we have lost an opportunity over the last three or four months here to get ahead of a potentially significant problem.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And every day that goes by, even while Congress is on recess, is another day that\'s lost to preparing to protect the country from the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly would hope that Congress would act quickly to move forward on the funding request that the administration has put forward to ensure we\'re doing everything that we could possibly do to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is a budget request that was put together and is strongly supported by our public health professionals.\xc2\xa0 This is a budget request that Democratic and Republican governors across the country have advocated in favor of.\xc2\xa0 So we need to see some congressional action here.\xc2\xa0 And so hopefully Leader McConnell was right.</p>\n<p>\n\tNadia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to Fallujah. What does the U.S. think of the Iranian role there?\xc2\xa0 A report that Qassim Suleimani was playing a part in liberating the city. Do you think this plays into ISIS\xe2\x80\x99s hands, especially that the Iranians are playing a big part?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the United States has long said is that to allow the situation in Iraq to devolve into a sectarian conflict would only play into the hands of ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And this is not just a view that\'s been articulated by the United States and a concern that\'s been articulated by the United States, it\'s actually a concern that\'s been articulated by the other members of our counter-ISIL coalition and by Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors, including Iran.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, I\'ll let the Iranians speak for themselves, but I think it\'s pretty obvious that it is not in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s interest to have this sectarian bloodbath right on their border.\xc2\xa0 They understand that that would only empower ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that they\xe2\x80\x99re involved -- or at least interested in the outcome in Fallujah in the first place is because they don\'t want to see ISIL strengthened.\xc2\xa0 So they clearly understand -- the Iranians clearly understand the stakes here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the United States has been clear about what our approach will be.\xc2\xa0 Our approach will be to offer support and assistance to those forces that are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government.\xc2\xa0 Our insistence will be that those Iraqi forces operate consistent with basic humanitarian obligations and that they do so respectful of the population that they\xe2\x80\x99re seeing to liberate.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have made that case, not just because of our commitment to those values and a high standard that we have set when it comes to these kinds of moral questions, but also because of the basic understanding of what ISIL is seeking to do.\xc2\xa0 ISIL is seeking to sow sectarian conflict that will create the kind of chaos that allows them to grow and thrive.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re certainly mindful of that risk, but I think other countries with an interest in defeating ISIL also recognize that risk.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would you say that you would -- any coordination, whether direct or indirect, with the Iranian forces, since both the U.S. and Iran are assisting the Iraqi security forces?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any leverage whatsoever on the Iranians or the Iraqi government to say -- or to illustrate what you just mentioned, that this is not helpful in the long run?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have said here on many occasions that the United States does not plan -- or does not coordinate militarily with Iran.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not aware of any plan to start doing that.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s also true is the Iraqis themselves -- the Iraqi government understands that sectarian division and further sectarian conflict in their country is counterproductive.\xc2\xa0 After all, that\'s the reason the international community came together to support Prime Minister Abadi, because he promised to change from the kind of sectarian governing agenda that was pursued by his predecessor to pursue a governing agenda that\'s much more inclusive.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s faces some obstacles to implementing that agenda, but he\xe2\x80\x99s been aggressive in pursuing it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s why the United States has been strongly supportive of Prime Minister Abadi and his efforts.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the international community has stepped up in providing the financial assistance, both through the IMF but also through the G7.\xc2\xa0 And the international community is supportive of the Iraqi Prime Minister who\xe2\x80\x99s indicated that he understands that further sectarian conflict will not be beneficial to his country and certainly will not be beneficial in the fight against ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, Syrian activists are reporting that Russian airplanes have been hitting a hospital in northern Syria and 50 people dead.\xc2\xa0 Can you, first of all, confirm actually that it was the Russians who hit the hospital?\xc2\xa0 And this is the second incident, I believe, in a short period of time.\xc2\xa0 Do you still believe that the Russian motivation there is really fighting ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start by saying that I cannot confirm those reports.\xc2\xa0 Obviously I\'ve seen them and we are following up on those reports.\xc2\xa0 But if it is confirmed, this strike would be the latest in a series of strikes against medical facilities in Syria.\xc2\xa0 The international community needs to get to the bottom of this and those who are responsible for these threats need to be held accountable.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to take a look at these reports.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to Russia, we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to make clear that Russia needs to be onboard with implementing a Cessation of Hostilities. It means that they have specific obligations as it relates to their own activities, but it also means that it is incumbent upon them to use their influence with the Assad regime to get the Assad regime to abide by the Cessation of Hostilities.\xc2\xa0 And that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just mean in some particular corners of the country.\xc2\xa0 That means in every area that\xe2\x80\x99s covered by the Cessation of Hostilities, including communities like Aleppo, Latakia and Idlib.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the reasons that this Cessation of Hostilities is important and why it\xe2\x80\x99s important that this Cessation of Hostilities be implemented is it will allow for humanitarian access.\xc2\xa0 And in some of these communities, including some of the ones that I just discussed, the humanitarian situation is dire and there are basic humanitarian needs like food and water and medical supplies that are going unmet right now.\xc2\xa0 And the international community and the United States is deeply concerned about this.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe it important for the Russians to live up to their obligations so that this humanitarian relief can be provided.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you a big part of the international community?\xc2\xa0 How are you going to make the Russians accountable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a number of procedures in place -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to pretend that this is easy, but it certainly has not been for a lack of engagement that our efforts to implement a Cessation of Hostilities across the country has not been as successful as we would like.\xc2\xa0 There have been places where we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the frustration -- the Cessation of Hostilities begin to fray, and that\xe2\x80\x99s been problematic.\xc2\xa0 And that has put innocent people in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0 And the United States remains determined in working with all parties, including the Russians, to remind them of their obligations that they signed onto under the Cessation of Hostilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The President-elect of the Philippines said earlier today that corrupt journalists are legitimate targets of assassination.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering your reaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, Olivier, the U.S. government and President Obama believe strongly in basic human rights, including freedom of the press.\xc2\xa0 That is a freedom that\xe2\x80\x99s enshrined in our Constitution.\xc2\xa0 But we do not believe that is a uniquely American value -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a universal human value.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama has, as he\xe2\x80\x99s traveled around the world, strongly made the case, both in private and in public, to world leaders about the need to protect basic press freedoms.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been true in places like Cuba and Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia, and even in Vietnam, where the President traveled just last week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a priority for the President whenever he travels around the world.\xc2\xa0 And he has not been shy about making a strong case about the importance of protecting professional journalists. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the case that he\xe2\x80\x99s made both publicly in high-profile settings, but also privately in his direct interactions with world leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a few times about the topic, and I\'m sorry if it\xe2\x80\x99s getting tedious, but the difference between an American serviceman being in combat versus having a combat mission -- are there objective criteria that lead you to label something a combat mission?\xc2\xa0 Or is that something that is just at the discretion of the President?\xc2\xa0 How does that work?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, Olivier, I think the best that I can do is just to try to provide you with sort of a layman\xe2\x80\x99s description of what the President has in mind.\xc2\xa0 I think for sort of a more technical definition you might try the Department of Defense -- maybe there are specific criteria that they have in mind.\xc2\xa0 But what I can do is try to provide you what the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking is as he explains what mission has been given to our men and women in uniform in Iraq and in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd actually, let me start by referring you to a document that I know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve closely read -- this is the proposal that the administration put forward for an AUMF more than a year ago. And included in this proposal was some language that I think is relevant to this discussion and it includes this -- I\xe2\x80\x99m quoting now -- \xe2\x80\x9cThe authorization I propose would provide the flexibility to conduct ground combat operations in other more limited circumstances, such as rescue operations involving U.S. or coalition personnel, or the use of Special Operations Forces to take military action against ISIL leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is in the AUMF, drawing a distinction between the mission that President Bush gave to our men and women in uniform at the beginning of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the mission that President Obama has given our men and women in uniform who are serving in Iraq right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur men and women who are serving in Iraq right now are doing so at great danger to themselves.\xc2\xa0 Serving in Iraq, serving in Syria is dangerous, and these are men and women who are putting themselves in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way on the orders of the Commander-in-Chief to benefit our national security.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly owe them a debt of gratitude.\xc2\xa0 We also should be candid about what mission they are given and what their responsibilities are and what risks they will assume, and what mission they have not been given.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has tried to describe in a variety of settings, and obviously our military pilots, for example, who are carrying out airstrikes against ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria, that\xe2\x80\x99s a dangerous situation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s also a combat situation.\xc2\xa0 But those are military pilots.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the ground, the goal of our forces on the ground has been to support local forces that are taking the fight to ISIL in their own country.\xc2\xa0 That means it is chiefly the responsibility of Iraqi security forces in Iraq, for example, to seek out and engage ISIL fighters and to drive them out of territory and to occupy it.\xc2\xa0 U.S. forces have been in a situation where they have provided training in advance to those Iraqi forces that are prepared to undertake that kind of mission.\xc2\xa0 They also occasionally will operate in a role that allows them to provide some advice and assistance, even in a dangerous situation, to enhance their ability to operate on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that has put U.S. forces in a dangerous situation in some circumstances.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why those forces, when they\xe2\x80\x99re deployed to Iraq, have been trained in combat and are armed for combat so that they can defend themselves accordingly.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to draw a clear distinction between the dangerous situation that our men and women in uniform face in Iraq and in Syria right now, and the mission that those men and women -- that our men and women in uniform were given in Iraq in 2003 by President Bush.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that distinction.\xc2\xa0 I think, though, for a lot of people, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard when you see American Special Operators rolling in Syria on tanks towards the front lines, that distinction gets really hard. And I saw in the \xe2\x80\x9cStars and Stripes\xe2\x80\x9d interview that people who were not laymen, like me, also feel a sense of concern about how you are defining this.\xc2\xa0 So I will reach out to the Pentagon, but this is something I want to talk to you more about.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, as it relates to the technical definition, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that my colleagues at the Department of Defense can help you with.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the same subject -- why not stay on that -- now that we are seeing two more U.S. soldiers badly injured -- one in Iraq, one in Syria -- so soon after we saw one soldier killed, I mean, you often say that it\xe2\x80\x99s a dangerous mission, but given what the mission is now and kind of how it\xe2\x80\x99s evolved, would you say that the mission is now getting more dangerous for U.S. soldiers that are over there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would describe it that way.\xc2\xa0 I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s been dangerous for U.S. forces in Iraq and in Syria for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And, look, when the President made the decision in late summer of 2014 to deploy U.S. forces to Iraq, those were forces that were undertaking an operation to ensure the safety and security of U.S. personnel in Iraq and that was dangerous work.\xc2\xa0 The President has also made the decision to allow U.S. forces to train Iraqi forces at some bases outside of Baghdad and Erbil.\xc2\xa0 That work has been dangerous, and the President has been concerned about the safety and security of American personnel that are operating there from the beginning.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve been mindful of the risk and it\xe2\x80\x99s been risky from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 But, again, what we have gone to great lengths to help both the American people understand but also our partners around the world understand -- this is not -- the United States cannot be in a situation where we are imposing a military solution on this problem.\xc2\xa0 This is a fight that the Iraqi people must wage for themselves in Iraq, and this is a fight that the Syrian people must wage for themselves in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that is the only way that we will find the kind of long-term solution that is in the interest of just about everybody involved.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given the situation and how it has changed with ISIS losing ground, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve said a number of times that ISIS will get more desperate as they start to lose territory and things like that, so as we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about offensives coming up and ISIS possibly continuing to lose territory -- won\xe2\x80\x99t even an advise-and-assist mission become more dangerous over time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I guess I would leave it to my colleagues at the Department of Defense to offer up that kind of operational assessment.\xc2\xa0 I think the assessment from here is that the work that has been done by our servicemembers in Iraq and in Syria has been dangerous from the beginning, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why we owe them a debt of gratitude in terms of the personal sacrifices that they are prepared to make for our national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what is also true is that the mission that they are carrying out on the orders of President Obama is a mission designed to bolster the capacity of Iraqi forces to take the fight to ISIL in their own country.\xc2\xa0 And that is different than the mission that more than 100,000 U.S. servicemembers were given by President Bush to invade Iraq, to seek out the enemy, and to occupy territory.\xc2\xa0 The differences here are significant both in terms of the number of U.S. forces involved but also in the responsibility that\xe2\x80\x99s being assumed by those individual forces.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s probably not different is that for both forces in 2003 and forces operating in Iraq in 2016 it\xe2\x80\x99s a dangerous situation, and those forces need to be prepared to defend themselves.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the men and women that President Obama sends into Iraq now are individuals who are armed for combat.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who have been trained for combat. And, unfortunately, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen situations where American servicemembers have been killed in combat because of the situation that they found themselves in.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been said many, many times now, though, by soldiers and former U.S. soldiers that not calling it a combat mission or not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- calling it something other than simply advise and assist diminishes the role that these soldiers are actually doing.\xc2\xa0 How would you respond to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would respond to that by saying on countless occasions we have made clear that the distinction that we are drawing is an effort to be as precise and as specific as possible with the American people, with the Iraqi people, and with our partners around the world about what exactly our military personnel are doing in Iraq and in Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat does not in any way diminish the sacrifice that they are making for our country.\xc2\xa0 It certainly does not diminish in any way the heroism and courage and professionalism that they have to show on a daily basis, both to protect themselves, to protect their partners and teammates, but also to accomplish the mission.\xc2\xa0 So we are deeply indebted to our men and women in uniform who are making extraordinary sacrifices and taking extraordinary risks to protect our country.\xc2\xa0 They\'re doing so on the orders of the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you that the Commander-in-Chief, as he described just yesterday at Arlington National Cemetery, is deeply respectful of that service and deeply indebted to the commitment that they have shown to their country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And just very quickly on the Eric Holder statements on Edward Snowden.\xc2\xa0 When he was talking about public service, he was referring only to it raising a debate about these programs.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House not agree that that was one maybe good thing that came out of that, or that that is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, not a service that was done by what he did?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Michelle, that concern that we have is that the information that revealed by Edward Snowden put the United States and certain U.S. officials in grave danger.\xc2\xa0 It endangered our national security.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s not just a statement that I have made; that is actually an assessment that has been reached by leaders in our intelligence community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact of the matter is, there is a path for whistleblowers to take if they have legitimate concerns about what they are seeing, particularly when it comes to handling classified, sensitive information.\xc2\xa0 And Mr. Snowden has been charged with serious crimes because he did not do that.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s our view that he should return to the United States, be offered due process, but that he should face those charges directly, in person, on American soil.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'ll just say more broadly, Michelle, that what\'s also true is President Obama came into office vowing to pursue reforms of many of these programs and much of the work to reform these programs was being discussed and, in some cases, was even initiated before anybody had ever heard of Edward Snowden.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, as you know, the French are convening a conference later this week to try to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.\xc2\xa0 There\'s reports that Secretary Kerry is planning to attend this.\xc2\xa0 Nevertheless, the Israelis have been opposed to this conference from the start, arguing that the way to find a solution to this is through bilateral talks between the two sides and not this kind of multiparty arrangement.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House support what the French are doing, or does the White House have some understanding of the reservations the Israelis have?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it has been the U.S. principle for quite some time -- not just under President Obama, but under previous Presidents -- that a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will only be generated by talks between the two parties. Ultimately, it\'s the two parties that will have to make the difficult decisions and, in some cases, sacrifices that will be required to make peace.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, the rest of the international community, including the United States, has long played an important role in trying to bring both sides to the table.\xc2\xa0 And the United States has used our influence in the international community to try to facilitate conversations and try to facilitate talks, and try to help the two sides identify potential common ground.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry has certainly invested a lot in that effort early in President Obama\'s second term.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there has long been a role for the international community to try to encourage both sides to pursue reconciliation and to try to bring an end to the conflict that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t just led to a lot of innocent lives in that particular region of the world, but has also fueled conflicts in the region for more than a generation now.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, as it relates to Secretary Kerry\'s travel and what his expectations are for the meeting, I\'d refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you are saying you support the idea behind the meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Support the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re endorsing the idea of holding this conference?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that I would do that.\xc2\xa0 I\'d refer you to the State Department to see what their specific view would be.\xc2\xa0 I think what I\'m merely observing is that the Israelis and Palestinians will resolve their differences when they sit down face-to-face and actually engage in constructive conversations about resolving their differences.\xc2\xa0 And there is a role for the international community to play in terms of encouraging both sides to contribute constructively to that process.\xc2\xa0 But nobody in the international community, including the United States, can make those difficult decisions for the parties.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, the parties themselves have to make those decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I have some questions on three different subjects.\xc2\xa0 Going back to Chris and Pride in June, President Obama was basically called the "rights President," advocating a voice\xc2\xa0 -- you know, the talks on equality for everyone.\xc2\xa0 Being President, he worked through his issues that he had.\xc2\xa0 As an outgoing President, as someone who\'s considered a "rights President," primarily starting from the issue of gay rights, what\'s the legacy of this President when it comes to the LGBT community?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I\'ll just say as a general matter that the President is enormously proud of the progress that our country has made over the last seven or eight years of becoming a more accepting society for LGBT Americans.\xc2\xa0 The President has long been a champion of equality and justice, and certainly we have seen that equality for LGBT Americans grow in the last seven or eight years.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the President\'s legacy is, though, is something that historians will have to determine.\xc2\xa0 And the President has still got another seven or eight months here in office that he\'s very focused on the task that he has at hand.\xc2\xa0 So for questions about legacy, it will be answered by historians many years from now, who will take a look at the progress that our country has made.\xc2\xa0 They\'ll take a look at the leadership that President Obama displayed, and draw their own conclusions about what the President\'s legacy says about the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you believe that his evolution on this issue has opened minds and opened hearts to be more embracing of different people?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think leaders in the LGBT community would say that President Obama\'s evolution on gay marriage and President\'s Obama\'s commitment to fighting for greater equality for LGBT Americans has been important to that fight, has been important to that struggle.\xc2\xa0 But again, when it comes to sort of evaluating the full sweep of his legacy, that\'s something that historians will be able to better assess many years from now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Cleveland, we understand that the federal government has offered millions of dollars in prevention and also dealing with if there is a possible -- if there\'s violence there.\xc2\xa0 What is the Obama administration offering, and where are you offering, and will you help in any kind of way as it relates to possible violence in Cleveland for the RNC Convention?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the United States Secret Service has, at least for the last several conventions, played the lead role in ensuring the safety and security of everybody who attends those conventions.\xc2\xa0 And there are significant federal resources that have been expended in that effort.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, federal law enforcement officials, including at the Secret Service, are working closely with state and local law enforcement officials to ensure that security and to ensure that it\'s not just the nominee and the running mate that are protected, but everybody else who is participating in the convention can attend and express his or her political views freely and without being subject to violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that certainly was true what federal officials worked closely with the cities of Charlotte and Tampa in 2012, and it certainly is true both as it relates to the Secret Service\'s role in Philadelphia and Cleveland this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the atmosphere is charging up even more?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\'m thinking back to when this President first ran for the office and people were aghast when they were hearing people were carrying guns to rallies.\xc2\xa0 And now you have a situation where at one point people were thinking about carrying guns to the RNC Convention, and that was kiboshed.\xc2\xa0 And now there\'s a possibility of violence.\xc2\xa0 What is this climate?\xc2\xa0 Where are we right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, the role of the Secret Service is to ensure that those who participate in the conventions can do so safely.\xc2\xa0 But I\'ll leave commentary and the political views of those who choose to attend the RNC to someone else.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President said anything to you?\xc2\xa0 Because he\'s an avid follower of social media.\xc2\xa0 Has he talked about it at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President is certainly aware of the robust political debate that\'s playing out on the campaign trail and likely to be on display at the conventions.\xc2\xa0 But look, ultimately those who attend the Republican Convention should have an opportunity to do so safely.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the last question.\xc2\xa0 Climate change -- did they talk anything about climate change in this hurricane preparedness conversation today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There certainly was a discussion about how some of the very early effects of climate change put some communities across the country at even greater risk from a hurricane.\xc2\xa0 So one example is that there are some communities in South Florida where we have seen sea levels rise and begin to encroach on populated land.\xc2\xa0 That makes a potential impact of storm surge associated with a significant hurricane even more dangerous.\xc2\xa0 And the President is certainly mindful of that risk here at the beginning of hurricane season.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFortunately, he and the country are very well-served by having somebody like Craig Fugate as the head of FEMA.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Fugate is somebody who is a legitimate expert when it comes to helping communities prepare for and respond to a hurricane.\xc2\xa0 And he has restored tremendous competence to that government agency, and the President is certainly proud to have had somebody like Mr. Fugate serving the country in that role while he\'s been President.</p>\n<p>\n\tKaren.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You said earlier that the President would be mindful of the political backdrop of the speech tomorrow in Elkhart.\xc2\xa0 Will he wade into the Democratic race?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I do not anticipate that the President is going to name any candidates tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But I would anticipate that the President will use this opportunity to draw a clear illustration about the choice that the American people will face in November, and that choice is on full display in Elkhart.\xc2\xa0 Elkhart is a community that has benefitted tremendously from many of the decisions that President Obama made early in his presidency to support that community\'s recovery from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President will lay out what\'s at stake if Republicans, at every level, have their way.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen Republicans in Congress fighting tooth and nail to roll back our progress.\xc2\xa0 In fact, they fought the implementation of some of these solutions in the first place.\xc2\xa0 And the question really is a choice between those on the right, who are telling a story of a smaller America that\'s defined and held back by our differences, and the kind of optimistic vision that President Obama has repeatedly laid out about how our country\xe2\x80\x99s diversity makes us stronger and how we can build on the progress that we\'ve made over the last seven years that will ensure everybody has a chance at success.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, who recently has taken to the trail to hock a book, even he has acknowledged that the American people are better off than we were seven years ago.\xc2\xa0 Even he understands that we\'ve made important progress.\xc2\xa0 Apparently he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate the irony of the fact that much of that progress came in spite of his efforts to limit President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s success, limit the country\xe2\x80\x99s success, and to make President Obama a one-term President.\xc2\xa0 That was his stated strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s really the argument that the President will lay out tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And when you consider how Elkhart was affected by the economic downturn, and when you consider that Elkhart was the first community that President Obama visited as President of the United States, it serves as a rather apt illustration of the argument that I think we\'re prepared to have here over the next few months.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a different topic, yesterday there was another lockdown at the White House, an object thrown over the fence.\xc2\xa0 And over the weekend we read about the Secret Service\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for building a higher fence -- 14 feet, double what it currently is, with thicker spikes.\xc2\xa0 Has the President seen the renderings of that potential fence?\xc2\xa0 And if he has, what does he think about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that the President has seen any of the individual renderings that have been made public just in the last few days.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that more than a year ago, after a significant security incident here at the White House, that there was a review that was conducted by the Secret Service where a variety of reforms were developed for enhancing security here at the White House while also protecting the status of the White House as a functioning government building among the more popular tourist destinations in the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the United States Secret Service has a very complex mission here on these 18 acres, and the President has full confidence in the professionalism and the capacity of the United States Secret Service to implement the reforms that our professionals believe are necessary to protect not just the President and the First Family here at the White House, but to protect everybody who works or tours the White House every day.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Republicans on the Hill today are saying that there is no funding crisis for Zika, there never has been, and they are accusing the White House of politicizing a public health emergency.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think by definition, a public health emergency -- at least what our public health professionals tell us -- is something that requires additional funding so that we can protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 So what this administration has done is aggressively advocated for the resources that our public health professionals say that they need to do everything possible to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to protecting pregnant women and their babies, the President believes that we should go to great lengths to do that.\xc2\xa0 If Republicans disagree --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re saying the money is there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If Republicans think that it\'s not that important for us to go to great lengths to protect pregnant women and their babies, then they\xe2\x80\x99re certainly entitled to make that case.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s going to be a tough case for them to make, but they\xe2\x80\x99re certainly entitled to make it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear them make that case exactly, but they seem to suggest that the money is there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, our public health professionals disagree with them.\xc2\xa0 Democratic and Republican governors across the country disagree with them.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama made the case back in February that Congress should act quickly to appropriate the necessary funds.\xc2\xa0 And Republicans now, for more than three months, have dragged their feet and, yes, enhanced the risk facing the American people from the Zika virus because our public health professionals have not gotten the benefit of having had the last three months to prepare for a mosquito population that could be carrying a dangerous virus.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what we\'ve said from the beginning is that this virus is not dangerous to most people, but it does pose a particular danger to pregnant women and their babies.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that we believe is worth protecting.\xc2\xa0 And what our public health professionals say is that we need $1.9 billion in specifically allocated resources to do everything possible to fight that virus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s what we\'ve been seeking for more than three months now to implement.\xc2\xa0 And governors across the country share our concern about this.\xc2\xa0 I know that public health professionals across the country share our concern about this.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress appear to not have gotten the message.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that the Obamas have agreed to rent a home after they leave the White House that is in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C.?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ve obviously read those reports.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not in a position to confirm any details about the housing arrangements that President Obama and his family have made for February of 2017.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say before that he and the First Lady intend to remain in Washington for at least a couple of years at the conclusion of his presidency so as not to disrupt the education of their youngest daughter.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details on where exactly that will be at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In other words, if you did, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s probably true.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the fence situation, which seems to be ongoing, why not just move pedestrian traffic across Pennsylvania Avenue?\xc2\xa0 They still get clear view.\xc2\xa0 It would seem to make things safer.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the Secret Service is considering?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you should check with the Secret Service about this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there are professionals there that are assessing the situation.\xc2\xa0 And what they\'re trying to balance, Kevin, is the pride that I think all citizens take in having the seat of democracy here in Washington, D.C. -- the White House, the home of the President -- also be something that\'s accessible to the public.\xc2\xa0 And there are -- I think it\'s even hundreds of thousands of Americans who visit the White House every year as tourists.\xc2\xa0 There are also hundreds of people who work here in the White House every day as either journalists or employees of the federal government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo our security professionals have a daunting task both to protect a valuable piece of real estate and the occupants of that building, but they also need to ensure that people who are touring the place or people who work here have access to it.\xc2\xa0 And striking that balance is not easy, but it certainly is something that we believe the professionals at the Secret Service have the capacity to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you, on Zika, should we expect another briefing from the public health officials that have been here previously?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If you\'d like one, I\'m sure we could arrange it.\xc2\xa0 But look, what is clear is that this is a serious situation.\xc2\xa0 And our public health professionals are taking it seriously, and they\'re doing as much as they can, with the limited resources that they have right now.\xc2\xa0 But there is more that they believe that they can and should be doing to ensure that the American people are protected, particularly pregnant women and their babies that are most at risk -- that are most threatened by this specific virus.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re not able to do that right now for only one reason, and that\'s because Republicans in Congress have blocked the effort to provide them those necessary resources.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\'m trying to square, though, if there\'s a great risk here -- potential great risk here, does the White House believe that Americans should not go to the Olympics in Brazil?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think our public health professionals have spoken to this, so I\'d defer to the advice of Dr. Frieden and others.\xc2\xa0 I think what they have said, at least in part, is that pregnant women shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go.\xc2\xa0 Pregnant women shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t travel to those areas that are experiencing a widespread outbreak of the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 But for detailed advice, I would encourage people to consult a source that\'s more authoritative on medical issues than the White House Press Secretary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 A quick follow also on the IG situation involving former Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 Was it an oversight that the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t nominate a permanent IG during her time as Secretary of State?\xc2\xa0 And was that a mistake?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that there were a number of people who were considered for that position.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of details about that personnel process.\xc2\xa0 What I do know is that even while an active interim IG was serving at the State Department, there were dozens of reports and other findings that were published, even when there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one inspector general leading the department.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\'s an indication that the individuals in that office took quite seriously the responsibilities that they had to provide oversight and to conduct independent investigations to ensure that the people\'s business was being conducted appropriately at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to that personnel decision, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have much information about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a mistake, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think, to not nominate a permanent IG?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think anybody would be hard-pressed to make the case that somehow the Office of the Inspector General wasn\xe2\x80\x99t functioning effectively -- because I think if you take a look at the dozens of reports that were generated during Secretary Clinton\'s tenure at the State Department, it\'s clear that there was aggressive oversight in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 A couple more.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything the U.S. can do or is doing to prevent China from further militarizing the contested waters in the South China Sea?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, the case that we have made is that the United States does not make any claims to the land features in that region of the world.\xc2\xa0 The United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even back one specific country\'s claim.\xc2\xa0 We simply believe that all the countries that do have competing claims should resolve those disputes through diplomacy, and based on international rules and international law and regular order.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what the United States is seeking to preserve is the ability of every country in the world and of legitimate commercial interests to traverse the South China Sea to ensure that commerce is not disrupted.\xc2\xa0 And certainly China has a significant stake in ensuring that that commerce can continue unimpeded.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly would not want disputes over some of these land features to devolve into a military conflict of one form or another.\xc2\xa0 We believe that those countries with competing claims should pursue, through already-established international procedures, a resolution to those disputes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned something earlier about combat, and I just wanted to kind of drill down on something.\xc2\xa0 And I know I could go to DOD about the specific yes or no, but I\'m just curious about your opinion or about the White House\'s perspective.\xc2\xa0 If a colonel is serving with his company, and he\'s in a very dangerous advise-and-assist environment, combat environment, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t actually out there on patrol, does that person deserve credit for having served in combat, even if they\'re not out there on patrol?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I will say is this:\xc2\xa0 I will defer to my military colleagues at the Department of Defense who obviously have to make decisions about military citations and other recognition that is afforded to our men and women in uniform who serve this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you see what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting at?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s what I -- let me finish my answer, because I think this goes to what you\xe2\x80\x99re getting at.\xc2\xa0 All Americans owe a deep debt of gratitude to our servicemembers who are in that situation because I think what is clear, and certainly what the Commander-in-Chief understands, is that those are individuals who are taking an extraordinary personal risk, that are entering a dangerous situation on the orders of the Commander-in-Chief because it enhances our national security and keeps the rest of us safe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as it relates to the military designations that they\xe2\x80\x99re given, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to the debt of gratitude that all Americans owe those servicemembers, I think you can put the White House down in the column of a group of people who believe that the American people are indebted to those servicemembers for their service to the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last one.\xc2\xa0 CEOs of some of the companies at the center of the recovery in Indiana cite a can-do attitude and a business-friendly environment, including the right to work, that\xe2\x80\x99s allowed Indiana to succeed in spite of, they say, the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies.\xc2\xa0 Do you deny that low interest rates and low gas prices also played a part in the recovery that Indiana has enjoyed since 2009?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has been clear, both from the early days of the recession to now, that it\xe2\x80\x99s the private sector that led our recovery.\xc2\xa0 And it is through the grit and determination of America\xe2\x80\x99s workers and small business owners that we have not just survived but actually thrived in the aftermath of the Great Recession.\xc2\xa0 And there are a number of things that contributed to that success.\xc2\xa0 Many of them are policies that President Obama initiated that were strongly opposed by Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And that is an inconvenient fact for a number of Republicans who are running for Congress and advocating a much different agenda than the one that President Obama has been fighting for, for the last seven years.</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama believes that by focusing on the middle class and trying to grow our economy from the middle out, that is what has laid the foundation for our longer-term economic strength, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the progress that President Obama believes that we should build on moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tCarol.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to quickly clarify on the Eric Holder/Edward Snowden question.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that the President -- setting aside Edward Snowden -- you\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that having a national debate about surveillance is worthwhile, correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s setting aside a lot.\xc2\xa0 But setting aside Edward Snowden, should we have a debate in this country about government transparency and about steps that we can take to protect the American people while also being accountable to the American people?\xc2\xa0 The President does believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s a worthy debate.\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe that we should reveal government secrets that endanger Americans and endanger our national security to have it.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, President Obama initiated many of these reforms and certainly engaged in discussions about some of these reforms before anybody had even heard of Edward Snowden.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to government transparency and protecting the privacy of the American people.\xc2\xa0 But the President does not believe that we need to reveal secrets that endanger our national security in order to have that debate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPam, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Just two quick ones.\xc2\xa0 As far as the Elkhart trip, is it fair to call it a campaign trip, just based on how you described what the President will be talking about?\xc2\xa0 And has he come around to Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s thinking yet, that Hillary Clinton will be the nominee and win the election?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has not reached any conclusions about the conclusion of the Democratic nominating process.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are still votes to be cast in a couple of states and even in the District of Columbia, I believe.\xc2\xa0 So I do not anticipate at this point that he is going to signal a preference or going to indicate the end of a race until it\xe2\x80\x99s ended.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to how you describe the trip -- look, based on some of the questions that the President got at his media availability in Japan, I think there would be some reporters who would describe his Japan trip as a campaign trip.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus when he travels to Elkhart tomorrow will be on our economy, and I think the President would welcome a debate in the context of the campaign but also outside the context of the campaign about what are the economic policies that best serve the country.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that policies that expand economic opportunity for the middle class, policies that are focused on growing our economy from the middle out -- those are the kinds of policies that best serve the American people not just in the short term, but over the long term.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President certainly believes that\xe2\x80\x99s the strategy that was effectively pursued over the seven years of his presidency so far, and he certainly believes that the next President and the next Congress and the next slate of governors and state legislators that are elected across the country in November should look for ways to build on that progress because he believes the country will be best served by doing that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Japan trip, the President made the historic visit to Hiroshima.\xc2\xa0 Some might even call it a magnanimous gesture.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an apology, but it was certainly an acknowledgment of the suffering that occurred there when the bomb was dropped.\xc2\xa0 Did the President feel dissed at all or surprised that Prime Minister Abe, as soon as he arrived in Japan, kind of scolded him publicly over the crime that occurred in Okinawa?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think these are two different issues.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President expressed his profound sorrow on behalf of the American people to the victim of that terrible crime.\xc2\xa0 President Obama reiterated that the United States would, within the confines of the law, coordinate on the investigation and ensure that justice was served in this particular incident.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that in any way overshadowed what I agree was an historic visit to Hiroshima that occurred a couple days later.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is he going to take any steps, as the Prime Minister suggested, to try to control crime that might be associated with the U.S. military there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the Prime Minister was alluding to are steps that could be taken by U.S. personnel in Okinawa that could have an impact on the way that U.S. military facilities there are run -- the way that people have access to the facilities and the way that personnel spend time off the base.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to local military officials in Okinawa for details about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:48 P.M.
