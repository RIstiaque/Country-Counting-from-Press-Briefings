Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>See below for a follow up to a question (marked with an asterisk) posed in the briefing.</p>\n<p>*On Tuesday afternoon, the President spoke with President Castro via telephone.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>2:08 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure to be standing before you on what is a genuinely historic day here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re starting a little late in order to give Mr. Gross an opportunity to make his appearance and complete his remarks.\xc2\xa0 And I had the opportunity to see those remarks, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that on behalf of everybody here at the White House, we certainly are pleased that he is home here today.</p>\n<p>So with that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wow.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Dramatic entrance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That was quite an entrance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have a problem with it?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 Jim, would you like to go ahead and get us started?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of Cuba and opening Cuban relations, Senator Rubio and others are already saying that Congress will not appropriate money to set up an embassy in Havana and that the Senate will not confirm a U.S. ambassador to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Is the President confident he can overcome these kinds of obstacles to achieve this kind of historic shift?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess my first reaction is that as a point of fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear to me that additional appropriations will be necessary to establish an embassy in Cuba, principally because there is already a significant diplomatic presence in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 There is an Interests Section there that represents the interests of the United States.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any specific appropriations request that has been made; there may be one in the future, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>As it relates to support in Congress, I have seen the comments of some who have been critical of this decision.\xc2\xa0 I think the President acknowledged there would be some who do not agree with his decision.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, there are many in Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, who are strongly supportive of this decision.\xc2\xa0 Let me just read you the comments of Senator Flake.\xc2\xa0 I single him out because he is among the Republicans in the United States Senate who happens to support the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy.\xc2\xa0 Senator Flake said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been in Congress in the House and Senate for 14 years now.\xc2\xa0 All 14 of those years, I pushed to lift the travel ban and to normalize relations.\xc2\xa0 I think our policy has done more to keep the Castros in power than anything, so it\xe2\x80\x99s high time for a change -- 50 years is long enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That certainly is consistent with the sentiment that the President expressed today.\xc2\xa0 I think it is a common-sense position that I think is also strongly supported by the vast majority of the American public.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Senator Flake illustrate the issue?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been trying to do this for quite some time and has not been able to.\xc2\xa0 So can the President count on actual change in attitudes in Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess based on the math here revealed by Senator Flake, it sounds like he entered the United States Congress at the beginning of the Bush administration.\xc2\xa0 President Bush obviously did not support making this policy change, and President Obama ran for office in 2008 vowing to address Cuba policy that, for more than five decades, has failed to bring about the kind of results that are in the best interest of American national security.</p>\n<p>So the President has long sought to make this change, and the chief impediment to his ability to make that change was the unjust detention of Mr. Gross.\xc2\xa0 And because he was released today on humanitarian grounds, because through the work of this administration we were able to secure that release on humanitarian grounds, we removed the impediment to being able to implement some of these policy changes that the President clearly believes are in the best interest of this country, they\xe2\x80\x99re in the best interest of our economy, and they\xe2\x80\x99re in the best interest of our national security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you clarify a little bit about how this intelligence asset, this gentleman who has been in prison for 20 years, how he helped in the prosecution and investigations of Ana Montes and the Myers, Kendall Myers and Gwendolyn Myers?\xc2\xa0 Given that their arrest didn\xe2\x80\x99t occur until 2001 and 2009, respectively, how was he able to do this -- from prison?\xc2\xa0 Or was this information he had supplied before?\xc2\xa0 Can you shed some light on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can tell -- Jim, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a whole lot that I can share about this high-priority intelligence asset that has been in Cuban custody for nearly 20 years now and is back -- or is now on American soil.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I can tell you that he provided valuable intelligence and valuable counter-intelligence, that he did provide information about Americans who were sharing information with the Cuban regime.\xc2\xa0 And because of his efforts and because of information that he shared, it led to the discovery and conviction of a couple of these Americans who were spying for the Cubans.</p>\n<p>We also know that he provided valuable intelligence to help us uncover the Wasp Network that was essentially a Cuban-run intelligence network in south Florida.\xc2\xa0 And the kind of spy swap that was executed today, essentially trading some members of that Wasp Network in exchange for this highly valued intelligence asset in Cuba is consistent with the kinds of spy swaps that have been executed by many Presidents, not just over decades but over centuries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we certainly are pleased that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to bring that highly valued intelligence asset, an individual who is a legitimate hero, to American soil.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t know when it was that he provided this information that led to those particular cases?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m obviously not in a position to provide a lot of clarity about the clandestine efforts of this intelligence asset.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, can you talk about the relationship between Rajiv Shah\xe2\x80\x99s departure from USAID and this decision to open up relations with Cuba?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is no relationship at all.\xc2\xa0 I know that Administrator Shah is someone who has served this administration for nearly five years now in the role as the administrator of USAID.\xc2\xa0 He is a very talented young man who has had an opportunity to use his expertise, both in medicine but also his background in development, to run that agency and to take on some very significant responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 And whether it was the success that we had in terms of making a contribution to the efforts to rebuild after the Haiti earthquake, to even putting personnel on the ground to try and stop this Ebola outbreak in its tracks in West Africa, that he has presided over a tenure at USAID that has been remarkably challenging, but he has been remarkably effective.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are incredibly grateful for his service.</p>\n<p>I understand that the transition that was announced today is one that had been in the works for quite some time now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as you know, the Cuban government has not been happy with USAID programs in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 The juxtaposition of the two does raise questions.\xc2\xa0 If he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want those questions raised, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t one have been delayed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to answer the questions, is to make clear exactly what is happening.\xc2\xa0 I guess the other data point that I can provide to you is that the USAID programs that have been in place and that have drawn the criticism of the Cuban regime will continue even after Dr. Shah transitions out of his current job.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, does the President envision a visit to Havana?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is nothing on the schedule right now.\xc2\xa0 The President did hint that there will be senior government officials who will carry out the kind of work that\xe2\x80\x99s indicative of two nations that are seeking to normalize their relations, so I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out a presidential visit, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to announce at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 He would like to go, though?\xc2\xa0 He would like to go?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I assume, like many Americans, he has seen that Cuba is a place where they have a beautiful climate and a lot of fun things to do.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So if there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for the President to visit, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t turn it down.\xc2\xa0 How about that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the points that Senator Rubio made is that the White House has conceded everything but gained little.\xc2\xa0 What has the White House gained?\xc2\xa0 What has the United States gained from this deal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are many things, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go through them.\xc2\xa0 The first is, we secured the humanitarian release of Mr. Gross.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that we have long sought.\xc2\xa0 He was held unjustifiably by the Cubans for more than five years.\xc2\xa0 His release is long overdue.\xc2\xa0 And we are pleased to see that the Cubans have granted him his humanitarian release.</p>\n<p>The second thing is we have secured an agreement to essentially swap spies, and we recovered a highly valued intelligence asset, probably the most highly valued intelligence asset on Cuban soil in American history.\xc2\xa0 And that individual is now on American soil.</p>\n<p>What we have also done is we have removed what had previously been the chief impediment to our ability to implement the kind of changes and reforms in our policy that the President believes is clearly in the best interest of the country.\xc2\xa0 And now that Mr. Gross has been returned, we can now better orient our foreign policy and our policy toward Cuba in a way that better reflects our values, that empowers the Cuban people, that will expand economic opportunity for American businesses and American farmers in particular here in the United States.</p>\n<p>So we certainly are pleased with the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made here.\xc2\xa0 The President has been clear that he does not anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the kinds of changes that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see overnight.\xc2\xa0 But after more than five decades of a policy in place that didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to lead to any changes at all that were in our favor, we certainly are optimistic -- very optimistic -- about the new strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99re putting in place that will better serve American interests, that will better empower the Cuban people, that will seek to engage Cuba in a way that will no longer allow our failed policy against Cuba to be such a distraction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Some of you have traveled with the President to previous Summit of the Americas conferences, for one example.\xc2\xa0 This is often a contentious debate that\xe2\x80\x99s held in the context of these summits about whether or not the United States has the right policy on Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Now that that policy has been changed, we hope that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to foster a greater debate about whether or not the Cuban government has the right policy when it comes to their own people, and whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to get away with trampling the basic human and political rights that the United States has long championed.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to that opportunity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantees that this deal will result in Cuba making the economic and political reforms?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have seen Cuba start to make some preliminary steps towards economic reforms.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen statements today from the American Farm Bureau, from the Chamber of Commerce, indicating that they are optimistic that the changes that the President announced today will lead to substantial economic reforms.\xc2\xa0 That will not just be good for the United States, that will also be good for the people of Cuba and will better empower the people of Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what you call a win-win.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, but this is all temporary, right?\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of the embargo, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of the travel ban while President Obama is in office, a future Republican President, or potentially Democratic President, could come in, close the embassy and put these travel restrictions back in place.\xc2\xa0 Fair enough?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess as a legal matter that is true.\xc2\xa0 I suspect, however, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that anyone is going to campaign for this office by saying, you know that policy that we had in place for more than five decades and didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything -- we should go back to doing that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeb Bush is saying he\xe2\x80\x99s against this policy shift that the President announced today.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I recognize that that may be popular with some very committed individuals that do have principled views on this.\xc2\xa0 I certainly respect their views.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that any cold-eyed assessment of the success of the policy that has been in place for more than five decades to isolate Cuba would acknowledge that that policy didn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed.\xc2\xa0 Since that policy has been in place, the Castro regime has remained in place.\xc2\xa0 Since that policy has been in place, the Castro regime has continued to trample the basic human rights of the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\'s time for a change.\xc2\xa0 And there is plenty of reason to believe that the kinds of changes that the President announced today will lead to the kinds of economic and social reforms that will be good for the people of Cuba and will be good for the United States of America.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think he can get the embargo lifted by the time he leaves office?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We certainly would like to see that.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan support for it.\xc2\xa0 But that will require some work.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about the outgoing Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman, Bob Menendez.\xc2\xa0 He had been a fierce opponent -- Cuban American -- fierce opponent of these kinds of changes, a big supporter of the embargo.\xc2\xa0 Did his departure, or his soon-to-be departure from that position as chair of that committee have anything to do with the timing of this announcement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The only impact on timing here was the humanitarian release of Mr. Gross.\xc2\xa0 This is a policy change that this administration had long sought.\xc2\xa0 And after securing the humanitarian release of Mr. Gross, we\xe2\x80\x99re able to remove the impediment to the implementation of these policy changes that the President believes is more consistent with our broader national security priorities and more consistent with a policy that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on expanding economic opportunity in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you talk at all about the conversation the President had with Alan Gross?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I do know that the President earlier today, while Mr. Gross was on the airplane, had the opportunity to take a phone call from the President.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the details on that phone conversation, but I know that the President was very pleased with having the opportunity to speak briefly with Mr. Gross.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned at the top of this briefing, the President, like everybody else here at the White House today, is very pleased to welcome Mr. Gross home.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you worried about the -- my last thing on this.\xc2\xa0 Are you worried that Americans may get the wrong idea about what you\xe2\x80\x99ve announced today?\xc2\xa0 Because with the embargo in place, Americans cannot go on Orbitz and book a flight to Havana.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be able to go to the cigar shop down the street and buy Cuban cigars.\xc2\xa0 There is still all of these cumbersome restrictions in place.\xc2\xa0 So by and large, how much has changed really that Americans can see and touch and feel besides the opening of an embassy in a building that is really already there in Havana?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What this will do, Jim, is this will -- this represents a fundamental shift in American foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 One from isolation that for more than five decades has failed to yield any sort of tangible result that benefits the American people, that benefits the Cuban people, or that benefits the American national security interests.</p>\n<p>But because the policy that the President has now announced, we will see greater economic engagement between the United States and Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And again, this seems like as good of a time as any to read from part of the statement that was issued by the United States Chamber of Commerce today.\xc2\xa0 They certainly believe that it will have a tangible impact on the U.S. economy in a way that the American people will feel.\xc2\xa0 They said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe U.S. business community welcomes today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement and has long supported many of the economic provisions the President touched on in his remarks.\xc2\xa0 We deeply believe that an open dialogue and commercial exchange between the United States and Cuban private sectors will bring shared benefits.\xc2\xa0 And the steps announced today by the President will go a long way in allowing opportunities for free enterprise to flourish.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That is an indication that there is a clear economic benefit associated with the policy decision that the President announced today.</p>\n<p>The other strategic objective that has been accomplished here is no longer will the U.S. policy toward Cuba serve as such a distraction in our relations with communities -- with countries throughout the Western hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 So often when we go to these other events or have engaged in dialogue with other countries in the Western hemisphere, they say, well, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about your policy towards Cuba.\xc2\xa0 No longer will they have to raise that objection.\xc2\xa0 Now we can go to them and say, let\xe2\x80\x99s go talk about your policy toward Cuba and the policy of the Cuban government toward their own people.\xc2\xa0 And that, ultimately, better serves our objective.\xc2\xa0 That it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be about isolation, it should be about engagement and openness.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s more likely to lead to the kind of strategic accomplishments that the President believes serves our national interest.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the Castro government starts rounding up political prisoners again, do you have to re-examine what --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing that for more than 50 years.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to use this openness and this engagement to focus pressure on the Castro regime, to live up -- or at least to respect if not protect the basic fundamental human and political rights that this country has long championed.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, two questions.\xc2\xa0 One is, can you elaborate on the telecommunications and Internet changes and progress that the United States believes it has worked out with the Castro government?\xc2\xa0 And I ask that in particular because we know that in China, for instance, there have been efforts to block that for the people in China.\xc2\xa0 And I just wondered, what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s understanding about what the Cuban people will have access to?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I may have to take some of the more technical aspects of your question, but I think as a general matter, this is consistent with the kind of strategy that the President is pursuing here; that we want to facilitate more openness in our relationship between the United States and Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And by facilitating that openness, we do principally one thing, which is empower the Cuban people.</p>\n<p>For so long, this policy of isolation that has been in place for more than five decades has only added to the burden that the Cuban people have had to bear.\xc2\xa0 But by making these kinds of changes and allowing for more U.S. telecommunications equipment to be sold and put into use in Cuba, we can give the Cuban people more access to information in a way that will empower them to have potentially more say on the economy and on their government.\xc2\xa0 And that is certainly consistent with this philosophy that our policy of isolation has failed.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to pursue a policy of openness and engagement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second question I had was about Americans who may be imprisoned around the world.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a status report on how many Americans of whatever disposition or work are imprisoned currently around the world, and whether the President is doing everything -- is in his gain to try to release as many of them as possible in the next two years?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department for any sort of list.\xc2\xa0 If anybody has a list like that, it would be them.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they do, but you can certainly check with them.</p>\n<p>But the President I think on a number of occasions, and this is just the latest one, has demonstrated his commitment and demonstrated a tenacity to securing the release of Americans who are unjustifiably detained overseas.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President today was talking about easing exports, but how much authority does the administration have to ease both import and export bans?\xc2\xa0 Or do you need legislation for that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President did take steps today to ease restrictions on exports.\xc2\xa0 And there are substantial steps that the President can take using his executive authority to relax some of the restrictions that were in place in a way that would facilitate greater trade and greater economic activity between the United States and Cuba.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But for details about the questions that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking, I think I would actually refer you to the Treasury Department that\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for administering those restrictions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s going to also pursue legislation --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the President does believe that these -- what the President has done is he has used all of the executive authority that he has to try to take away some of these restrictions.\xc2\xa0 Some of these restrictions remain in place; Mr. Acosta alluded to a couple of them related to travel.\xc2\xa0 And we do believe that Congress should take the necessary action to remove those restrictions as well, again, to facilitate the kind of openness and engagement that we believe will lead to greater progress in terms of advancing American national security priorities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why -- any timelines?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how soon can we start to see some of these export restrictions lifted?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is certainly eager to see these changes be put into place.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to both Treasury and Commerce who can walk you through the details.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Bob Corker will be the new Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee when the new Congress convenes.\xc2\xa0 He said just a few moments ago, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no real understanding as to what changes the Cuban government is prepared to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What is this administration\xe2\x80\x99s understandings of the commitments the Cuban government is prepared to make in reaction to many things it has long sought from this administration, which it has now received?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, they\xe2\x80\x99ve already made commitments to do three things that, again, over the course of more than five decades, it had been reluctant to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The first is, the Cuban government, based on their own assessment and at the urging of the United States, did release more than 50 political prisoners.\xc2\xa0 Some of them have already been released, some of them will be released in coming days.\xc2\xa0 And that is certainly a welcome development.\xc2\xa0 These are names that were provided by the U.S. government to the Cubans, and we urged them to be released.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what they did.</p>\n<p>The second thing is -- and this is what Alexis referred to -- is they agreed to allow the import and installation and use of American telecommunications equipment that would give the Cuban people access to more information.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And third, we saw the Cuban government commit to greater engagement with the United Nations and with the International Committee of the Red Cross.\xc2\xa0 These are two international, multilateral organizations that champion the kinds of values that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been urging the Castro regime to respect for some time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So again, when we\xe2\x80\x99re sort of evaluating the success of these efforts, these are three specific things that the Castro regime has committed to that, after 50 years, or more than 50 years of refusing to do so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to those who would say there\xe2\x80\x99s no commitment to free elections, there\xe2\x80\x99s no commitment to a free press, and there is no promise to end systematic political repression in the country, you would say what?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would say that there was no evidence that they were more likely to do those things after the 53 or so years that this embargo has been in place.\xc2\xa0 We do think that by putting in place a policy that allows for more openness and engagement, a policy that will empower the Cuban people, that there will be more pressure on the Cuban regime brought to bear to force them to better respect the basic political and human rights of their people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you alluded to the possibility, somewhat humorously, of the President going to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 But just to bear down on it a little bit, he would not go there now with the political repression that exists in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 He would not want to go there under these current circumstances, would he?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Keep in mind, Major, a month ago we were both in Beijing.\xc2\xa0 Right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he would.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, all I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that it is not unprecedented for us to go places and interact with countries with whom we have a very fundamental difference of opinion about that country\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of their citizens.</p>\n<p>A day after we were in Beijing, we traveled to Burma -- again, a country that does not have a stellar record when it comes to respecting basic human and political rights.\xc2\xa0 But we engage those countries and we engage the leadership of those countries, and we do so for a variety of reasons.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes, and often, it serves our national security interests to do so, but also because it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that by engaging with the leaders of these countries and by engaging with the people of these countries, we can facilitate more respect for basic human rights.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The most recent congressional action dealing with Cuba is the Helms-Burton Act in 1996.\xc2\xa0 It dramatically intensified the trade embargo and also placed limitations on foreign countries interacting with Cuba.\xc2\xa0 President Clinton signed that into law.\xc2\xa0 Was there any interaction between the President or anyone senior in this administration with those Clinton administration officials or President Clinton himself about this very historic change in policy?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding about the Helms-Burton Act that what it actually did was it took some of the executive actions that had been taken toward putting restrictions on trade and travel in place, and actually codifying them statutorily.\xc2\xa0 So that is part of what leads us to the need for Congress to take action to repeal some of those restrictions.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly call on them to do so.</p>\n<p>As it relates to your specific question on President Clinton, I know that there have been some consultations with former President Clinton, but I haven\'t seen a statement that he has put out on this yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President and -- the two Presidents?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I often am reluctant to talk about specific conversations that take place between the President and former President Clinton.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to confirm those kinds of conversations.\xc2\xa0 But I know that there have been conversations between the White House and President Clinton on this specific issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you seek to enlist President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s support in this policy and reversing some of the things that he himself signed into law?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We certainly would welcome the support of President Clinton and anybody else that wants to be supportive of changing a policy that for more than 50 years did not yield results that are beneficial to our national security, and putting in place a different strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on engagement and openness that we believe will empower the Cuban people, expand economic opportunity for American businesses and farmers, and better serve the national security interests of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at the underlying principle here.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said that the policy of putting economic pressure on Cuba, isolating Cuba, failed to change Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s bad behavior, and a policy of economic engagement and openness will have the better prospect of changing Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s bad behavior, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly seems unlikely that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be worse than a policy that was in place for more than five decades and didn\xe2\x80\x99t yield any tangible change.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So explain to me why you think a policy of economic pressure and isolation towards Russia would change Russia\xe2\x80\x99s bad behavior when you say that that very approach to Cuba has utterly failed for more than 50 years?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is a timely discussion, so I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a chance to talk about it.\xc2\xa0 We have spent some time talking about this today.\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s what I think is the principal difference.\xc2\xa0 And again, for two days in a row I\xe2\x80\x99m going to violate what is often a core principle about comparing our policies as it relates to very different countries in very different situations.\xc2\xa0 But I do think this serves as a useful illustration.</p>\n<p>In talking about the sanctions regime that we put in place, both against Russia and Iran, we have said the success of that sanctions regime is dependent on our ability to work with our partners and allies around the globe to implement the regime in a coordinated fashion to maximize the pressure on those countries.\xc2\xa0 And what we saw was we saw that the pressure that was placed on the Iranian economy did yield political pressure that has changed the perspective of the Iranian regime at least as it relates to their willingness to have a discussion with the international community about their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>When it comes to Russia, again, we acted in coordinated fashion with countries, principally in Western Europe, to apply pressure to Russia and their economy.\xc2\xa0 It has had the effect of weakening the Russian economy, but has not yet yielded the kinds of changes in the decision-making by the Russian President that we would like to see.\xc2\xa0 I think it warrants mentioning that those sanctions -- that sanctions regime that we put place in a coordinated fashion with our allies has been in place for less than a year, certainly a lot less than 53 or 54 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to get at the principle here.\xc2\xa0 Does economic pressure work to change bad behavior of a regime or not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the principle, Jon.\xc2\xa0 The sanctions regime that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in place against Cuba is unilateral.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re the only country in the world that has this kinds of sanctions regime.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it imposes an economic price on Cuba.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it has hurt Cuba.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But not nearly in the same kind of way that we would see if the United States were working effectively with our partners and allies to put in place this kind of sanctions regime.\xc2\xa0 The key to our success in Iran and Russia -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying for the first time today; this is the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been making for some time now -- that the success of the sanctions regime has been predicated on our ability to work in coordinated fashion with the rest of the international community to maximize the impact of that sanctions regime.\xc2\xa0 And as it relates to Cuba, the effect is actually the opposite.\xc2\xa0 The rest of the world is actually on the other side of this issue.\xc2\xa0 They criticize our sanctions regime policy against Cuba, and it actually interferes with our ability to bring to bear pressure from the rest of the international community on the Castro regime to better respect human rights in Cuba.</p>\n<p>So there is a very stark difference in the way that these policies were implemented.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe that a strategy -- a fundamental strategy change was necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I get you to respond to what Bob Menendez, obviously the top Democrat -- actually, current chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said about this action?\xc2\xa0 He said that this action vindicates the \xe2\x80\x9cbrutal behavior of the Cuban government\xe2\x80\xa6Trading Mr. Gross for three convicted criminals sets an extremely dangerous precedent and invites dictatorial rogue regimes to use Americans serving overseas as bargaining chips.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And he says that this will put thousands of Americans serving overseas increased danger for that very reason.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to Senator Menendez?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, here at the White House we obviously have tremendous respect for Senator Menendez.\xc2\xa0 He is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and we have worked with him to implement the sanctions regime on Russia that has been useful in advancing our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve done the same thing with Iran.\xc2\xa0 So we have succeeded in working with Senator Menendez, Chairman Menendez on a range of issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But in this situation, we fundamentally disagree.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no soft-pedaling that.\xc2\xa0 The fact -- and there\xe2\x80\x99s one factual disagreement that should be pointed out here:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Gross was released on humanitarian grounds.\xc2\xa0 For years, the Cuban regime has suggested that Mr. Gross could be released in exchange for the release of Cuban prisoners, and that is a proposal that was summarily rejected by this administration.\xc2\xa0 If we were open to that, that is an agreement that we would have agreed to years ago.</p>\n<p>So the fact of the matter is, Mr. Gross was released on humanitarian grounds at the request of this administration, and the spy swap that was executed between the United States and Cuba did secure the release of this intelligence asset that is now on American soil.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you are not going to stand there and say that Alan Gross\xe2\x80\x99s release had nothing to do with the release at the same time of the three convicted Cuban spies.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you is that Alan Gross\xe2\x80\x99s release on humanitarian grounds is something that this administration insisted upon.\xc2\xa0 And once that agreement was reached, it opened the door for additional negotiations and additional agreements to be reached.\xc2\xa0 So by removing the impediment of Mr. Gross\xe2\x80\x99s unjust detention, we could engage in a conversation with the Cubans about the spy swap.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what happened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a coincidence that they were both released at the same time?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- Jon, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a coincidence.\xc2\xa0 What exactly happened --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s all part of the same deal, how can you say that the -- I mean, Alan Gross is released, three spies are released.\xc2\xa0 I understand you also have a Cuban who was working with U.S. intelligence who was released at the same time as part of the same package, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t say that the Alan Gross release is unrelated to the release of these three convicted spies.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I can and I just did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is very simple, Jon.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is very simple.\xc2\xa0 The agreement on a spy swap would not have been reached and was not reached without the standalone agreement to release Mr. Gross on humanitarian grounds.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It happens at the same time, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this all today?\xc2\xa0 Am I missing something?\xc2\xa0 Were the --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, but as I think -- as you know, these conversations between the United States and Cuba were underway for more than a year between senior officials here in this administration and senior Cuban officials.\xc2\xa0 And all along, the fundamental impediment to our ability to implement the kinds of changes that we would like to see has been the unjust detention of Mr. Gross.\xc2\xa0 And once the Cubans agreed to release him on humanitarian grounds, then we could have a conversation about some of the other agreements that were reached, and the other agreement that was reached was this specific spy swap between the three Cubans that were held in Florida and the highly valued intelligence asset that has been held in Cuba for almost 20 years but is now on American soil.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Just one quick one on a different subject, the Sony hacking.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. government have a reason to believe that, in fact, North Korea was responsible for the hacking?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I am not in a position to ascribe any responsibility to the apparent hacking of the email system at Sony.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If it were the -- if we do have evidence that it was North Korea, would there be repercussions?\xc2\xa0 Would the United States seek repercussions for that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate at this point.\xc2\xa0 This is something that is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and so for questions on their investigation I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you considering normalizing relations with North Korea under the same theory that if you open it up that you\xe2\x80\x99ll put more pressure on them and maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll change their behavior?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On Jon\xe2\x80\x99s questioning about the timing of all of this, will you at least acknowledge that Alan Gross\xe2\x80\x99s release was coordinated?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President of the United States had a phone call yesterday with the Cuban dictator.\xc2\xa0 Did they discuss this maybe in separate sentences, but they discussed all of this in one deal, right?*</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, they discussed a wide range of things.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t provide a detailed readout of their conversation, but they spent a lot of time talking about policies in the Western hemisphere, and you can be assured that the President did talk about how important it was for somebody -- for an American citizen who was being held unjustifiably by the Cuban regime, that it was important for that individual to be released on humanitarian grounds, and he was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Jon\xe2\x80\x99s other question about what kinds of precedent this sets -- what Marco Rubio and others are charging at least is that this puts a price on American hostages, and that it gives rogue regimes the idea that they can get concessions out of the President of the United States if they take someone hostage.\xc2\xa0 Why should they think differently?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because there was no concession.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Gross was released on humanitarian grounds.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we insisted upon and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Cuban regime followed through on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, except when we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about ISIS and the awful tragic beheadings, you\xe2\x80\x99ve repeatedly said the American government won\xe2\x80\x99t pay ransom because that just encourages people to take more Americans.\xc2\xa0 But I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make this separation, but as part of the same deal, the U.S. made concessions and released three Cubans.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed with Jon, that\xe2\x80\x99s just not the case.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, Mr. Gross was released on humanitarian grounds at the insistence of this administration.\xc2\xa0 And certainly if there are -- I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us talk about this in other contexts; when there are Americans who are unjustifiably held overseas, we call for their immediate release as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 For months -- months ago, I should say, you had promised that there was a review going on of the separate prisoner swap, Taliban swap, over Bowe Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked you about it before and you said, well, the Pentagon is looking at it.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s just been a swap here with spies.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for a public accounting of Bowe Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 When will that investigation be released?\xc2\xa0 When will you be able to show us?\xc2\xa0 Because there were charges that you broke the law because you did not fully inform Congress.\xc2\xa0 So when will there be --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not part of the review, Ed, because that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case.\xc2\xa0 I recognize that that was the charge from some who disagreed with this decision.\xc2\xa0 The President believed that there was a basic fundamental value at stake here, which is that the Commander-in-Chief was not going to be in a position where we didn\xe2\x80\x99t work to secure the release of one of our men and women in uniform to bring them home; that we were not going to leave that man behind.</p>\n<p>And the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay was certified by the Secretary of Defense consistent with the law.\xc2\xa0 I recognize there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference of opinion about that, but that is what it is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re going to release the review with the documents that show why the Secretary of Defense made that decision?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, the review is related to the circumstances related to the disappearance of Sergeant Bergdahl in the first place.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update in terms of the status of that report, but we believe that that agreement was one that was entirely consistent with a fundamental American value, which is that we leave no man behind.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you all have made -- highlighted, I should say, the pivotal role that the Pope played in the Vatican, played in securing the release of Alan Gross.\xc2\xa0 Did President Obama speak with the Pope prior to today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he did have an opportunity to speak to the Pope.\xc2\xa0 You know a couple of things, though, that the President did receive a personal letter from the Pope, and high-level administration officials convened at least one discussion with their Cuban counterparts in the Vatican, in a meeting that was hosted by members of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s team.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the Pope himself was personally involved in those conversations, but the Vatican was the host of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 We certainly welcomed their participation in these conversations, and the degree to which the Pope and his team facilitated this reconciliation is one that we appreciate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the Vatican given a heads up prior to today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement in some way, shape or form?\xc2\xa0 Did top officials here reach out to their counterparts there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations with the Pope to read out, but yes, that there were senior members of the Catholic church that were aware of what was on going here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And when President Obama spoke with President Castro yesterday, first of all, can you tell us what time that conversation happened?\xc2\xa0 Was it during the day, was it during the evening?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe it was during the day, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific timeframe.\xc2\xa0 We can look into that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did President Castro give President Obama any specific assurances that he would take steps toward democratic reform like freedom of the press, improving that?\xc2\xa0 Any other steps or specific guarantees that he gave President Obama?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, he did announce a few things -- or he did inform the President of a few things.\xc2\xa0 He did inform the President that he intended -- his government intended to release more than 50 political prisoners that we\xe2\x80\x99re being held in Cuban prisons.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in addition to what\xe2\x80\x99s been announced, of what\xe2\x80\x99s been announced today, did he more broadly say, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\'m going to continue to take steps to democratize Cuba\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well again, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to talk to him if he wants to read out his aspect of the conversation.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that there were three specific commitments that he made.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s more that they want to share, they can do so.\xc2\xa0 You can be sure that the President continued to impress upon President Castro that it continued to be an American priority and the priority of the Western hemisphere that his government do more to protect and advance the basic fundamental human rights of the Cuban people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama trust President Castro?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kristen, this is not a matter of trust, this is a matter of putting in place a policy that the President believes is in the best interest of our economy, is in the best interest of our national security, and will actually succeed in empowering the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 That is the goal of this policy and is a policy that we\xe2\x80\x99re eager to put in place.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with our national security priorities, and frankly, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hinge upon the trustworthiness of the Cuban leader.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess the other way to say that is, does President Obama have confidence that there will be continued reform within Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And if so, why?\xc2\xa0 What gives him that sense confidence?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we have confidence in is that the policy that we have announced today will do more to pressure the Castro regime to actually respect and protect, and even advance the basic kind of human rights that for more than five decades under the old policy, that they\xe2\x80\x99ve repeatedly ignored.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t see human rights advanced, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t see the regime taking steps toward that end, what recourse does the President have?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d start by saying we already have seen the Cuban regime take more steps in the last day than they have in the last 50 years under the old policy in terms of expanding access to information for the Cuban people, in terms of coordinating with international organizations like the United Nations and the Red Cross, and in terms of releasing political prisoners.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any recourse if it ends there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we have is we have a policy in place that will continue to empower the Cuban people, and will remove the distraction of the failed U.S. policy and actually focus international attention on the policy of the Cuban government as it relates to their own people.</p>\n<p>Nadia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you Josh.\xc2\xa0 On a different topic, the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s (inaudible) today removed Hamas from the terrorist list.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 And do you think that will advance the peace process?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Nadia, we did note today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling by the General Court of the European Union on the challenge by the terrorist organization Hamas to its EU sanctions listing.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re studying the court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion carefully.\xc2\xa0 According to the statement by the EU, the decision was based on procedural grounds.\xc2\xa0 And we understand that the EU sanctions against Hamas remain in effect, pending the EU\xe2\x80\x99s decision on whether to appeal.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you -- so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to review the EU decision, but what is clear is that the EU sanctions will remain in place.</p>\n<p>I can confirm for you that the United States position on Hamas has not changed.\xc2\xa0 Hamas is an organization that\xe2\x80\x99s been designated as a foreign terrorist organization, precisely because Hamas continues to engage in terrorist activity and has demonstrated its intent during this summer\xe2\x80\x99s conflict with Israel.\xc2\xa0 It fired thousands of rockets into Israeli civilian areas and attempted to infiltrate Israel through tunnels that extended into Israel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the United States will continue to work closely with the EU on a range of Hamas-related issues.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that the EU should maintain its terrorism sanctions on Hamas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the EU decision was legal more than political.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. decision to designate Hamas as a terrorist organization based on the legal issue as well, or just political?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the EU decision is one that was based on procedural grounds, and so we\xe2\x80\x99ll allow that procedure to run its course.\xc2\xa0 I understand that while that procedure is in place, the sanctions against Hamas will remain in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The decision that\xe2\x80\x99s been made by the United States to designate Hamas as a terrorist organization is based entirely on Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s terror activities; that we saw them use missiles to target innocent Israeli citizens.\xc2\xa0 We saw them use tunnels to carry out attacks against Israeli civilians.\xc2\xa0 These are the hallmarks of an organization that\xe2\x80\x99s committed to terrorism, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been designated as such by the U.S. government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any evidence there\xe2\x80\x99s been international engagement in any kind of terrorism act outside Israel or the Palestinian territories?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, sort of for the full rundown on Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s rap sheet, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the United States Treasury that would make designations about Hamas as a terrorist organization. \xc2\xa0The State Department may have some information on this as well.\xc2\xa0 But certainly the acts of terror that Hamas has committed in Israel certainly justifies their labeling as a terrorist organization.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a related subject, the Palestinian Authority is presenting a draft resolution at the Security Council today, calling for the end of Israeli occupation and the establishment of a Palestinian state by 2016.\xc2\xa0 Are you going to veto that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have not yet seen the details of the resolution that they say that they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to table at the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to reserve any comment on that for now.</p>\n<p>I will tell you that it continues to be the policy of the United States that the preferred path to Palestinian statehood and a resolution of this conflict is for the two parties -- the Israelis and the Palestinians -- to reach an agreement on the final status issues by negotiating directly.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work to advance the interest we all share in bringing about a lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</p>\n<p>The United States takes this position because it is clearly in the interest of both the Israeli people and the Palestinian people for this situation to be resolved peacefully and through direct negotiations between the two parties.</p>\n<p>Tamara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was at the White House for a meeting.\xc2\xa0 Was this related?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President did have the opportunity to visit with the Archbishop, and they talked about a range of issues.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a detailed readout of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 But to sort of paraphrase Major\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion from earlier in this briefing, if you wanted to infer that this might have been among the things that they talked about because it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that both the President and the Catholic Church have strong feelings about, then I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wave you off that notion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And an update on the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any update at all on the search for a new director or any changes that are being made?\xc2\xa0 The report was due earlier this week.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that the Department of Homeland Security will have more information on this today, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them.</p>\n<p>Connie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Follow on Cuba.\xc2\xa0 A few months ago, I spoke to Jos\xc3\xa9 Caba\xc3\xb1as, the Chief of the Cuban Interests Section, and he outlined how this would be resolved.\xc2\xa0 And he stressed -- he said, don\xe2\x80\x99t use the words \xe2\x80\x9cspy swap\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cprisoner swap;\xe2\x80\x9d make sure you call it \xe2\x80\x9chumanitarian grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Who initiated these -- the Cuban side or the American side?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s separate out two things.\xc2\xa0 The last part there about the spy swap -- Mr. Gross was released on humanitarian grounds.\xc2\xa0 He was not exchanged for the release of any other prisoners or release of any spies.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Gross is not a spy, so it would not be possible for him to be part of a spy swap.\xc2\xa0 He was released on humanitarian grounds.</p>\n<p>There was a separate agreement that was reached to exchange three Cuban prisoners, spies who were being held on American soil, for a U.S. intelligence asset that had been held by the Castro regime for nearly 20 years now.\xc2\xa0 That individual is now on American soil.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As it relates to the initiation of these talks, the President did authorize members of his team in early 2013 to open up this channel and begin conversations with the Castro regime.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is this seen as a Hanukkah present?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I saw -- Mr. Gross certainly seemed to think so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Christi.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The President -- on the question of whether the President would go to Cuba, presumably you would need to see some performance on the part of the Cuban regime before that happened.\xc2\xa0 Are we talking about a number of months and some performance on reforms?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, as I mentioned to Major, it is not unprecedented for the President of the United States to travel to countries with whom we have serious concerns about their respect for basic human rights.\xc2\xa0 For example, the President just last month traveled to both China and Burma, met with the leaders of those countries to try to advance American national security interests.\xc2\xa0 In those conversations, the President brought up with leaders their failure to do as much as we believe they should to protect and respect basic human rights, including political freedoms of their people.</p>\n<p>So it is possible for the President to travel to other countries to represent the interests of the United States of America even when we have serious concerns about the human rights policies of that country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this would seem to be somewhat different.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it would be the first presidential visit in 50 years. \xc2\xa0Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you need to see -- aren\xe2\x80\x99t there things that you would need to see first before you could entertain taking a step that significant?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to set up any sort of checklist that would be considered a precondition for a presidential visit.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that we may do at a later date.\xc2\xa0 I would just note, again, that there are a number of countries that do have, at best, checkered human rights records that the President has visited.\xc2\xa0 And again, he did that in pursuit of core national security interests, and used the opportunity of those visits to bring attention to these issues.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen progress that was made by the Cuban government just today, that they announced the release of more than 50 political prisoners.\xc2\xa0 They released -- or they agreed to allow the import of American communications equipment that will expand access to the Internet and other information for the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 And they agreed to deepen their engagement with the United Nations and the Red Cross, two organizations that serve to advance and champion the basic human rights that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here.</p>\n<p>So that does represent some progress, and it certainly represents more progress than we saw under the more than 50 years of the previous failed policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I also just ask you about this Cuban intelligence asset who was in prison for 20 years?\xc2\xa0 Did you know who he was before?\xc2\xa0 Had the President heard of him?\xc2\xa0 And has he had an opportunity to call that person?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President has had an opportunity to call that individual.\xc2\xa0 I was not aware of this individual.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that this -- I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not a scholar of U.S.-Cuban relations, though, so that may be a low bar.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But this is an individual whose existence was not previously widely known.\xc2\xa0 But there were individual who were deeply engaged in our intelligence community who were aware of the valuable contribution that this individual had made to American national security.\xc2\xa0 That is what made him a valued intelligence asset, and we are pleased that he\xe2\x80\x99s now on American soil.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How soon do you think the President would name an ambassador to Cuba?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any personnel announcements at this time.\xc2\xa0 But I will say it sounds like a pretty interesting job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you mentioned at the top of the briefing that this is an historic day.\xc2\xa0 Is it diminished somewhat by the continued existence of the facility at Guantanamo Bay?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something -- another promise that the President made before he was elected to office.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And one that the President continues to work doggedly to close.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, because of the interference that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Congress, we have not been able to do what the President thinks is in the clear national security interest of the United States, which is to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work even in the face of obstacles from Congress to achieve that goal, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve read out a number of conversations on this topic.\xc2\xa0 Did the President discuss at all with Governor Scott of Florida the moves that he was making, given that obviously this is an issue that affects the 90-mile-away state so much?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And because I know that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t just prepare on foreign policy today -- I know that that\xe2\x80\x99s been the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of today\xe2\x80\x99s briefing.\xc2\xa0 New York state banning fracking -- the President has emphasized an all-of-the-above energy strategy.\xc2\xa0 What does the President think about a state with large shale reserves banning a policy that provides a lot of natural gas?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jared, I did see the announcement of Governor Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s policy shortly before I came out here.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t render a detailed analysis of that policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in general, does the President support governors of states banning fracking?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In general, what I can say is the President has placed a high priority in ensuring that ongoing fracking operations don\xe2\x80\x99t negatively affect the health and wellbeing of people who happen to live in the area where these fracking operations are being conducted.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he believe that it should be something that is resolved on a state-by-state issue, or does he support a national policy?\xc2\xa0 Can you give me anything more than --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has acknowledged that there is a role for both the state government and for federal environmental authorities to have on this.\xc2\xa0 But again, as a specific policy matter, I just haven\xe2\x80\x99t had an opportunity to review Governor Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s policy and to draw many conclusions about what impact it would have on ours.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he welcomes generally states going above and beyond when they think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President certainly believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important for these fracking operations to be conducted in a way that doesn\'t undermine or threaten the health and wellbeing of people who live in these areas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 JC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 An historical briefing room fantasy question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\'re treading into dangerous territory, JC.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a family program.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s historical -- a historical question.\xc2\xa0 What would President Obama say today to President Kennedy who initiated these embargoes 53 years ago?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what he would say.\xc2\xa0 I do think that even President Kennedy would acknowledge that, after more than 50 years of a policy of isolation didn\'t bring about the desired result that I think even President Kennedy would acknowledge, that change was needed.\xc2\xa0 And certainly throughout his career in public service, President Kennedy was somebody who did believe in the value of openness and engagement and in the value of empowering local populations to take greater control over their economic and political situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it does strike me that while the President is changing a policy that President Kennedy originally put in place, that the philosophy that the President is pursuing and the values that the President is pursuing is entirely consistent with the kinds of values that President Kennedy championed throughout his life.</p>\n<p>John, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Did the President reach out to any Republicans he knew were sympathetic on this policy change beforehand?\xc2\xa0 And I refer specifically to Dr. Ron Paul, whose position is identical to the President on the Cuban embargo, or his son, Rand Paul, who has yet to take a position on the embargo or has yet to put out a statement on the policy change today.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Interesting.\xc2\xa0 Well, I assume all of you will be asking him about that.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you as a general matter is that the President and members of his team convened a number of conversations over the last couple of days with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill about this policy change.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you that there were Democrats and Republicans who were pleased with the anticipated announcement, and that there were Democrats and Republicans on the other side of this issue as well.\xc2\xa0 I think that is one of the things that makes this such an interesting policy to discuss is that the viewpoints on this topic don\'t cleanly break down along party lines.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read one more statement before I go, because I didn\'t have the opportunity to do it before.\xc2\xa0 Bob Stallman is the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, not somebody who has a long track record of supporting policies that are put in place by the Obama administration.\xc2\xa0 But today he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe American Farm Bureau strongly supports President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s move toward normalized relations with Cuba.\xc2\xa0 The Farm Bureau has long called for removal of trade restrictions with Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And we believe expanded trade with the U.S. can serve as the cornerstone for additional reforms.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So again, there is strong support among Democrats and Republicans for the kind of policy that the President has laid out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You want to give us any of the names of the Republicans who were at the meetings that he --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any details about those calls to read out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Josh --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President mentioned a Canadian role in all this.\xc2\xa0 What was that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The Canadians -- as the President\xe2\x80\x99s team sought to find a place to meet with the Cubans, we turned to our friends to the north in Canada.\xc2\xa0 And they, on a number of occasions, hosted private confidential meetings between senior members of the American delegation and senior members of the Cuban delegation.\xc2\xa0 Many of the conversations took place in Canada.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Ottawa or --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I believe in Ottawa, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, interesting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, a lot, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good afternoon.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t3:09 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
