Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:07 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any announcements at the top, so, Darlene, if you want to kick it off.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0The administration announced earlier today that it was going to be expanding efforts to help Central American families and children come to the U.S. legally. \xc2\xa0And I was wondering if you could speak to timing of that announcement -- today, this week -- given that the Democratic convention is going on and they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to put on a more -- friendlier face in terms of immigration.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Sure, I\'m happy to talk about this. \xc2\xa0As you tracked closely, Darlene, over the past year, the United States has taken a range of steps to address the humanitarian crisis in Central America. \xc2\xa0Today we announced three new steps. \xc2\xa0The first is announcing in-country processing for vulnerable populations inside El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. \xc2\xa0This allows us to process requests for resettlement on the ground. \xc2\xa0That includes screening and interviews by officials from the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second piece we announced today was that Costa Rica has announced a partnership with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees to help address regional migration challenges. \xc2\xa0So what that means is populations that are unable to be processed in those three countries, we can now do that in Costa Rica. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe third piece we announced was the expansion of the Central American minors program. \xc2\xa0Currently, children in the three countries I just listed -- El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras -- we have programs that facilitate the resettlement into the United States for those children, and this program would -- the expansion today would expand the infrastructure that governs that program. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of these have the goal of protecting Central Americans at risk while providing an orderly and safe resettlement here in the United States. \xc2\xa0In terms of the timing, what actually dictated the timing, Darlene, is our announcement with Costa Rica. \xc2\xa0This is the culmination of some negotiations with the government of Costa Rica, and as soon as that was finalized is when we decided to announce this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A question about the convention. \xc2\xa0The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a public schedule today. \xc2\xa0Can you sort of give us a little fill on what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing to prepare for his speech tomorrow night?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0The President is working on his speech. \xc2\xa0He was actually up late last night working on his speech. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s been working on the speech for a few weeks now. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have too much to preview on what to expect tomorrow night. \xc2\xa0I do think, as some of you have noted, tomorrow night will be the 12th anniversary of then-Senate-candidate Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s speech in Boston where he was introduced to the national stage. \xc2\xa0I think it\'s a good bet that he\'ll reflect on that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the President will talk about what the country has accomplished together since then, what the grit, ingenuity and determination of the American people helped to achieve over the past eight years -- whether that\'s coming back from the brink of economic collapse to the longest stretch of private sector job growth in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, or whether that\'s changing the way the world views the United States for the better.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from him over the past few weeks, the President has been candid about why he thinks electing the Republican nominee is a risky path for the United States, but I would suggest to you that I think tomorrow night\xe2\x80\x99s speech will much more focus on how Secretary Clinton has the judgment, the toughness and the intellect to succeed in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>\n\tLastly, I think the President will talk about who we are as a country and that we are better united than divided, and that we\'re better together than apart. \xc2\xa0I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear that as a theme, not just because it\'s a stark contrast between the two candidates on the ballot this year, but also because it\'s a principle that has animated the President\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime of public service. \xc2\xa0It also happens to be a distinctive American tradition, one that the President believes is fundamental to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s identity.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have any sense of, out of all the speeches -- the big speeches he\xe2\x80\x99s given as President, how would he rank -- where would he rank tomorrow night\xe2\x80\x99s speech among those? \xc2\xa0 And also, what\xe2\x80\x99s his plan for topping Michelle Obama? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0She set the bar very high. \xc2\xa0I\'ll say a few things about that. \xc2\xa0One is the President is aware of the importance of the speech. \xc2\xa0Obviously the national conventions come around once every four years. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re a high-profile moment. \xc2\xa0And the President believes that, as he said, the stakes are high in this campaign, that the choice for voters could not be starker. \xc2\xa0And he believes that this is an opportunity for him to not only make the case for why the record of accomplishment over the past eight years should indicate that we should continue on this path and not regress, but also why Secretary Clinton is uniquely qualified to make the decisions that a commander-in-chief would have to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tAyesha.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the UAW president said today that Hillary Clinton has indicated that she will try to renegotiate NAFTA if she\xe2\x80\x99s elected as president. \xc2\xa0I was wondering, does the administration have any response to that and this idea that NAFTA needs to be renegotiated?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Ayesha, I did not work on Senator Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign in 2008, but I do know that as a candidate he pledged to renegotiate NAFTA as well. \xc2\xa0And the good news is his promise has been fulfilled. \xc2\xa0Renegotiating NAFTA is part of a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that was reached earlier last year. \xc2\xa0And that\'s one of the reasons the President is so proud of TPP and why he believes Congress should pass it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he\xe2\x80\x99s acutely aware -- the President is acutely aware that previous trade agreements haven\'t lived up to the hype. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s acutely aware that that presents challenges for the politics of trade right now, but that\'s all the more reason why, when TPP was being negotiated, he insisted that we impose the strongest, most robust human rights, labor, environmental protection standards ever to be placed in a trade agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But there seem to also be concerns about TPP, so it seems like people aren\'t necessarily taking that as a renegotiation of NAFTA. \xc2\xa0It seems like these calls on the campaign trail are a bit different. \xc2\xa0Or does the administration not see that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, our view is those with concerns about how NAFTA has been implemented should look no further than TPP as a means to fix those wrongs; that once TPP is approved through Congress, a lot of the problems that we saw in NAFTA -- which I think principally were that a lot of the trade enforcement mechanisms were not built into the agreement, rather, they were in side agreements -- TPP fixes all of that. \xc2\xa0So we believe those with concerns about how NAFTA is being implemented have a solution right in front of them, and that\'s passing TPP. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Today, the Cyber National Action Plan was issued. \xc2\xa0I was wondering, how would this plan prevent or affect what happened with the DNC and the emails? \xc2\xa0And under this new plan, how would the U.S. respond if it turns out that it was a foreign actor who carried out a hack or a similar -- who carried out the hack of the DNC or a similar hack if it happened in the future?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Ayesha, thank you for raising the announcement today. \xc2\xa0As you know, the President\'s top counterterrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco, unveiled this today in the remarks at Fordham University. \xc2\xa0I\'m happy to tell you that this particular policy has been in the works for several years -- for the past year, but is the culmination of about seven or eight years of the United States government working through responses to these episodes.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, they\'re happening all too often, and so we have a lot of practice. \xc2\xa0And what we decided to do was to build out the best practices that we\'ve seen in terms of our ability to respond to these intrusions, and that\'s what the announcement today did, which was codify the best practices that we\'ve seen. \xc2\xa0It also builds on lessons learned from natural disaster response and counterterrorism response, and so that we can write a playbook for both this administration and, to be candid, for the next administration so they don\'t have to recreate the wheel every time there\'s an intrusion.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you point out, the policy largely sets forth how the federal government responds to cyber intrusions. \xc2\xa0First, the FBI will be the lead agency in responding to the immediate threat. \xc2\xa0Again, this is consistent with how terrorism cases are handled. \xc2\xa0But in the past, we know this is an important organizational distinction because it\'s not always clear at the outset of a cyber incident whether the actor is a nation-state or a criminal.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut under these new rules, the FBI will be positioned to bring the full range of law enforcement and national investigative tools to bear. \xc2\xa0That includes collecting evidence, gathering intelligence, determining attribution, and bringing malicious cyber actors to justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second piece of this was that the Department of Homeland Security would take the lead in helping organizations and institutions deal with the impact of an attack or an intrusion. \xc2\xa0We call this asset response. \xc2\xa0I should say those who do it call it asset response. \xc2\xa0But basically what this boils down to is Department of Homeland Security will provide technical assistance to protect assets to bring the systems back up and running and to shore up vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd thirdly, the last piece is that the Office of Director of National Intelligence will be responsible for integrating the intelligence and analysis about the threat and identifying opportunities to mitigate and disrupt it. \xc2\xa0We are not going to look retroactively at past cases in order to see where they fall on a scale that was announced. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the DNC situation is still under investigation, so if there\'s a determination where on the scale that would fall, I\'m sure that will be released in due time.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0On the same subject, regardless of who orchestrated this act, even though there is some evidence pointing in a particular direction, are you treating this -- okay, let\'s just say that this is a state actor. \xc2\xa0Are you treating this as a state actor potentially trying to influence the 2016 election?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Michelle, I don\'t have any significant update today to offer on the investigation. \xc2\xa0As Josh mentioned yesterday, the FBI has made clear they\'re investigating this matter. \xc2\xa0Obviously, that will be a careful and thorough investigation. \xc2\xa0Josh also made clear that the FBI will be the first to release any information that they learn in the context of this investigation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis was obviously the case in 2014 with the Sony hack that you all referenced yesterday. \xc2\xa0At that time, though, back in 2014, we also said that releasing an internal assessment on attribution wouldn\'t necessarily be the standard playbook. \xc2\xa0To the contrary, this decision will be made on a case-by-case basis, and investigators will look at two things. \xc2\xa0One is the clarity of evidence pointing to a particular culprit, and the second is whether it\'s in the United States\' best interest to release that information or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as you point out, I know a couple of news organizations and other voices are pointing at certain actors. \xc2\xa0From here, I\'m going to have to yield to the FBI investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just speaking of that, in the past, we\'ve named and shamed other countries, pretty obviously, but never Russia, even though some have suspected Russia, saying that there was a preponderance of the evidence to blame Russia for certain hacks. So are you saying that it\'s never been, then, in the U.S.\'s best interest to name Russia, even though that evidence, according to some, is out there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0That\'s not what I\'m saying, Michelle. \xc2\xa0What I\'m saying is, once this investigation concludes, the investigators themselves will decide whether it\'s in the United States\' best interest to name the culprit. \xc2\xa0And I do think that we have a long record of holding bad actors accountable for their actions in this space. \xc2\xa0We have a full range of options available to us in the government. \xc2\xa0That includes economic sanctions out of Department of Treasury. \xc2\xa0That includes a number of law enforcement measures that Department of Justice has announced and has taken action on. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also includes, by the way, Department of Defense disrupting ISIL in the cyber battlefield. \xc2\xa0So we feel very confident in our capabilities. \xc2\xa0But I am going to let the FBI investigation unfold into this particular incident before we make any decisions about what we want to do in response.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But whoever did this, the timing looks pretty -- obviously as if they were trying to affect the election, no? \xc2\xa0Would you agree with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize the motive of who conducted this attack. \xc2\xa0I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that investigators will look at motive. \xc2\xa0I think that\'s reasonable to assume. \xc2\xa0But I also think it\xe2\x80\x99s true that the United States isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to pull any punches in terms of our response; that, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned, the United States has shown -- has a record of aggressively responding in situations that warrant a response. \xc2\xa0But we are going to wait for the investigation to conclude before we make any of those determinations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And speaking of naming, the President has been in the habit lately -- and now it seems the First Lady is, too -- of not ever saying Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s name, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no question who they\'re talking about at times. \xc2\xa0So why the aversion to actually say the name of the person they\'re speaking about?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, Michelle, I think if you\'re asking about the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s speech last night, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to talk about it. \xc2\xa0I know there\xe2\x80\x99s been plenty of commentary over the past week about the darkness of the proceedings in Cleveland, and the President said on Friday that he was struck by the dire picture painted by Republicans at their convention. \xc2\xa0And I think what made the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s speech such a powerful one last night is that it was a speech that only one person could write and deliver. \xc2\xa0The country and the world watched with intense interest in 2009 when the First Family moved in the White House making history, and eight years later that family and this country has an impressive story to tell. \xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we heard from the First Lady last night.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last thing I would do -- given how remarkable that speech was -- would be to second-guess any of those word choices.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So then why doesn\'t the President ever say Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s name when he\xe2\x80\x99s speaking about him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I think you\'ve heard the President mention the Republican nominee on occasion. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think he\xe2\x80\x99s shied away from that. \xc2\xa0And more importantly, I don\'t think he\xe2\x80\x99s shied away from making the argument of why he thinks that his election would be a risky path for the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Obviously he has shied away from it. \xc2\xa0Sometimes when he\xe2\x80\x99s speaking publicly, he seems to go out of his way to always say \xe2\x80\x9cthe Republican nominee.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering why. \xc2\xa0And now that he\xe2\x80\x99s on the trail and will be doing other events, and he\xe2\x80\x99s about to give a speech at the DNC, I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, why doesn\'t he ever want to --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, we should both go back and look at the remarks. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that he has mentioned him before. \xc2\xa0I have some recollections of being there while he has. \xc2\xa0But I think the argument that he\xe2\x80\x99s making as you all pick up without hesitation is usually crystal-clear.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Justin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0First I just want to follow on something that Michelle was asking you about. \xc2\xa0You mentioned it\xe2\x80\x99s not just media speculation that Russia is responsible for the hack. \xc2\xa0Nancy Pelosi said today that there was no question. \xc2\xa0John Podesta, just very similar. \xc2\xa0So is your view here that those top allies of the White House are baselessly speculating? \xc2\xa0Or are members of the administration giving those allies information, in which case, potentially putting at risk the national security interest that you were talking about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I heard about Leader Pelosi\xe2\x80\x99s remarks shortly before coming out here, and you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask her what she was basing that on. \xc2\xa0We do know that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of analysis in the public space, making some determinations about who was behind this. \xc2\xa0A lot of that analysis is based on people with expertise and experience in this field. \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask those who are offering a judgment about what they base that on.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor me, here, I have to yield to the FBI investigation because that investigation continues. \xc2\xa0We want that to be thoughtful, meticulous and unfettered. \xc2\xa0And so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do anything from here to prejudice that investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, so, I mean, the administration has aggressively gone after instances where there have been leaks to reporters about ongoing national security investigations. \xc2\xa0Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the same thing apply here, especially in what appears to be leaks or conversations, or sanctioned conversations, to top political allies of the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them what they\xe2\x80\x99re basing their comments on. \xc2\xa0We know that there was one report done by a very credible entity that laid out the case for this, so it might be just based on something that\xe2\x80\x99s already in the public space. \xc2\xa0You should just ask them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0TPP was obviously a big theme last night. \xc2\xa0Does the White House believe Secretary Clinton when she says that she would not support TPP as President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, we take Secretary Clinton at her word, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask her to expound on that if you\xe2\x80\x99re skeptical. \xc2\xa0I think that our view is that we\xe2\x80\x99re at a crossroads, and that if we stipulate that the world is more interconnected than ever before, if the commercial ties between countries are strengthening and not diluting, that we have a choice -- either other countries can write the rules of the road for trade, or the American people can step up and take a leadership role.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur view is that the American people and the United States of America should write the rules. \xc2\xa0We know, Justin, that China is trying to negotiate its own trade deal in this region. \xc2\xa0We also know that if that deal were to be codified it would not have the labor, environmental and human rights protections that TPP has.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be up to leaders of Congress, obviously, who stand to approve the deal. \xc2\xa0But our view is that not only is it in America\xe2\x80\x99s best interest to write the rules of the road for trade, it\xe2\x80\x99s in America\xe2\x80\x99s business interest that American companies and American workers are advantaged by the deals that we arrange.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The reason that I ask is, if you take Secretary Clinton seriously -- Donald Trump has obviously said he\xe2\x80\x99s against TPP. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve lost Tim Kaine now, who was (inaudible) in the Senate. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Bernie Sanders rally the Democratic Party on the floor of the convention last night to block TPP in a lame duck Congress. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering -- I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve made the argument a million times just about why you think TPP is important, but what is the possible viable path for TPP at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Justin, I remember the same skepticism when the President was trying to get TPA past Congress, and I believe we had very much the same exchanges that were rooted -- rightfully so -- in how challenging the politics of this issue can be.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we acknowledge that the politics here can be complicated, but we also acknowledge this is the right thing to do. \xc2\xa0And the President believes this is not only the right thing to do because we want to advantage American workers and American businesses, but also because if we don\xe2\x80\x99t write the rules of the road on international trade, then China is going to. \xc2\xa0And we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that\xe2\x80\x99s in America\xe2\x80\x99s best interest.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I understand your skepticism here. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s well-founded. \xc2\xa0But we had the same conversations about Trade Promotion Authority and it turns out Republicans and Democrats came together to get that done. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one, on the refugee announcements. \xc2\xa0The administration, I think you guys admitted, struggled when the President asked for a greater influx of Syrian refugees here -- \xc2\xa0lagged behind scheduled and needed additional resources from Congress. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, with this new program, if it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require more resources from Congress, and if you expect some of the newly eligible refugees under this program to either detract from other countries that are sending refugees our way, detract resources from vetting in other areas, or whether refugee caps are going to go up and spending on refugees is going to go up.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard an analysis that speaks to those questions. \xc2\xa0But our goal here is to conduct the resettlement process in the home countries so that we\xe2\x80\x99re not dealing with an influx on the border and we\xe2\x80\x99re not dealing with a heartbreaking or unsustainable situation that is neither safe, or orderly.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo our view is, let\xe2\x80\x99s get a lot of the process pieces done on the front end before they come to the country, and once we\xe2\x80\x99re assured of the security measures, then we can resettle them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, I mean, because federal resources are a zero-sum game, is it -- the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re doing this in other countries means that the costs overall are going down, or the program isn\xe2\x80\x99t kind of substantial enough that it\xe2\x80\x99s changed -- how is this being paid for, I guess is --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, one of the streams of funding here is from the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 High Commission on Refugees. \xc2\xa0They actually agreed to provide care, food and necessities for individuals housed in Costa Rica. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s again one of the new pieces of the program today.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s a variety of funding streams. \xc2\xa0We can get you more information about how it\xe2\x80\x99s paid for. \xc2\xa0But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that this is going to prompt an enormous -- this is not going to require a new, enormous sum of money.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hi. \xc2\xa0I was just wondering about the speech tomorrow. \xc2\xa0You talked in general themes, but will the President be talking about specific policies like TPP, like Affordable Care Act, Wall Street reform? \xc2\xa0Or is this just going to be a thematic speech?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, first, stay tuned. \xc2\xa0And I can tell you the speech is still being worked on. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have specifics beyond some of the themes that I mentioned earlier to read out to you right now, but the President is working on the speech diligently and around the clock. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that what you can expect is a reflection on the past eight years in office, what the American people have gone through over the past eight years -- again, their grit, their ingenuity, their determination to come back from a very different place than we were in 2009 when this President too office. \xc2\xa0And whether he hits on the fact that health care costs are growing at the lowest pace in decades or that more Americans are graduating high school than ever before, or that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the longest stretch of private sector job growth in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to tune in.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Eric. \xc2\xa0Can you give me an update on the fire situation in California? \xc2\xa0Has the President been in contact with the governor of the state? \xc2\xa0And what, if any, federal assistance is due for the Golden State?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0Kevin, I don\'t have any conversations between the President and the governor to read out to you right now. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that White House officials are in touch with their counterparts in the state of California, and they offered any assistance possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, our FEMA Director, Craig Fugate, is one of the best. \xc2\xa0And so I know that the President has directed his team here at the White House to make sure that all available assets are at the disposal of local first responders in California.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And there has been no declaration of disaster, anything like that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that they signed one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Got you. \xc2\xa0Last night, Sarah Silverman said something interesting, she said that Bernie supporters were being \xe2\x80\x9cridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Many of them feel like the administration has sort of turned their back on them. \xc2\xa0They feel like, in many cases, that they support a lot of the policies that the President seems to support. \xc2\xa0Is it unfair to say that the Democratic Party has turned its back on Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s supporters?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, I think as Josh mentioned yesterday, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of experts on the ground in Philadelphia to assess the strength and unity of the party right now. \xc2\xa0Maybe Sarah Silverman accounts herself -- is one of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would just observe Josh\xe2\x80\x99s theory from yesterday, which is that when the First Lady spoke to the crowd, they would be on their feet. \xc2\xa0And I certainly don\'t mean to knock anything that my boss says from this podium, but if anything, I think he underestimated the reception that the First Lady received. \xc2\xa0She was met with warmth, with enthusiasm, with an embrace that I think was unique for speakers at a convention like that. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s not just because of her message. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not just because she\xe2\x80\x99s a spectacular First Lady. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s because she represents the record of this administration and the values that drive her and her husband.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing I\xe2\x80\x99d point out is that the individual who had the most invested in defeating Secretary Clinton for the nomination could not have been more steadfast in his support the party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee. \xc2\xa0If you watched Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s speech, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just a perfunctory exercise or one that didn\'t come from the heart. \xc2\xa0I think you heard Senator Sanders use his trademark passion to make the case for not only the ideals which animated his campaign, but also for how the party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee will help achieve those goals as President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you also saw a three-minute-long standing ovation for a movement and a person that a great many of the people in the hall last night and presumably tonight and even into the day after feel like they have not had their voices heard. \xc2\xa0Is the White House concerned about the mood of a large portion of the party moving forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Kevin, the President has remarked several times how much respect he has for Senator Sanders, and in particular the strong campaign that he built. \xc2\xa0The excitement that he generated was historic. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that all of that energy, passion, and drive was on full display last night.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the good news for Democrats is that Senator Sanders committed unequivocally to ensure Secretary Clinton becomes the next President. \xc2\xa0But as the President has said, he absolutely recognizes the value that Senator Sanders brought to this race, an energy that captured the hearts and minds of millions of Americans. \xc2\xa0That\'s why the President is grateful that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be working hard to elect Secretary Clinton.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we should also talk about the shared values between Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton and the President of the United States. \xc2\xa0That includes everything from building and economy from the middle class out. \xc2\xa0That includes striving hard towards social justice, civil rights, and equality. \xc2\xa0That means doing everything this country can to pass comprehensive immigration reform, to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and people who are prone to violence. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of shared values there. \xc2\xa0And I think you heard a lot of them on display last night. \xc2\xa0But I suspect you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear more about that in the coming nights.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- know if the President has reached out to the President of France? \xc2\xa0Yet another devastating attack on humanity -- what can you tell us about the assault on a Catholic priest today in France?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Kevin, I don\'t have a call to read out to you from the President. \xc2\xa0But I can tell you that the United States condemns in the strongest possible terms the horrific terrorist attack today at a Catholic church in Normandy. \xc2\xa0We offer our condolences to the family and friends of the murdered priest. \xc2\xa0And our thoughts and prayers are with the other victims of the attack, as well as the parishioners and community members of this church.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrance and the United States share a commitment to protecting religious liberty for those of all faiths. \xc2\xa0And today\xe2\x80\x99s violence will not shake that commitment. \xc2\xa0We commend French law enforcement for their quick and decisive response and stand ready to assist the French authorities in their investigation going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one I have for you is on Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0There is a limit to the number of troops that can be there. \xc2\xa0The cap -- I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s 8,400 or so. \xc2\xa0Is there a concern about this cap as it relates to the folks on the ground being able to complete and do the task at hand?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Kevin, as you covered, I believe, two or three weeks ago now, we announced an adjustment in our drawdown in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0And that was the result of analysis and feedback we have gotten from our commanders on the ground and from the rest of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t have any new changes to announce today. \xc2\xa0But I can tell you that the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team closely monitors Afghanistan, obviously, and is in constant touch with our military advisors on the ground to making sure that they\'re getting the support and resources they need to carry out their mission.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So is there any flexibility or fungibility in terms of the numbers if they come back to the White House and say, hey, listen, we really could use an extra thousand troops or so. \xc2\xa0Is that part of the process? \xc2\xa0Or is that not possible?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard a request like that come through channels. \xc2\xa0Obviously, I would assume that they\xe2\x80\x99d want to see how this adjustment is working out before making any new requests. \xc2\xa0But again, we\'re constantly making sure that the decisions the President has made in regard to American troop deployment around the world -- we\'re constantly making sure that those are serving the best interests of not only the troops, but also the war theaters that they\'re in.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Eric. \xc2\xa0First on the refugee announcement. \xc2\xa0In the past when we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about this issue, his message has been very much one about deterrence -- don\'t make a difficult journey. \xc2\xa0Don\'t risk sending your children with smugglers -- that, in fact, these people, even if they\'re facing a desperate situation at home, really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be coming. \xc2\xa0And now today we\'re hearing that the refugee qualification process is being expanded pretty substantially. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering what happened to change the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Central America. \xc2\xa0Has he decided for some reason that this is a refugee situation and that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t convinced it was before? \xc2\xa0What played into that decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Julie, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Central America is heartbreaking. \xc2\xa0And I think the President has voiced that consistently for a while now. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing humanitarian challenges in Central America, particularly for many vulnerable individuals attempting to leave the region and come to the United States. \xc2\xa0So it was important for us to take action to promote a safe and orderly migration.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the concerns that you\'re referencing are concerns of the journey from Central America back to the border -- or up to the border of the United States. \xc2\xa0That journey has proved perilous, dangerous, and even deadly. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s also done at the request and under the guise of bad actors who don\'t have these children\xe2\x80\x99s best interests in mind. \xc2\xa0They\'re human smugglers. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so the President\xe2\x80\x99s warnings about not engaging in those types of activities remain as steadfast today as they were in the past. \xc2\xa0The difference is today we\'re able to announce that a lot of the processing for this can happen in-country, so that we can begin to address the humanitarian crisis without making these children take a harrowing and sometimes deadly trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0But you\'re also opening up that process to a whole universe -- a much bigger universe of people than it was open to before. \xc2\xa0Before it was just unaccompanied children. \xc2\xa0Now it\xe2\x80\x99s their parents, their older siblings, caregivers. \xc2\xa0It seems like an acknowledgment that there is a much larger population of people who are vulnerable here than the President had made in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, we\'ve constantly been evaluating the best approach to tackle the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Central America. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s happening there, as I said, is heartbreaking and it\xe2\x80\x99s distressing. \xc2\xa0And that is why the President had heretofore not been satisfied with the steps that we\'ve been taking. \xc2\xa0That\'s why we\'ve been able to expand some of these programs. \xc2\xa0That\'s why he\xe2\x80\x99s proud that the government of Costa Rica has agreed to host processing in their country. \xc2\xa0And that all furthers the goal of making sure that any resettlement is done in a safe and orderly way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one more on the First Lady\'s speech last night. \xc2\xa0Even though she had a pretty warm reception in the hall, there are some critics who have responded to her comments about slaves having built the White House, saying that it was somehow race-baiting or a divisive thing to say. \xc2\xa0Does the White House see it that way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0No.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0John Kerry met with the Russian Foreign Minister today and said he raised the issue of the DNC hacking. \xc2\xa0If Russia is not a suspect here, why have America\'s chief diplomat take that message to Russia\'s chief diplomat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I believe that if you ask Secretary Kerry, he will tell you that this is -- the issue of cybersecurity is one that he raises all across the globe; that, unfortunately, the intrusion at the DNC is not an incident that\'s unique. \xc2\xa0In fact, when you assess the activity in this space, that we see this all too often. \xc2\xa0And so I\'m fairly certain this wasn\'t the first time Secretary Kerry raised this with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov. \xc2\xa0I suspect that Foreign Minister Lavrov is one of many foreign leaders that Secretary Kerry has raised this with.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But he said specifically he raised the DNC hacking. \xc2\xa0And Lavrov said to the press, at least, he wanted to use four-letter words to respond to it. \xc2\xa0So, I mean, this was obviously something that has a lot more weight than just a general discussion of cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I won\'t use any four-letter words here, much to your relief. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You would definitely get on TV. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Look, you\'ll have to ask Secretary Kerry to the extent to which -- what the details of the conversation that he conducted with the Foreign Minister.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did the White House give him a message to deliver to Russia?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know that to be true. \xc2\xa0I believe that Secretary Kerry raises this as an issue pretty regularly with his counterparts. \xc2\xa0Obviously, we have concerns across the board in this space, and the President takes it seriously. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why it\'s one of the chief issues that when we engage our foreign counterparts around the world that we work on -- as you\'ll recall, when President Xi was here last year, a lot of work went into establishing an agreement with the Chinese. \xc2\xa0So this isn\'t something that we take as a one-off engagement. \xc2\xa0This is something that we take a holistic approach to. \xc2\xa0And so I believe Secretary Kerry raising it with Foreign Minister Lavrov is consistent with that approach.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So is it fair to say that the White House is considering this as not a political issue but a national security one?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, I think we\'d wait until the FBI makes any determination before I\'m in a position to sort of characterize our response. \xc2\xa0And as I mentioned to Michelle, I think that motive is likely to be part of the FBI investigation, but I just can\'t get ahead of that from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you confirm that the administration had previously warned the DNC regarding vulnerabilities of their systems?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know that to be true. \xc2\xa0I do know that, as the federal government, we take a lot of responsibility in promoting best practices. \xc2\xa0There\'s a term here at the White House that I\'m reluctant to use but we call it cyber hygiene -- yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible.) \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I\'m not going to get into graphic descriptions. \xc2\xa0But we want to make sure that everyone across the board, both in the private sector, in the political space, in people\'s personal computing, that they\'re using best practices, because we know that there are bad actors out there looking to do harm. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I think, unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, we have too much practice responding to these attacks. \xc2\xa0That\'s why the President thought it would be important to sort of codify our responses and make sure that we\'ve written a playbook that distills down best practices from our previous responses.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So at a minimum, the cyber hygiene kind of program, it would be normal for the administration to advise the DNC, weigh in on their security?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I think that we\'re often in touch with agencies and organizations and companies when they have questions about their cybersecurity. \xc2\xa0I know that that\'s a program that\'s housed at the Department of Homeland Security, so I wouldn\'t be surprised if there were conversations taking place. \xc2\xa0I know that lots of large companies reach out to the administration when they have questions about possible intrusions or possible questionable activity on their servers or in their systems. \xc2\xa0So I wouldn\'t be surprised if those conversations were happening. \xc2\xa0But I also wouldn\'t be surprised if those conversations were happening across the board. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you say what level of communication the administration is having at this point with the DNC? \xc2\xa0Is it purely just at the FBI level? \xc2\xa0And is the conversation today between Kerry and Lavrov the highest-level conversation so far directly with Russia about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any additional communications with the Russians to read out at this time. \xc2\xa0In terms of conversations with the DNC, as I mentioned, the FBI is the principal investigative agency on this, so I assume any communications would be going through those channels. \xc2\xa0But you might want to check with the DNC if they\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from other components of the administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If I could just follow up on the Lavrov meeting, just so I can understand the White House kind of rendering of the discussion. \xc2\xa0It was completely routine and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do or any connection to the leaked emails that were published by WikiLeaks? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, I think you should ask Secretary Kerry about what he brought up in that conversation --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you\'re unaware of any message from the White House delivered to Secretary Kerry that he should inquire along these lines?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of any directive to do that. \xc2\xa0But obviously Secretary Kerry is our chief diplomat around the world, so you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask him to what extent he raised this in the meeting. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The question for the White House is, was there a message from the White House to Kerry. \xc2\xa0And you\'re telling us that you don\'t know that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Yes, I\'m telling you I\'m not aware of one.</p>\n<p>\n\tMegan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Eric. \xc2\xa0I wanted to clarify one of your earlier responses on the cyber framework. \xc2\xa0You mentioned that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be applied retroactively, but you also mentioned that this DNC investigation is ongoing. \xc2\xa0So will the DNC investigation go through the cyber framework? \xc2\xa0Will we see -- isn\'t this hack being characterized on the zero-to-five scale?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0So the answer to that question is good news, because this is a codification of systems and methods that are already in place. \xc2\xa0So you can be assured that this hack is going through that scheme because this is just based on methods and processes that we\'ve been using for some time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So has it been assigned a zero-to-five designation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0We can check on that. \xc2\xa0I think they will wait to do that until the FBI determines the results of its investigation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then, second, the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech and the President\xe2\x80\x99s message generally -- the President recently saying the world has never been less violent. \xc2\xa0And you just mentioned he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be trying to counter some of the darkness that we heard in Cleveland. \xc2\xa0But just this weekend we saw another shooting in Florida, an attack in Afghanistan that left 80 dead, a German suicide bomber. \xc2\xa0And then, just in the past, I think, 16 hours or something -- as of this morning we had Ned Price sending out three condolence statements after violent attacks in France, Somalia and Japan. \xc2\xa0So can you address what seems to be a bit of a contradiction in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s message and what people may be hearing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, I think -- and the President did this, if not on Friday, a little bit earlier in remarks -- but I think it\'s important to disentangle those two things. \xc2\xa0One, we\'ve got perpetrated terrorist attacks happening on foreign soil, and then you\xe2\x80\x99ve also got gun violence in the United States of America. \xc2\xa0So we can sort of take those things in turn.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe terrorist attacks happening on foreign soil are horrific and are unfortunate. \xc2\xa0And that is why the President has taken a leadership role in making sure that he\xe2\x80\x99s summoning I think now 67 international partners to build a coalition to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL. \xc2\xa0That effort remains ongoing. \xc2\xa0It remains robust. \xc2\xa0And it remains a top goal of this President for the remainder of his term in office.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of the violence we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in cities, which I think you\xe2\x80\x99re also referencing, there is preliminary data so far from 2015 from the FBI that shows an uptick in murders and violent crime compared to last year in some cities, but if you look at overall trends, violent crime right now remains at historic lows. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be paying attention to this. To the contrary, the President has asked that his Department of Justice -- to play close attention to any increase in violent crimes, even if they\xe2\x80\x99re in sporadic communities. \xc2\xa0But he does believe it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to draw any sweeping conclusions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, the Department of Justice does take very seriously any increase in violent crime, and it\xe2\x80\x99s -- but we also believe -- and I think the President spoke to this -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to put any sort of single reports in this historic context.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will the President touch on ISIS in his speech at the convention?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have details to read out to you in advance of the speech. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d just urge you to tune in tomorrow night.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what categorizes something for -- or what is the bar for flags to be flown at half-staff? \xc2\xa0Will any of these recent events or tragedies qualify for that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, and as you know, when the President directs the flags to be flown at half-staff, we issue a proclamation. \xc2\xa0Those proclamations are released publicly and then the flags come down, and you all usually cover that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any proclamations to forecast for you at this time, but if there\xe2\x80\x99s any decisions made on those, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure we get them to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tFred, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Democratic platform, it calls for getting rid of the -- for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment. \xc2\xa0The President actually -- pressing the ACA, signed an executive order applying the Hyde Amendment to the ACA. \xc2\xa0Also the President -- Josh, I think a few times, used the Hyde Amendment as one of the reasons that there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to defund Planned Parenthood. \xc2\xa0Is that something the President supports, the repeal of the Hyde Amendment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Fred, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we have changed our position on the Hyde Amendment. \xc2\xa0But if we do, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first to know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily on board on that particular issue --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Like you said, we have a longstanding view on this and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any changes in our position to announce today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And another hack that came up in a congressional (inaudible) few weeks ago, the House Science Committee pointed out that the FDIC had been hacked by China, and that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- the FDIC did not report it, and it looked like there might have been an attempt to avoid some oversight there. \xc2\xa0Has the administration looked into this? \xc2\xa0Is this something that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of concern about as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I have not seen that report so I can\xe2\x80\x99t comment on it, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the particular episode that you\xe2\x80\x99re referencing. \xc2\xa0I can say, in general terms, that we believe transparency is the best policy when it comes to cyber intrusions, so a lot of what we tried to do in today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement was to clarify who do you call. \xc2\xa0And we laid out the right agencies that are in the lead for each of the aspects that come into play when an intrusion takes place like this, but we absolutely believe that public reporting of these incidents is only in the -- only advances the U.S. national security interest.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the last question -- with regards to the DNC emails -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll just take a -- sort of a blunt approach on this --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s reason to believe that Vladimir Putin does want to see Donald Trump elected President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask Moscow. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll get right back to you. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- said nice things about each other, so I wanted to see if you might have -- want to weigh in.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to for me to publicly speculate on motives of United States politicians. \xc2\xa0The last thing I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do is speculate on Vladimir Putin\xe2\x80\x99s motivations. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There is talk that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money from Russia and the nation state in Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s businesses, and that is possibly a motivation. \xc2\xa0Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that make him very vulnerable as a presidential nominee, more vulnerable than usual -- to possibly be controlled or blackmailed by a nation state?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be an assessment I can offer from here, but you might want to check with the campaigns.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:54 P.M.
