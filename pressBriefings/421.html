Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:22 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me begin with a quick statement here, and then we\'ll get started with your questions.</p>\n<p>On Friday, September 12, the President will deliver remarks at a nationwide AmeriCorps Pledge ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House to mark the 20th anniversary of the national service program.\xc2\xa0 This event will kick off a year of service for 75,000 AmeriCorps members from coast to coast, and recognize the 900,000 Americans who have served through AmeriCorps over the last two decades.</p>\n<p>Additional details on the President\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the ceremony will be released as soon as they become available.\xc2\xa0 So that will be something to look forward to here in a couple weeks.</p>\n<p>Nedra, do you want to get us started?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Now that the President has met with Secretaries Hagel and Kerry, can you give us an update on the timeline for his thinking on Syria?\xc2\xa0 Is there a decision imminent?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Nedra, I\'m not in a position to read out those meetings.\xc2\xa0 The President does on a regular basis meet with his Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State when they\xe2\x80\x99re in town.\xc2\xa0 He does that weekly.\xc2\xa0 But there are obviously a couple of things that they are discussing.\xc2\xa0 The President and his team are closely watching the situation in Iraq and monitoring the ongoing military activities -- U.S. military activities against ISIL in Iraq to protect American citizens and interests in that country.</p>\n<p>We\'re also carefully watching the efforts of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to form an inclusive government.\xc2\xa0 It\'s important for the Iraqi people and for Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to unite that country to face down the threat that\'s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We have said all along that that is a key component of the comprehensive strategy that the President is going to put in place, and has put in place, to deal with this situation.</p>\n<p>There is not -- while this obviously is something that drives news coverage and captures the attention of the public, military action alone will not sufficiently confront ISIL and deal with that threat on a sustainable basis.\xc2\xa0 Certainly there\xe2\x80\x99s a very important role for the American military to play and they can make a substantial contribution to stabilizing the security situation in that country.\xc2\xa0 But for us to have a sustainable solution it\'s critically important for Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to unite the country so that they can have a united front as they confront ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That will allow them to have an integrated, sophisticated security force -- both an Iraqi security force and a Kurdish security force that can be on the ground fighting ISIL.</p>\n<p>The United States is also deeply engaged in conversations with regional governments who obviously have a very clear, vested interest in the outcome.\xc2\xa0 The United States is also in touch with our partners in Western Europe and around the globe to engage the international community in this effort.</p>\n<p>So all of that is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And the President, in the course of the conversations that he had with the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense over the last couple of days, talked about this ongoing effort.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not in a position at this point to give you with a whole lot of detail much insight into the kind of specific guidance that the President has received, or specific updates that the President has received on this situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because he does often talk about wanting an international coalition, does he want to have a decision on Syria before he goes to NATO to discuss it with other world leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would anticipate -- without previewing the meeting, I would anticipate that the threat that\'s posed by ISIL will be a topic of some conversation at that meeting.\xc2\xa0 There obviously will be leaders of some countries that have a vested interest in that outcome.\xc2\xa0 We also will have the leaders of some countries that we believe can and have already demonstrated their willingness to play a constructive role in dealing with this challenge.\xc2\xa0 But I would not, at this point, set up a time frame for a presidential decision.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President seen the video that Steven Sotloff\xe2\x80\x99s mother made appealing to ISIL?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if the President has seen that video.\xc2\xa0 It popped shortly before I came out here.\xc2\xa0 I have seen the video and I\'ve seen the news reports about the video.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the thoughts and prayers of everybody here at the White House and the Obama administration are with the Sotloff family as they endure this very tragic situation.</p>\n<p>As you know, this administration is deeply engaged and doing everything we can to seek the return of every American who is currently being held in that region.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have an update in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- whether or not the President has seen the specific video in question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if she ran that by anybody in the U.S. government, and if so, if she was discouraged or encouraged to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that the members of this administration have been in touch with the Sotloff family on a regular basis, but I don\'t have anything to share in terms of guidance that was offered to them about the wisdom of doing a video like this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it was wise for her to do this, or could this put her son in more danger?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t venture an analysis on that question.\xc2\xa0 She obviously, as is evident from the video, feels desperate about the safety and well-being of her son, and understandably so.\xc2\xa0 And that is why our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Sotloff\xe2\x80\x99s family at this very difficult and trying time.</p>\n<p>Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about engaging -- the United States government engaging regional governments and governments in Western Europe and around the globe on ISIL.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if you can give us a list of countries that that U.S. has approached to be part of the coalition.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a large number of countries that the United States has engaged.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously in regular conversation with many of our allies around the globe.\xc2\xa0 We have been in touch with them on this particular issue over the last several weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The thing that I would point out is that the Department of Defense just yesterday named seven different Western countries who are providing urgently needed arms and equipment to the Kurds.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s one example of how our allies have been enlisted in this effort.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of other countries both in the region and around the world that have made pledges of humanitarian support.\xc2\xa0 There obviously is a very dire humanitarian situation in Iraq, a large number of displaced persons within that country.\xc2\xa0 There are some religious and ethnic minorities in that country that are still at very grave risk from the violent extremists in ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So there are a lot of ways in which countries around the world and countries in the region can contribute to solving this problem.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the other important role that I should point out here is there is an opportunity for some of the regional governments that do have some influence over the Sunni tribes in western Iraq that can be enlisted and engaged in the effort to beat back the threat that\'s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are interested in those governments in the region using their influence with Sunni tribal leaders in western Iraq to engage them in this effort.</p>\n<p>There also is an opportunity for regional governments, as many of them have already, to step up and lend some support to moderate members of the Syrian opposition who are fighting ISIL forces in Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are a large number of ways that countries around the world can contribute to this effort, and the United States, as the indispensable nation in the world, is playing a leading role in engaging countries around the world on this topic.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the United States commenced surveillance flights over Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to talk about the operational details of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 surveillance and intelligence programs.\xc2\xa0 What I think I mentioned yesterday is that there is an entire wing of the Pentagon that is responsible for developing contingency plans for the Commander-in-Chief if and when he should need them.\xc2\xa0 Those plans are based on a number of things, including the analysis of intelligence.\xc2\xa0 But aside from pointing out those facts, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to discuss or confirm reports of specific operational details related to America\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence programs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, the President met with his economic advisors this morning.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us a little bit about -- more about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President did convene a meeting in the Roosevelt Room earlier today with members of his economic team.\xc2\xa0 This included members of the Cabinet as well as senior economic advisors who work here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 They discussed a broad range of things, including some of the broader trends that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing as it relates to our economy.\xc2\xa0 They discussed, among other things, the labor participation and some of things that we can do to address the labor participation rate as well as the long-term unemployment rate.\xc2\xa0 These are a couple of the issues that are perceived by some who know a whole lot more about economics than I do that this is worthy of some attention.\xc2\xa0 And there was a discussion of some policy options for dealing with and trying to mitigate some of the negative impacts that things like long-term unemployment are having on the economy.</p>\n<p>But in terms of specific policy proposals or details, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to discuss them.</p>\n<p>Nadia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you stated that the U.S. policy is not to pay ransom for any terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain to us what\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between that and your negotiating with the Taliban to secure the release of a U.S. soldier in return for other people being accused of terrorism?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I assume you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to the case of Sergeant Bergdahl?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is that it is the policy of the United States of America that we do not pay ransom or make concessions to terrorist groups to secure the release of hostages.\xc2\xa0 That is a policy that has been put in place for a couple of reasons.\xc2\xa0 The first is it\xe2\x80\x99s well documented that many extremist terrorist organizations use the revenue stream of ransoms to finance their broader operations.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, that\xe2\x80\x99s actually the lifeblood of their organization -- is being able to collect these ransoms and to roll that money into broader operations.</p>\n<p>Secondly, routinely paying ransoms only puts other innocent American citizens at risk of being kidnapped and held for ransom. And the last thing that we\xe2\x80\x99d want to do is heighten the risk even more for innocent American citizens.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, in the case of Sergeant Bergdahl, the President of the United States is the Commander-in-Chief and he has a commitment to an unimpeachable value, which is ensuring that we do not leave men and women in uniform behind enemy lines in the hands of the enemy.\xc2\xa0 And the President engaged in an effort that is typical of the end of armed conflicts for there to be prisoner exchanges.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we saw in this case.\xc2\xa0 In this case, Sergeant Bergdahl was returned to the U.S. in exchange for a handful of detainees from Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Defense certified that steps had been taken to sufficiently mitigate the threat that was posed by the release of those detainees from Guantanamo Bay, and therefore that transaction was executed and resulted in the safe return of Sergeant Bergdahl, whose safe return we celebrate and are certainly pleased by.</p>\n<p>That said -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll just finish up with this -- our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those innocent Americans who are being held hostage by extremist groups in the Middle East right now.\xc2\xa0 And this administration is exerting significant influence and resources and time and effort to secure the release of those individuals.\xc2\xa0 We will not pay ransom for them, but the United States is engaged diplomatically to try to secure their release.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The United States and the President on at least one occasion has ordered a military mission to try to free those hostages.\xc2\xa0 The mission was well-executed.\xc2\xa0 It did not, however, result in the release or the rescue of hostages.\xc2\xa0 But it does demonstrate the commitment of this administration to use even very extreme and risky measures to try to save the lives of innocent American civilians who are being held hostage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you have 8,000 people signing a petition on the White House website demanding that doing something extra for the release of Steve Sotloff does not change the policy.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t think it\'s going to change the administration policy.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We feel the circumstances of Mr. Sotloff\xe2\x80\x99s hostage-taking are tragic, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family.\xc2\xa0 And the United States is committed to doing everything that we can to try to recover him and rescue him safely and as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 We certainly would call on those who are holding him to release him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut it is the policy of the United States, and has been for quite some time, that this government does not pay ransom for American hostages.\xc2\xa0 And not only do we not -- well, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t ask others to pay ransom to secure the release of American hostages, for the reasons that I laid out -- that it only serves to allow those terrorist organizations to finance their operations, and it only puts at greater risk the lives of other American civilians.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you talk a little bit about the recruitment campaign again, other countries?\xc2\xa0 And who is leading it within the government?\xc2\xa0 Is NSC leading?\xc2\xa0 Is the Secretary of State?\xc2\xa0 How does that work?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- \xe2\x80\x9crecruitment campaign\xe2\x80\x9d I think is your word, not a word that I did use or would use, even in this situation.\xc2\xa0 I think what I would do is I would -- let\xe2\x80\x99s take a step back -- and I know that typically those are the kinds of the words that would make you cringe, but hear me out here.\xc2\xa0 The sense of a lot of people who are perceiving this situation is that the most important powerful and effective tool in the President\xe2\x80\x99s toolbox is kinetic military action.\xc2\xa0 And there is no doubt that forceful military action can play a role in stabilizing the security situation in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But what we have learned in very vivid terms over the last decade or so is that a U.S.-led military operation is not an enduring solution to this situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>After all, more than 100,000 American troops spent nearly a decade in Iraq to try to resolve the security situation in Iraq. And it did create a very important opportunity for the Iraqi people and Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to seize a stable security situation and try to put in place an inclusive government that reflected the values and interests of everybody all across that country.</p>\n<p>Tragically and disappointingly, Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders did not do that, and they pursued a more narrow sectarian agenda that caused -- that put a lot of pressure on that country, and caused it to be so weakened that an extremist organization like ISIL could step right in and make significant territorial gains across the country.\xc2\xa0 That is prima facie evidence that American military might alone cannot solve this problem on a sustainable basis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s needed is a more comprehensive solution, and that comprehensive solution certainly includes the use of American military force, but what\xe2\x80\x99s also required is the engagement of, first and foremost, an inclusive Iraqi government that can rally the country and unite the country in the face of this existential threat that they face.\xc2\xa0 That also will have the effect of strengthening their security forces, knowing -- members of their security force can know that they\xe2\x80\x99re fighting on behalf of and in support of and in defense of a united country.\xc2\xa0 That will also improve coordination between the Kurdish security forces and Iraqi security force.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s also an important role for regional governments to play and then for governments around the world to play, in no small part because of the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by foreign fighters.</p>\n<p>So this element of outreach to countries around the globe to engage them in this effort is part and parcel of the comprehensive strategy that this President has laid out for -- had laid out initially in his West Point speech, but it was discussed on several occasions since then.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I know that there are some headlines in the paper today that would lead some to believe that the United States has begun a new diplomatic effort in pursuit of this one goal.\xc2\xa0 The fact is this element of our strategy is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve communicated on multiple occasions and will continue to be a critical part of whatever success we have in facing down the threat of ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And about my cringing here --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your patience.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But back to my question.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about how is the outreach working?\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s doing what?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this kind of outreach takes place at a variety of levels.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the State Department, as the chief diplomatic arm of the United States government, has a very important role to play as they talk to their counterparts about this challenge.\xc2\xa0 The United States Department of Defense has very important military-to-military relationships that they can leverage.\xc2\xa0 There also are important relationships in the intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. intelligence community obviously has very deep relationships with countries not just in the region but around the world where they can use some knowledge and analysis to benefit this ongoing effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are these people asking countries to sign up?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say one other thing.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen readouts from the President of the United States where he\xe2\x80\x99s calling his counterparts around the world to talk to them about this situation.\xc2\xa0 So this outreach and engagement is taking place at the highest levels, but is also taking place at levels where you\xe2\x80\x99d expect -- the Department of Defense, the State Department and the intelligence community, to name just few.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Susan Rice\xe2\x80\x99s role?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As the National Security Advisor, she obviously has an important role to play.\xc2\xa0 She has counterparts with whom she speaks regularly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s on the phone, too, then?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to detail any specific phone calls that anybody is making at this point other than the calls that the President has made that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already read out.\xc2\xa0 But she certainly is involved in this effort in the same way that many other senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s team are involved.</p>\n<p>Let me jump around just a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the story that was in the Times today about the administration pushing for an international voluntary treaty on climate change.\xc2\xa0 I know that Jen Psaki put out a statement today saying that nothing is down on paper yet, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, first, if you could just speak generally if the White House supports expanding the \xe2\x80\x9992 U.N. treaty with voluntary commitments, including the kind of name-and-shame strategy that was described in the Times report.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President has articulated a number of times just this year the need to address the threat that climate change poses both to human health and to our economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he put forward a comprehensive plan to cut carbon pollution and prepare the United States for the impacts of climate change while also leading an international effort to combat global climate change.</p>\n<p>The plan that he laid out built on some of the steps that he has already taken, including doubling fuel economy standards, significantly increasing -- more than doubling the production of wind and solar.\xc2\xa0 The President put in place, his administration put in place the first-ever limits on carbon pollution from power plants and has put forward a strategy to reduce methane emissions.\xc2\xa0 So there are a whole range of ways in which this administration has moved forward to try to address what the President has identified as a priority, reducing the impact, the causes of climate change.</p>\n<p>Now, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve also said is the President has taken these steps on his own, but we would welcome any sort of cooperation we would receive from anybody on Capitol Hill, Democrat or Republican, who would be willing to engage and work side by side with the administration to make progress on some of these goals. There\xe2\x80\x99s important legislation that could be passed in pursuit of these goals.</p>\n<p>What\xe2\x80\x99s also true is the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been shy about trying to lead on the international stage as well.\xc2\xa0 So you saw that the President play an important role in Copenhagen in 2009 in trying to broker some agreements.\xc2\xa0 In his conversations with leaders in India and China and other countries, the President talks regularly about joint steps that can be taken to reduce the causes of climate change.\xc2\xa0 There was an important agreement related to HFCs that the President announced after his meeting with President Xi of China last year on this issue.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that the President regularly raises in international forums as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So as Jen pointed out in her statement, there is no written agreement at this point, but based on what you just heard me recite about the priority the President places on dealing with climate change, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to hear that this is something that members -- or officials at the State Department are working on very closely and intensely at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Because that agreement is not written, it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet clear exactly what sort of role Congress would be required to play.\xc2\xa0 Will this be the kind of an agreement that would require congressional approval in terms of exceeding to a treaty, or is this the kind of an agreement that would be what\xe2\x80\x99s been described in the past as a political agreement in which there would be a little transparency about which organization or which countries are living up to the standards that are reaching the agreement and which aren\xe2\x80\x99the?\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll work through those details in advance of the 2015 meeting in Paris, but this is something that the administration, principally through the State Department, is very hard at work on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, but I mean I guess all of that didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite answer my question of if the administration supports --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\'s a lot.\xc2\xa0 Surely something in there must have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if the administration actually supports the tenets that were kind of mentioned in the Times article, this name-and-shame idea and the voluntary expansion of the \xe2\x80\x9992 treaty with partner countries.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 The agreement hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been written yet so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of sort of what may be included in the agreement or what we\xe2\x80\x99re pushing to include in the agreement. We\xe2\x80\x99re pushing to broker the kind of an agreement that would tangibly have an impact on reducing the causes of climate change and the causes of the kinds of pollution that have such a detrimental effect on public health in this country and in communities all around the world.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re pushing hard on this.\xc2\xa0 The President has played a leading role on this in the past and he is going to play a leading role on it this time.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of what the details are going to be in that agreement, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t even started writing the agreement yet so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to say.\xc2\xa0 I will say that as a strategy, the name-and-shame thing that you are citing is a strategy that proved to be pretty effective as it relates to the agreement that was brokered in Copenhagen in 2009, so I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that strategy.\xc2\xa0 But what strategy we\xe2\x80\x99ll eventually pursue will be dictated by the content of the agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the last thing on this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there was kind of outrage on Capitol Hill from Republicans, but also Nick Rahall --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There sort of is about everything these days, though, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a Democrat from West Virginia said that he\xe2\x80\x99d do anything he could to stop the administration from working kind of outside the confines of a Senate treaty.\xc2\xa0 He said it\xe2\x80\x99s fruitless to negotiate agreements with the world that can\xe2\x80\x99t even muster the support of the American people.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could talk a little bit -- this is a Democrat.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is a little flaw in that argument, right?\xc2\xa0 But I do think that just because Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the American people won\xe2\x80\x99t support it.\xc2\xa0 There are a whole lot of things the American people support right now that Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t and that Congress has refused to act on.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to interrupt your question, I apologize.\xc2\xa0 Keep going.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, you kind of addressed it, but obviously complaints are coming from Republicans, too, on this issue of if you work on an agreement -- obviously nothing is on paper so we\xe2\x80\x99re talking a bit hypothetically, which I know that you\xe2\x80\x99re always reluctant to do, but --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a little latitude.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re negotiating a treaty that does not require Senate approval or an agreement that does not require Senate approval, is that a tougher sell to world leaders, and is it tougher to kind of enforce and put the weight of the United States behind it if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have that Senate approval?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see, I think is the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- let me try to answer your question this way.\xc2\xa0 We would not want to enter a situation where we did try to broker an agreement that did require some sort of Senate ratification and then have that fall victim once again, as so many other priorities have, to dysfunction in Congress.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to weigh all of these priorities about how impactful they can be with the international community, whether it reduces their influence with the international community to live up to these agreements, what\xe2\x80\x99s the likelihood that Congress would sort of buck their own reputation for inaction and actually take some important steps on something as important as reducing the causes of climate change.\xc2\xa0 So I think all of these things will have to be evaluated in the context of the negotiations and in the context of the content that\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately included in the agreement.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about what has to happen in addition to military action in Iraq.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the equivalent in Syria?\xc2\xa0 In other words, what\xe2\x80\x99s the comprehensive strategy for Syria other than any potential strikes that you guys might decide to make on ISIS\xe2\x80\x99s safe haven there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the elements of that strategy would not be entirely dissimilar from the elements of the strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- an inclusive government?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I think it means supporting elements of the moderate opposition that have demonstrated a desire to lead that country in a way that reflects the diversity of interests in that country.\xc2\xa0 That, after all, is what the moderate opposition has been fighting for, for more than three years now.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the administration support elements of the moderate opposition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We would continue to engage regional governments to continue their support for the moderate opposition.\xc2\xa0 Again, this would be part and parcel of pursuing the kind of political strategy that would unite the country of Syria.\xc2\xa0 After all, right now, because of the sectarian way in which the Assad regime has both governed but also attacked their own people, it has created what is essentially a de facto safe haven for extremists like ISIL to thrive.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why, particularly in Syria, it is important that ultimately -- I recognize this is a longer-term goal, this is not something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen next week -- but ultimately that there is leadership in Syria that can unite the country of Syria to confront this threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have been supporting the moderate elements of the Syrian opposition. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to encourage regional governments to support the moderate opposition in Syria.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen significant contributions from the United States, principally, but also from other countries around the world, in support of trying to meet the humanitarian needs of displaced persons in Syria.\xc2\xa0 There is obviously a very important humanitarian need there that has existed for quite some time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So those elements of the strategy will continue as well.\xc2\xa0 The broader question and the question that is in the minds of people who are asking some questions in this room and are writing some stories in the newspaper is what role does the United States military have in that strategy, and that does continue to be an open question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no peace process.\xc2\xa0 I mean, in Iraq, there\xe2\x80\x99s an actual effort to form this inclusive government.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are things happening.\xc2\xa0 But Syria is just in a civil war.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing diplomatic going on.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there have been periodically over the years conversations between the Assad regime and the elements of the moderate opposition in Syria.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that there has not been the kind of cooperation among -- just internally within different elements of the moderate Syrian opposition that we would like to see to present a united front when they negotiate with Assad.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to downplay the challenge we have there.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re significant, particularly when it comes to trying to find the kind of political agreement that will be required to ultimately resolve that civil war in Syria.\xc2\xa0 But this is something that the President is routinely looking at. We\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times here that we\xe2\x80\x99re always reviewing our strategy for dealing with Syria, and that continues to be true today.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that moderate opposition you just referred to would be the same collection of doctors and dentists that the President once described as delusional to think that if we had armed them they would have been able to do anything in Syria?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what are you talking about?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\'m talking about the fact, Bill, that there is not a military solution to the situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And this is something we\'ve talked about for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 It\'s going to require very difficult political accommodation and negotiation to try to broker an agreement among the disparate elements of the moderate opposition, and to try to reach an agreement that would allow Assad to step aside and allow a more moderate governing coalition to take hold and to govern the nation of Syria.</p>\n<p>This is a longer-term prospect.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not trying to dissuade you from that.\xc2\xa0 But certainly the doctors and dentists that you have describe ostensibly --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President did.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- are likely to be better at forming an inclusive, sort of professional government than they are going to be dug into the trenches facing the hardened fighters that are being armed by Mr. Assad.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the unity in outreach effort that you so eloquently described a moment ago --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- does this have to be completed before there\xe2\x80\x99s any possibility of armed action against -- in Syria against ISIS?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My expectation would be that this element of engaging the international community would be something that is\xc2\xa0 -- you described it I think in your question as being \xe2\x80\x9cdone\xe2\x80\x9d -- I don\'t think we\'ll ever be in a situation where we\'re done talking with our international partners about what can be done to address the situation in Iraq and Syria as they confront the threat that\'s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that will be ongoing.</p>\n<p>I don\'t think we\'ll ever reach a point where we say, okay, we\'re done coordinating with the international community on this. We\'re going to need the sustained, committed involvement of the international community to support the efforts of an inclusive Iraqi government to use their influence with Sunni tribes that can be helpful in the situation.\xc2\xa0 This is going to require a sustained effort, and this administration is willing to lead that sustained effort to get it done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President could decide at any point on this continuum to allow bombing inside Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, sure.\xc2\xa0 And the President has said that he is -- maybe the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said this, but the President\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Advisor has said the President will not hesitate where necessary to order the use of military force to protect Americans in that region.\xc2\xa0 And that continues to be true.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell us when the decision is coming, that would be helpful.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 One quick thing.\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on Ukraine saying that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been invaded by the Russians at the port way south from where the action has been taking place?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have seen from the Russians is a continued effort to destabilize the situation in eastern Ukraine --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is specifically today.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and I\'ve seen those specific reports.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not in a position to offer our own analysis of that information on military movement.\xc2\xa0 But if true, it would be consistent with the other kinds of destabilizing military activities that Russia has pursued in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 These are the same kinds of activities that the international community has called on President Putin to end, and these are the same kinds of military activities that have earned or caused the international community to impose a pretty significant cost on the Russians and on the Russian economy as a result.</p>\n<p>What we would like to see is Russia to roll back their military from across the border, to stop providing weapons and materiel and training to the separatists, and to use their influence with the separatists to try to reach a political agreement with the Ukrainian government.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I know earlier you said that the Pentagon has an entire wing that does planning.\xc2\xa0 So we can\'t always read into that -- planning takes place all the time.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But last night on CNN, Marie Harf, your counterpart at the State Department, said the Pentagon has given the President \xe2\x80\x9ca range of planning options.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That would be a little bit different than them just planning, to actually give it to the President.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?\xc2\xa0 Does the President have planning options for bombing Syria to deal with ISIS from the Pentagon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the Pentagon has made clear -- I think this is what my colleague was referring to -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that they are prepared to offer the President contingencies.\xc2\xa0 As you point out, they\xe2\x80\x99re always doing the kind of planning that\'s required to meet the requests and needs of the Commander-in-Chief, that if he should order military action, they want to make sure that they have plans available to carry out that action.</p>\n<p>But I\'m not in a position to disclose what sort of plans or conversations the President has had with his military planners.\xc2\xa0 So I can\'t confirm those individual reports because I\'m just not going to be in a position to get into those detailed conversations.\xc2\xa0 But I think what she\xe2\x80\x99s referring to is just this idea that the Department of Defense is routinely engaged in developing contingency plans for the President and can be readying to present them to him if and when he needs them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, tomorrow the U.N. Security Council is meeting to discuss a commission report they put together about the broader humanitarian crisis.\xc2\xa0 But in there -- which is obviously very serious, beyond just ISIS -- but in there, the report claims that ISIS and other armed groups have been carrying out chemical attacks.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, since that was a red line for the President previously, in a different context, with President Assad using chemical weapons, if the U.N. is correct that ISIS is using chemical weapons in Syria or elsewhere, that\'s a war crime. Does that constitute U.S. military action?\xc2\xa0 Is that a red line?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I\'m not aware that the United States has assessed that ISIL actually has used chemical weapons, so we\'ll have to check on that for you.\xc2\xa0 The United States is very interested in working through the U.N. to address so many of the challenges that we\'re faced with in Syria.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed before, both Russia and China have played a pretty negative role in the effort to mobilize the international community on this.</p>\n<p>But there is one important thing that the U.N. Security Council can do, and they will do this next month -- the President is going to convene a U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss the threat that\'s posed by foreign fighters, and that will be an important opportunity for the President to discuss with the leaders of the world what can be done cooperatively to try to counter the threat that those individuals with Western passports might pose to Western governments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that point, I haven\'t heard you -- you haven\'t been asked yet about Douglas McArthur McCain, the American killed in Syria over the weekend, allegedly fighting on behalf of ISIS.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to an American citizen going over there -- amid all the turmoil and all the crisis and the President saying what a grave threat this is -- that an American citizen is -- and others apparently -- fighting on behalf of ISIS?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\'t spoken to the President about it.\xc2\xa0 And we are in a position to confirm the death of one U.S. citizen, Douglas McArthur McCain, in Syria who was fighting on behalf of ISIL, who was affiliated with them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are thousands of foreign fighters from more than 50 countries -- or up to 50 countries who have traveled to Syria to take up arms alongside ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We are very concerned about the risk that those individuals pose to the 50 countries from which they traveled.\xc2\xa0 In many cases, these are individuals that have Western passports.\xc2\xa0 They have some freedom of movement in our modern transportation system.\xc2\xa0 And we are working cooperatively with Interpol and other law enforcement agencies, as well as the homeland security agencies in countries throughout the West and in the region to try to monitor the movements of these individuals and to mitigate the threat that they may pose.</p>\n<p>These are individuals who have been radicalized.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who\xe2\x80\x99ve received some military training.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, they\xe2\x80\x99re battle tested, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve demonstrated, as Mr. McCain did, a willingness to die for their cause.\xc2\xa0 This means that we are -- this is one of the reasons why -- this is something we\'re concerned about and have been working not just over the last several weeks but something we\'ve been working on for months.\xc2\xa0 I know this is something that Attorney General Holder has spoken about quite a bit in his conversations with his counterparts principally in Western Europe.</p>\n<p>I mentioned earlier that the President\xe2\x80\x99s chief counterterrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco, has been very focused on this, and she\xe2\x80\x99s traveled both in the region but also throughout Europe to discuss efforts to coordinate our efforts to protect the West from these individuals.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 In the speech yesterday, the President talked about James Foley, the beheading, and said that he vowed justice will be done.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if you could be more specific.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a broad statement to say that justice will be done.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just military action, that it would have to be a range of things.\xc2\xa0 And Senator McCain today was critical and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no strategy.\xc2\xa0 They flail from one issue to another, reacting rather than acting.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What is the strategy then?\xc2\xa0 For the President to say, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to root out the cancer, that\xe2\x80\x99s more of a slogan than a strategy, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xc2\xa0 What does that mean, \xe2\x80\x9croot out the cancer\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 How?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned in answer to Roger\xe2\x80\x99s question, the President has laid out a comprehensive strategy for dealing with the threat posed by ISIL. This includes elements of American military might.\xc2\xa0 It also includes using our diplomatic influence to engage regional governments in countries around the world in terms of fighting ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need an inclusive Iraqi government that\xe2\x80\x99s stable, that can unite the country to meet the existential threat that exists inside their country right now.</p>\n<p>I do want to make one note about the Republican criticism that you cited.\xc2\xa0 It stands in stark contrast to criticism that\xe2\x80\x99s been leveled by other Republicans.\xc2\xa0 I want to note that Congressman Peter King -- he\xe2\x80\x99s a member of the Homeland Security Committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence -- and he criticized President Obama, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t understand why a Commander-in-Chief would ever tell the enemy what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do or not do.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Congressman Mac Thornberry is the vice chair of Armed Services Committee and a member of the Intelligence Committee in the House.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a Republican; he\xe2\x80\x99s criticized the President by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThe first thing we should do is quit talking about what we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do.\xc2\xa0 When the President takes options off the table that only simplifies the planning of ISIS.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>I read you these two quotes to illustrate that there appears to be some disagreement among members of the Republican Party who are looking to capitalize politically on this situation.\xc2\xa0 Some Republicans want to say that the President is not doing enough to describe what he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking, and there are some Republicans who say the President has described too much of what he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re not focused on the politics.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on putting in place a strategy that can successfully defend the interests of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To jump off of that, is the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy to defeat ISIL -- defeat ISIS?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, first and foremost, Jim, the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy is to protect Americans who are in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0 There are Americans in Iraq right now whose safety is threatened by the recent advance of ISIL across western and northern Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President ordered military strikes, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has been so deeply engaged, and the Vice President and others deeply engaged in encouraging the Iraqi government to unite that country in the face of that threat.</p>\n<p>But principally, the President is focused on protecting the national security of the United States of America, and in this case protecting American personnel that are in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a different question, though.\xc2\xa0 Does he want to defeat --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you asked me what our goals were, and that is the goal.\xc2\xa0 And that is the goal the President has in mind.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you have cancer, typically you want to defeat cancer.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to die from cancer, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll agree to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If ISIS is a cancer, does he want to defeat it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, of course, Jim.\xc2\xa0 But the goal of this action and what the President is focused on as we pursue this strategy that includes elements of American military might, that includes diplomacy with governments in the region and around the world, that includes our intensive conversations with Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to unite that country -- our focal point here is safeguarding the American people and putting the foreign policy interests of the United States first and foremost.\xc2\xa0 In this case, that means ensuring the safety and security of American personnel who are in Iraq right now.\xc2\xa0 They have some important work to be done there, and we want to make sure that they can be safe while they do that important work.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know you had some questions earlier about a time frame for options on Syria -- ISIS in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Is there an urgency for the developing -- or for the development of those options?\xc2\xa0 Is it crunch time?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that this is a situation that the President and his team is watching very closely, and the President is getting regular updates both on our military activities there, but also in assessing the capabilities and movements of ISIL, principally because he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the safety and well-being of American citizens who are in that region.</p>\n<p>The President is also getting regular diplomatic updates about the response that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting from countries around the world as we try to enlist them in this effort.\xc2\xa0 The President is also getting regularly briefed and updated on the political situation in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 A critical component of this solution is an inclusive Iraqi government that can unite the country and that can marshal a sophisticated and integrated Iraqi security force that can be on the ground and meet the existential threat that that country faces right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there was some conversation, some discussion about the ethnic Shiite Turkmen in northern Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Iraqi forces have been evacuating them from that region because of the threat posed by ISIS.\xc2\xa0 Is there a similar humanitarian situation taking shape there that might lead the President to decide on a Mount Sinjar-type operation in that part of Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of any decisions that the President may make.\xc2\xa0 But I did refer earlier to our concern about religious and ethnic minorities in different communities in Iraq that are being persecuted and are at risk of terrible violence from ISIL right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the situation you\xe2\x80\x99re watching?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that -- that, and other situations like it is certainly something that we\xe2\x80\x99re watching.\xc2\xa0 The President has demonstrated our nation\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing humanitarian massacres or even genocides like that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to jump to domestic politics -- Republicans in recent days have talked about the prospect of a continuing resolution vote in the fall being used as leverage to block the President from taking executive action on immigration.\xc2\xa0 That, of course, raises the prospect of a government shutdown.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think a government shutdown might happen this fall?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have no idea.\xc2\xa0 It certainly was a shame when --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not in a position to say whether there will be a government shutdown?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It certainly was a shame when Republicans engaged in a strategy to shut down the government over the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And that was -- there were bad consequences for that government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 It certainly did have a negative impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0 And we would hope that Republicans wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do the same thing again, to shut down the government over a common-sense, bipartisan effort to try to mitigate at least some of the worst problems that are caused by our broken immigration system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might that make the President think twice about taking executive action on immigration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it won\xe2\x80\x99t, because the President is determined to take the kind of common-sense steps that are required to address the worst problems of our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 Nothing the President does is a replacement for the kind of robust solution that passed with bipartisan support through the United States Senate, but the President is determined to act where House Republicans won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And there is strong support for that all across the country -- from the business community, the labor community, law enforcement, even senior members of the faith community, some of whom -- many of whom, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for Democrats in recent elections but are supportive of trying to put in place policies that will address some of the worst inequities of our broken immigration system.</p>\n<p>So, again, it would be a real shame if Republicans were to engage in an effort to shut down the government over a common-sense solution like that.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99ve done it before, and hopefully they won\xe2\x80\x99t do it again.</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, this has been asked a couple different ways, so just forgive me for trying one more time.\xc2\xa0 What, if anything, is the administration doing to prevent ISIS from having a future operational safe haven across the border in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a couple of things that we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in here.\xc2\xa0 Principally, this is a challenge that cannot be answered or at least -- let me say it this way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been telling us what you can\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking what is --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to keep that lesson in mind, right?\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to repeat some of the mistakes of the past and just assume that the robust and aggressive use of our very impressive military, that that alone can solve this problem on an enduring basis.\xc2\xa0 If we actually want to sustain an enduring solution, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require other elements of American power and influence to get that done.\xc2\xa0 That means enlisting the international community, both regional governments that have a very clear, vested interest in the outcome, as well as countries around the globe.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to require elements of the moderate opposition in Syria to step up to coordinate amongst themselves to do a better job of coordinating and cooperating amongst themselves to meet the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So there is a strategy --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that coordination being done to counter the threat that Bashar al-Assad was posing and not necessarily the threat that ISIS was posing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it was both.\xc2\xa0 Even the reports of the death of the American who was fighting in Syria on behalf of ISIL, he was reportedly killed by elements of the moderate opposition as they were fighting ISIS elements in their country. So it\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that the moderate opposition is fighting not just the Assad regime but also the dangerous elements of ISIL as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you think that there will be a time in the near future when ISIS won\xe2\x80\x99t have an operational safe haven in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly would be very dangerous for them to have an enduring safe haven in Syria.\xc2\xa0 I guess I would say that that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I might point out that that\xe2\x80\x99s another lesson that we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned in terms of trying to protect American national security, that giving terrorists with violent aspirations a safe haven from which to operate for an extended period of time has very dangerous consequences for American national security as well.</p>\n<p>Olivier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, one, and then a follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Does the President consider ISIL to be a state-sponsored terrorist group?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is a question I have not contemplated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The follow-up will probably shed a little bit of light, which is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a lot about your comprehensive strategy about Iraq, about the combination of military force and diplomatic pressure and the rest of it, but what about the components of starving ISIL of financial support from states around the region?\xc2\xa0 I mean, for a long time now, American officials have complained about money flowing from individuals and possibly even states in the region to the more extremist elements.\xc2\xa0 So what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at is whether your comprehensive plan envisions piling on the pressure to those states to either stop state support or stop individual support.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me tentatively accept the premise of your question and say that we do believe that there are a range of ways that regional governments and governments around the globe can play a constructive role in trying to counter the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that I mentioned earlier was that there is probably an opportunity for some regional governments to use their influence with the Sunni tribes in western Iraq to enlist them in the effort to defeat ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That would be a way that governments could leverage their relationship with individuals to play a constructive role in this effort.</p>\n<p>If there were an opportunity for governments to play a similar role as it relates to those individuals who are financially supporting ISIL, then we certainly would welcome that contribution as well.\xc2\xa0 I will say that my understanding is that the majority of financing for ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s activities comes from their own organizational efforts, so to speak -- that ISIL is engaged in shakedowns in local communities that they run.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Money from --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And so, that that is the principal way. And ransoming hostages is something else that they do that has also bankrolled their efforts as well.\xc2\xa0 So any part of -- and David Cohen over at the Treasury Department will be the first to tell you that one important way that you can counter these kinds of threats is to shut off their access to money.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the things that makes ISIL so dangerous, is they\xe2\x80\x99ve already demonstrated that they have significant access to large sums of money, and that will make them difficult to confront.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just one more bite at this.\xc2\xa0 Since the Syrian uprising began, there has been a disagreement between the United States and some of its regional allies about how to go about funding, equipping, training or arming opposition to Bashar al-Assad.\xc2\xa0 And I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at is how much of the problem being faced today in the region from ISIL stems from that disagreement.\xc2\xa0 In other words, are you seeing nominal partners and allies who over the past couple of years have provided resources to ISIL?\xc2\xa0 How much of a problem has that been?\xc2\xa0 Has it stopped?\xc2\xa0 Are you confident that today that\xe2\x80\x99s not happening anymore?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s probably a difficult assessment to deliver from here.\xc2\xa0 I think I would observe that it is in the clear interest of the vast majority of countries in this region for a violent destabilizing entity like ISIL to fail.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we are engaged in an effort to enlist these regional governments in the effort to counter ISIL; that there is an opportunity for these regional governments to do a variety of things -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s contributing humanitarian aid, using their political influence with individual communities in this region, or even contributing to the military effort -- that there are a lot of things that those regional governments can do.\xc2\xa0 And it does seem, at least on the face of it, based on my own very simple-minded analysis, that they have a pretty clear interest in doing that.</p>\n<p>Chris, I don\'t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten to you yet, and I apologize for the delay in doing so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken often about common-sense gun laws.\xc2\xa0 And I just wonder in that context if he has seen the video or had a reaction to the 9-year-old who was at a firing range with an Uzi and killed her gun instructor, shot her gun instructor?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, I saw those news reports.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the video, and so I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to comment on the situation without knowing the details of the circumstances in which this occurred.\xc2\xa0 I know they were at a gun range, and I know this was an instructor who tragically was killed in this -- what apparently was an accident.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut it certainly doesn\'t change anything about the President\xe2\x80\x99s views that there can and should be more that Congress can do to pass legislation that would keep guns out of the hands of those individuals who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have them.\xc2\xa0 What impact that kind of legislation would have on this situation is difficult to assess without knowing the circumstances here.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly -- tragic incidents like this certainly don\'t undermine the case that the President has been making on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I can go back, a very different topic, back to Iraq and the Turkmen minority.\xc2\xa0 And can you give us a sense of is there a bar or what the President is looking at in considering where he does these humanitarian airdrops?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, generally speaking, there is significant capability that our Department of Defense has to carry out defense -- to carry out humanitarian aid drops like those we saw near the Sinjar Mountains.\xc2\xa0 So these kinds of options are on the table because they do alleviate some of the suffering that is sustained by religious and ethnic minorities that are being persecuted, or at least threatened by ISIL.</p>\n<p>In terms of this specific situation, I can\'t comment on the President\xe2\x80\x99s latest thinking in terms of what sort of American intervention, or if an American intervention is being contemplated.\xc2\xa0 But this is the kind of situation that the President has ordered military action in support of in the past. And this particular situation is one that the President and his national security team continues to watch very closely.</p>\n<p>JC, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 How concerned --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Actually, Lalit, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do JC, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Want him to go first, then I can do the last one?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned is this administration that once again the United States will bear the major burden when it comes to financial costs and the cost of human treasure as this particular situation possibly escalates?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say two things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is the President has demonstrated that he is prepared to expend significant resources to protect American personnel in that region; that we have important interests there, and we have a large number of American personnel in that region.\xc2\xa0 They were in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way as ISIL was making their advance across western and northern Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And the President did not hesitate to expend resources to protect them.\xc2\xa0 That will not change.</p>\n<p>However, we know that this effort will be more successful and the solution more enduring if we can succeed in engaging the international community to contribute.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we are hopeful that Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s government will succeed in forming an inclusive government that will unite the country against ISIL.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue our intensive diplomacy with governments in the region to enlist them in this effort, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to have the kinds of conversations with our allies around the globe that we have on a range of issues to talk about what they can do to address this situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd whether it\xe2\x80\x99s providing humanitarian aid, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s offering additional training assistance or equipment to Iraqi and Kurdish security forces -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s political leverage that they have with individual communities or tribal leaders, for example, inside of Iraq to enlist the efforts of those tribes or individuals in this effort, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll ask those governments to use them as well.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there are wide range of ways in which members of the international community and regional governments can participate in this effort.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to try to enlist them in it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would this possibly include meetings next week in Wales?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I think I mentioned earlier, this is certainly a topic that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will come up for some discussion, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t preview what those discussions are at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Lalit, last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to check with you if the President got a chance to speak to Secretary Kerry and Secretary Hagel this week on their recent trip to India.\xc2\xa0 How was it?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the feedback he received from them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Lalit, as you know, the President after the election of Prime Minister Modi invited him to Washington.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still working on locking down a date.\xc2\xa0 The President does look forward to meeting with the Prime Minister at a mutually convenient time.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, both Secretary Kerry and Secretary Hagel have traveled to India to meet with their counterparts.\xc2\xa0 I believe that at least one of them met with Prime Minister Modi, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both of them.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Both of them did -- to discuss the very broad relationship between the United States and India.\xc2\xa0 Items on the agenda included national security and counterterrorism cooperation for sure.\xc2\xa0 There were also discussions about the economic ties and trade relationship that exists between India and the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs I mentioned to somebody earlier, when talking about climate change, that this is an issue that is constantly on the agenda when there are discussions between high-level members of the U.S. government and high-level members of the Indian government.\xc2\xa0 So there is a rich, robust relationship between the United States and India.\xc2\xa0 That was on display when the President hosted Prime Minister Modi\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor for a state dinner here at the White House early in the first term of this administration.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to building on that relationship when he meets with Prime Minister Modi at a time -- sometime soon.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good one.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:27 P.M.
