Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:12 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I actually have a little announcement at the top to review with you. \xc2\xa0I wanted to talk to you a little bit more this afternoon about the President\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming bus tour through New York and Pennsylvania where he is going to talk about his vision for ensuring a better bargain for the middle class.</p>\n<p>He\xe2\x80\x99s given some speeches already to talk about creating jobs, about improving the housing market. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk a little bit this week about college affordability. \xc2\xa0As I mentioned yesterday never before has getting a college education been more important to ensuring that middle-class families have access to economic opportunity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are some pretty compelling statistics that you can see behind me about what a problem this is. \xc2\xa0Average tuition at a public, four-year college has more than tripled -- tripled -- over the last three decades, while family incomes have barely increased. \xc2\xa0The average student today graduates with more than $26,000 in student debt.</p>\n<p>Now what we do know is that Americans who are able to get a college education, those who graduate from college, have the power and capacity to earn more, and they have a lower unemployment rate. \xc2\xa0So the kind of investment that you make in a college education pays off in real economic terms.</p>\n<p>Now, there was also a study that was published today that shows that the federal government is doing more than ever to open up the door to a college education to middle-class families, that the federal government is providing more assistance than ever before. \xc2\xa0But government assistance can\'t keep up with skyrocketing costs. \xc2\xa0So what the President believes that we need to do is we need to fundamentally rethink and reshape the college -- the higher education system, and we need to find a way to build on innovation.</p>\n<p>So the President on this bus tour will lay out some fundamental reforms that would bring real change to the way that we pay for college education in this country. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, the proposals that the President is going to lay out are not going to be popular with everybody, but they are going to be in the best interest of middle-class families. \xc2\xa0And the President is looking forward to having that discussion over the course of Thursday and Friday in addition riding on a bus.</p>\n<p>So with that --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So can you tell us what the reforms are?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wait to Thursday. \xc2\xa0I don\'t want to give away the secret now. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Please. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, are you going to have a backgrounder sometime before Thursday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility we may do that. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you give a sense if they are things Congress will have to do, or if they\'re executive decisions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on that this week. \xc2\xa0Stay tuned. \xc2\xa0All right.</p>\n<p>Julie, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the first one.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Turning to Egypt.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Senator Leahy\xe2\x80\x99s office told the AP earlier today that the administration informed the subcommittee on foreign operations that the U.S. has stopped military aid to Egypt. \xc2\xa0The Daily Beast had a similar report. \xc2\xa0Is this what the administration has told lawmakers?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Julie, what I said to you yesterday and what I -- let me start over, what I said yesterday is true today, which is that in early July, the President of the United States directed his national security team to conduct a review of the assistance and aid that we provide to Egypt. \xc2\xa0This is part of the complex and broad relationship that we have the Egyptians -- with the Egyptians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That review that the President ordered in early July has not concluded, and reports to the contrary that -- published reports to the contrary that suggest that assistance to Egypt has been cut off are not accurate.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But while you\xe2\x80\x99re conducting this review, has the aid that\xe2\x80\x99s in the pipeline stopped?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s back up and do two things here. \xc2\xa0The first is there are some things that we have announced that affect the aid and assistance relationship that we have with Egypt. \xc2\xa0For example, the administration about a month ago announced that the scheduled delivery of F-16s had been delayed. \xc2\xa0The President announced in a statement last week that the joint military operation known as Bright Star had been canceled. \xc2\xa0So there have been some steps that this administration has taken.</p>\n<p>But it\xe2\x80\x99s important for you and your readers to understand that providing foreign assistance is not like a spigot. \xc2\xa0You don\'t turn it off and on, or turn it up or down like a faucet. \xc2\xa0Assistance is provided episodically, that it\xe2\x80\x99s provided in specific tranches.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, I get that. \xc2\xa0I get that. \xc2\xa0But --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And so those tranches are under an ongoing review.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But while you\xe2\x80\x99re undergoing this review, we do know that there is about a half a billion dollars in military aid that\'s scheduled to go to the Egyptians by September 30th that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone to them yet. \xc2\xa0Is the policy of the administration that while the aid is under review, you\'re going to be holding that back, stopping it and waiting until this review finishes before deciding to send it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There is an ongoing review of our aid and assistance relationship with Egypt. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you\'re not saying what Senator Leahy is saying is wrong? \xc2\xa0He is saying that the aid has stopped. \xc2\xa0And he also said -- one of his aides told us that this is current practice. \xc2\xa0This is not necessarily official policy. \xc2\xa0I\'m just trying to understand, is what Senator Leahy said correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I haven\'t seen the entirety of Senator Leahy\'s remarks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\'s what I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting here and telling you, that he said that U.S. military aid to Egypt has stopped. \xc2\xa0It\'s current practice, not necessarily official policy. \xc2\xa0And there is no indication of how long it will last. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The aid -- our aid and assistance relationship with Egypt is under a review, but it has not been cut off. \xc2\xa0A decision to cut off aid --</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0A decision to cut off aid would be announced, if it were to be announced, after that review had been completed. \xc2\xa0And that review is being --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But he\'s not saying it\'s been cut off. \xc2\xa0He\'s just saying that it\'s currently stopped. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0Well, I think if I were trying to make the same case people are making here, you would be suggesting that I was engaged in a game of semantics here. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to be --</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It feels like we are kind of engaged in a game of semantics though.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And I\'m trying to be as candid as possible with you about what exactly our policy has been. \xc2\xa0We have been pretty forthcoming about what our policy is here. \xc2\xa0We announced publicly the delay in the F-16s. \xc2\xa0We -- the President himself announced publicly the cancelation of the joint military exercises. \xc2\xa0The President himself publicly directed his administration to conduct a broader review of our aid and assistance to Egypt. \xc2\xa0And that aid and assistance is ongoing, and no determination or conclusion of that review has been reached at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the aid and assistance is ongoing. \xc2\xa0It\'s being sent. \xc2\xa0It has not stopped.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like -- this is not a faucet in which you just turn the spigot and assistance continues to flow. \xc2\xa0Assistance is provided episodically. \xc2\xa0Assistance is provided in tranches. \xc2\xa0And that is the way that this works. \xc2\xa0So this is not a matter of turning the dial one way or the other. \xc2\xa0This is a matter of taking a close and careful look at the assistance that the United States provides to our partners in Egypt.</p>\n<p>And that evaluation is based on a few things. \xc2\xa0It\'s based on ensuring that we\'re in compliance with the law. \xc2\xa0It\'s based on an analysis of the national security interests of the United States of America. \xc2\xa0That\'s the focal point of every foreign policy decision that the President makes. \xc2\xa0It\'s certainly an important part of his calculation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But it\'s also affected by the actions taken by the interim Egyptian government. \xc2\xa0This interim Egyptian government has made promises to transition back to a democratically elected civilian government. \xc2\xa0The violence that they perpetrated last week, and has continued at least into the weekend and the early parts of this week, are contrary to that promise. \xc2\xa0And that factors into our review of this aid and assistance relationship. \xc2\xa0But to suggest that a decision has been made about that aid and assistance is just not accurate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, that\'s not what Leahy is suggesting. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Maybe it\'s not. \xc2\xa0I haven\'t seen the statements. \xc2\xa0But if you\'re asking me what our policy is, I think I\'ve just tried to explain it to you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just quickly then, speaking of the Egyptian military and their actions, they\'ve detained the Supreme Leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. \xc2\xa0Is there any U.S. reaction to that development?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\'ve spoken out a couple of times pretty forcefully and directly about politically motivated detentions. \xc2\xa0That is not in line with the standard that we expect other governments to uphold in terms of respecting human rights. \xc2\xa0It\'s certainly not the standard that the Egyptian people expect of their government in terms of upholding basic human rights. \xc2\xa0So this is just the latest in a series of actions the Egyptian government has taken that doesn\'t reflect their commitment to an inclusive political process, to a respect for basic human rights like the right to protest peacefully. \xc2\xa0And it certainly is an act that\'s contrary to a legal system that\'s insulated from politics.</p>\n<p>Thank you, Julie. \xc2\xa0Roberta.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In Mali, a place where the United States was able to make the determination to turn off the spigot of aid, the President made a statement today about the elections and the outcome. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0He did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering I guess how close the United States is to resuming aid there, to making the decisions/determinations to go forward, to resume aid?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know this is something that\'s currently being evaluated by the State Department, and I think at the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0So in terms of the logistics that are required there, I\'d encourage you to check with them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the White House has no comment on whether the President or the White House would like to see aid resume?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Just that this is something that\'s being reviewed by the State Department and the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0So if you have questions about the details, I\'d encourage you to check with them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the other question I have is, as you know, this fall the President faces the challenge of finding a way to work with Congress to keep the government running and make sure the United States can continue to repay its debt. \xc2\xa0So I\'m just curious about why he\xe2\x80\x99s using his time leading up to that debate to focus on issues like higher education and jobs and infrastructure, rather than using it to find a way to move forward on those immediate fiscal issues, those immediate economic issues.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0When I say that I genuinely appreciate the question, I genuinely do appreciate this question, because I do think that it will provide some insight into you about how the President -- provide some insight for you about the President considers these broader issues that will be the subject of some debate in the fall about how are we going to make sure that Congress takes the kinds of steps they should take and put in place the kinds of policies they should put in place to support our economic recovery that\'s gaining traction.</p>\n<p>Too often we see Congress put in place policies that actually undermine that economic recovery. \xc2\xa0And threatening a government shutdown or threatening to default on the full faith and credit of the United States of America would undermine the economic recovery that\'s starting to gain some traction. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The way that the President considers these policy questions is through the prism of what\'s in the best interests of middle-class families all across the country. \xc2\xa0And he believes that we need to offer up a better bargain for middle-class families. \xc2\xa0And that means expanding economic opportunity for middle-class families, by looking for policies that will create jobs -- but also making sure that we put in place policies that will open up the doors to a high-quality college education for more middle-class families. \xc2\xa0That should be a domestic priority. \xc2\xa0That is a domestic priority of the President\'s.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And our ability to make progress on expanding economic opportunity for the middle class is the President\'s top domestic priority. \xc2\xa0And so when we\'re dealing with these larger budget and economic issues that are related to the fiscal year 2014 budget and the debt ceiling, the President is going to evaluate agreements that we can reach with Congress on those things by what impact they have on the middle class. \xc2\xa0So I think it is entirely appropriate that in the lead-up to those debates that the President make clear to the American public, and make the case to the American public, about why the priorities that he has identified for the middle-class are also going to be the priorities that he uses to evaluate policy decisions that are contemplated by Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jessica.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, in an effort to clarify the state of U.S. assistance to Egypt, would you --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s why I\'m here. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Great. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Would you dispute the following statement: \xc2\xa0Aid is not currently flowing to Egypt, so there is no aid to turn off?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I would dispute that statement. \xc2\xa0It\'s my understanding -- I\'m not steeped in all the details here, but it is my understanding that there are --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Military aid.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0-- that there are tranches of assistance that have gone to Egypt. \xc2\xa0So again this is not part of -- there are also some that have been stopped. \xc2\xa0The biggest ones have been stopped. \xc2\xa0This is the delay in the delivery of the F-16s and the cancelation of the joint military exercise known as Bright Star. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the Department of Defense talked about this a little bit today that there have been some --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Military aid. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0-- in comparison relatively small packages of assistance that have gone to Egypt.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Military aid?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You\'d have to talk to the Department of Defense about the nature of that assistance. \xc2\xa0But we\'re talking about assistance to Egypt and whether or not it stopped. \xc2\xa0And while you\'re right it\'s not like a faucet -- you can\'t just twist the dial off and on, or turn it up or down, or hotter or warmer or colder -- but it is evaluated in tranches. \xc2\xa0And while that broader package of assistance is under review, there are some smaller packages that have moved forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And would you dispute the assertion that aid has been reprogrammed while this review is underway so that it\'s in a position to be turned off officially if the -- if administration officials decide that\'s where the U.S. should be?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not sure I understand every word of your question, but let me take a couple of pieces of this. \xc2\xa0It\'s my understanding that the use of the word "reprogram" is not accurate. \xc2\xa0I know that\'s been some of the reporting, but I don\'t think that\'s accurate.</p>\n<p>I think there are others who have suggested that one of the things the administration is doing is trying to preserve some flexibility, so that the outcome of that review can present the President with a range of options. \xc2\xa0I think that would probably be maybe a more accurate way of describing this than what you have posed in your question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it would be accurate to say that the U.S., as we speak, continues to flow military aid to Egypt?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again you use the word "flow," and I\'ve said that several times now that that\'s not appropriate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, the U.S. continues to provide military aid to Egypt as we speak?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that\'s the same thing of saying that we haven\'t cut off -- it\'s inaccurate to suggest that we\'ve cut off aid to Egypt. \xc2\xa0We can go around and around on this. \xc2\xa0I\'m trying to be as clear and candid as I can.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But there\'s a reason you\'re not confirming that we are currently providing military aid to Egypt.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, because it\'s not like the faucet is turned on. \xc2\xa0Right?</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But we understand that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\'s not. \xc2\xa0The faucet is not turned on, because it\'s not a faucet. \xc2\xa0What we are doing on a regular basis is we are considering individual tranches of assistance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I just asked if it\'s currently going there, if there\'s currently aid being provided and you said yes. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, no, no. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And now you\xe2\x80\x99re clarifying.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what I said -- well, we can go to the transcript a little later. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to suggest to you is that there is a broader review that\'s underway of our assistance and aid relationship with Egypt. \xc2\xa0And that aid and assistance is not a faucet that\'s turned on or turned off. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What it is, is a package of tranches, a series of tranches. \xc2\xa0And each of those things -- each of those things is evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on the criteria that I laid out -- for our national interest, our compliance with the law, and the actions of the Egyptian government. \xc2\xa0So this is a review that is ongoing, and it is done on a case-by-case basis as we need to evaluate each of these tranches. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to say whether or not --</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But bottom line, you\xe2\x80\x99re not disputing that aid is -- you\xe2\x80\x99re not stating that aid is currently going to Egypt. \xc2\xa0You won\xe2\x80\x99t -- you will not affirmatively state that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What -- the reason -- the reason I will -- the reason I think that is the wrong way to describe our position is because it\xe2\x80\x99s not a situation, it\xe2\x80\x99s a not a question of whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s happening right now, right? \xc2\xa0The question is --</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not happening now? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, maybe that\'s the question for Wolf Blitzer. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not the question for me. \xc2\xa0The question for me is: \xc2\xa0Is the United States reviewing our aid to Egypt? \xc2\xa0We are. \xc2\xa0Is that assistance -- does that mean that you are no longer going to provide assistance to the Egyptians? \xc2\xa0It does not mean that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Officially.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Officially? \xc2\xa0What do you mean? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t understand your question.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re saying that there will be an ultimate determination made.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There will.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re asking what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the interim period.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s a legitimate question. \xc2\xa0The fact that we are in an interim period should make -- that you\xe2\x80\x99re acknowledging that we\xe2\x80\x99re in an interim period should make you skeptical of reports that we\xe2\x80\x99ve cut off aid to Egypt. \xc2\xa0That\'s what the reports indicate right now, and I would encourage you to be skeptical about it.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But that\'s a straw man, Josh. \xc2\xa0Nobody --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Nobody has asked you --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s exactly what the reports say. \xc2\xa0They say that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been cut off to Egypt. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, okay, but nobody in this --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And that\'s not -- and that\'s not an accurate representation of our -- the posture is.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Understood. \xc2\xa0But nobody in this room has posed the question that way. \xc2\xa0I think the question that most people are trying to ask is: \xc2\xa0Have there been instances in this interim period, during the period of review, have there been instances and will there be instances in which tranches of aid that would have gone out without a review are now not going to go out or being held back or delayed --</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Paused.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- or put on pause or whatever phrase you want to put so that it doesn\'t rob the President of whatever flexibility he may want? \xc2\xa0I mean is that kind of thing happening?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me see if I can take a run at saying this more precisely.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sorry, guys. \xc2\xa0I didn\'t mean to jump in.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, no, please.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s all right. \xc2\xa0I think you\xe2\x80\x99re being a helpful contributor to the conversation here. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0So we welcome it.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- speaking in tranches again. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Turn the spigot on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The comment box will be available after the briefing. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0You can deposit them there.</p>\n<p>What I would say to you is this, as I mentioned in the answer to Jessica\xe2\x80\x99s question, whether tranches of aid have gone out since the announcement of this review, the Department of Defense announced earlier today that the answer to that question is yes. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know the nature of that assistance. \xc2\xa0You should ask them about that.</p>\n<p>So if you want to know what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in this interim period while there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing review, at least some assistance has gone out. \xc2\xa0The other thing I can confirm for you is that because we have not made a decision to cut off aid to Egypt, it is possible that additional tranches of aid could go out. \xc2\xa0But that\'s something that\'s being evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>And again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re switching it on and switching it off because again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like a faucet. \xc2\xa0But it is an ongoing review of specific tranches of aid. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s where we -- that\'s where we stand.</p>\n<p>Is that clarifying? \xc2\xa0At least a little.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But can you answer -- Josh, can you answer Senator Leahy though -- to try it this way. \xc2\xa0Senator Leahy\xe2\x80\x99s aid says, \xe2\x80\x9cthe transfer of military aid was stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0True?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that that\'s not true.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\'s not true.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That we\xe2\x80\x99ve not --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So Senator Leahy is wrong?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s under -- it\xe2\x80\x99s under our review. \xc2\xa0Well, again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen his whole statement, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make a declaration like that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you is that our aid is -- continues to be under review and to suggest that that aid has been cut off is inaccurate because that review has not concluded.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And why -- why won\xe2\x80\x99t the administration say that it was a coup? \xc2\xa0Since there was a democratically elected person, he was running it, people were not happy with what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing, but he had been elected. \xc2\xa0The military came in. \xc2\xa0It knocked him out of office and put him in prison. \xc2\xa0Why is that not a coup?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What we have said, Ed, is that we -- it is the view of this administration that a determination about a coup, about whether it occurred or not, is not a determination that is in the best interests of the United States; that what we are going to do is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to set aside this decision about whether or not a coup occurred and evaluate our ongoing relationship with Egypt in a way that maximizes the national security interests of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And since this is an administration that prides itself on transparency, why not be --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m being transparent with you, Ed.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You are now perhaps. \xc2\xa0But --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And I have been for a week. \xc2\xa0I answered this question six days ago.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that you have not.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But why won\xe2\x80\x99t the administration writ large be transparent with the American people and the world when the entire world can see, the military came in, took out a democratically elected President. \xc2\xa0So --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying to you is available to anybody who seeks answers to this question which is that we have made the determination that making a decision about whether or not a coup occurred is not in the best interests of the United States. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very candid about that. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been candid about our posture related to aid and assistance. \xc2\xa0We delayed the delivery of F-16s. \xc2\xa0That is a decision that was announced publicly. \xc2\xa0We canceled a joint military exercise known as Bright Star. \xc2\xa0That is an announcement that the President himself made in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard last week. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At the beginning of July, the President announced publicly that our review and that our aid and assistance relationship with Egypt was under review. \xc2\xa0We have made these announcements and these decisions public. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve explained to them -- explained to you and to your viewers why these decisions were made and why these actions were taken.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple of other quick ones. \xc2\xa0What do you say to our allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia that are saying that they\'re backing the military government, and that the U.S. should be backing the military government in Egypt because they\'re going to bring stability? \xc2\xa0Not today but in the long run, they\'re bringing stability. \xc2\xa0What do you say to our allies?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I would say to anybody who asks is that we have expressed our strong concerns -- in fact, our condemnation -- about the failure of the interim government in Egypt, the one that you were referring to, to respect basic human rights. \xc2\xa0In fact, they went beyond just disrespecting those rights and actually perpetrating terrible violence against many peaceful protestors. \xc2\xa0That is something that this administration is -- and the President himself is deeply concerned by.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are a range of reasons why we\'re deeply concerned about that. \xc2\xa0One of them is this is a government that took power promising a prompt transition back to a democratically elected civilian government through an inclusive political process. \xc2\xa0The killing of peaceful protestors is not in line with a promise to transition back to a democratically elected civilian government. \xc2\xa0So our concerns are that this interim government is not living up to the promises that they made just six or eight weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A last one on the NSA -- The Guardian newspaper, following on everything that was discussed yesterday -- The Guardian is saying that British authorities destroyed several hard drives, because they wanted to keep secrets that Edward Snowden had leaked from actually getting out. \xc2\xa0They were stored in The Guardian\'s -- they had some hard drives there at their offices. \xc2\xa0British authorities went in there and destroyed these hard drives. \xc2\xa0Did the American government get a heads up about that the way you did about the person being detained?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'ve seen the published reports of those accusations, but I don\'t have any information for you on that.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And does the U.S. government think it\'s appropriate for a government, especially one of our allies, to go in and destroy hard drives? \xc2\xa0Is that something this administration would do?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The only thing I know about this are the public reports about this, so it\'s hard for me to evaluate the propriety of what they did based on incomplete knowledge of what happened. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But this administration would not do that, would not go into an American media company and destroy hard drives, even if it meant trying to protect national security, you don\'t think?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\'s very difficult to imagine a scenario in which that would be appropriate. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Major. \xc2\xa0I am going to get back to the back row there, so stay on your toes back there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We\'re nearing the end of a fiscal year. \xc2\xa0Is the administration also reviewing, because this is a longstanding relationship with Egypt --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- which has a dollar amount that\'s been relatively stable for many, many years -- about $1.5 billion. \xc2\xa0As it puts together and looks toward any foreign operations appropriations bill for the next fiscal year, do you want less money to go to Egypt? \xc2\xa0And is that something that\'s also under review, not just what\'s in existing law, but what may come to the President for his signature in the next three to four months?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I can tell you that part of this review involves careful and close consultation with leaders in Congress. \xc2\xa0We\'ve heard a variety of opinions expressed by members of Congress about how best to manage the ongoing situation in Egypt. \xc2\xa0And we certainly -- some of those opinions have been communicated pretty forcefully. \xc2\xa0But certainly it\'s appropriate for them to do so given the role that Congress has to play here. \xc2\xa0So part of this review -- \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Isn\'t that the bigger question really going forward, because there\'s a lot more money in the out-months as opposed to what little remains in this fiscal year?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, our ongoing aid and assistance relationship with Egypt is absolutely a question. \xc2\xa0And it\'s something that is under careful review. \xc2\xa0And that review, as you rightly point out, it includes consultation with leaders in Congress. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On future assistance?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0Well, also on future assistance. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President can also exert some influence on International Monetary Fund lending. \xc2\xa0And the general question of financial investment in Egypt, on those points what is the President\'s current posture? \xc2\xa0Is this a good investment climate? \xc2\xa0Is this a place that ought to receive IMF loans -- which the United States is a significant player? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the United States is the largest donor to the IMF. \xc2\xa0And I believe that we actually exercise some veto authority over some decisions that are made at the IMF, because of that status. \xc2\xa0I know that -- you\'d have to talk to the IMF about their evaluation of the political climate there and what impact that would have on assistance they may provide to Egypt. \xc2\xa0But even a novice like me I think would observe that what\'s happening there right now is probably not good for that evaluation that\'s ongoing. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the same would be true of foreign investment. \xc2\xa0That is a critical part of the strength of the Egypt economy. \xc2\xa0And they depend on foreign companies making a decision to invest in that country. \xc2\xa0I\'m the last person to give investment advice. \xc2\xa0But again, companies are going to evaluate the political climate of a country when they\'re making these investment decisions. \xc2\xa0And the impact that those investment decisions could have on the Egyptian economy are significant. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because I\'m going to take the bait on the student loan thing --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Thank you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- the President made some references to that in the State of the Union. \xc2\xa0Will he go beyond the statements he made in the State of the Union? \xc2\xa0And will this require additional spending?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get too far ahead of his announcements. \xc2\xa0And we will have, at some point, some of our policy experts who can brief you on the detailed proposals. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\'s why I asked you to compare and contrast with the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So what I will tell you is that there will be proposals beyond what the President rolled out in the State of the Union that will be included in the President\'s remarks this week. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President believe that one of the reasons college tuition is going up is because there is a sort of arms race in federal assistance? \xc2\xa0That is to say there is more federal assistance, therefore, tuition goes up? \xc2\xa0There\'s more federal assistance to compensate for that and for parents who are trying to keep up -- they continuously fall behind?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You are identifying something that the President has talked about a little bit before publicly, which is this idea that we need to rearrange the incentives a little bit, that maybe there\'s a way for us to align the incentives with colleges focusing on reducing costs for students or at least limiting the rapid growth in those costs. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President has some ideas about how we can better align federal assistance with a commitment on behalf of colleges to keep costs low for students. \xc2\xa0And that will be part of something that the President will talk about this this week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will this also address some recent audit evaluations that the federal government has now replaced the banks as a collector of a lot of interest and profits, if you will, from student loan operations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know one of the chief accomplishments of the President\'s first term was finally eliminating subsidies that were paid to big banks so that they would provide student loans. \xc2\xa0And what that did was that freed up a lot additional money to expand educational assistance to students all across the country. \xc2\xa0That is a significant accomplishment of this President, and something that he campaigned on and delivered in his first term. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know if -- well, I\'ll encourage you to stay tuned about whether or not the President has more to say about that later this week. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\'m going to move around just a little bit. \xc2\xa0Let\'s see here, Steve.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Before going to Martha\'s Vineyard, Sanjay Gupta had an interesting column in CNN about marijuana -- changed his mind. \xc2\xa0He had been at one point considered by the President to be the surgeon general pick a number of years ago. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering if the White House has any reaction to that column and also if the President has been personally looking at that issue, given that the country -- the polls on marijuana have changed quite a bit since he took office in favor of legalization. \xc2\xa0Is there any change in his sort of outlook on it? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Steve, when I called on you I don\'t think I could ever have predicted that this was the question you were going to ask me. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0So I really was into the potpourri category of questions for this one. \xc2\xa0I have to confess I did not see the Sanjay Gupta column that you\'re referring to, so it\'s hard for me to comment on it at this point. \xc2\xa0So I\'ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Peter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, if I can quickly, the Egyptian Prime Minister today, Josh, says that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fear civil war in Egypt. \xc2\xa0Does the President fear civil war in Egypt?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President is very concerned about the violence that we\'ve seen in Egypt; and it seems to be particularly the violence that is emanating from government sources, from government soldiers and government security officials. \xc2\xa0That is something that the President is very concerned about. \xc2\xa0And he talked about in his statement on Thursday about the responsibility that the government has to protect its citizens and to protect the basic human rights of the citizens that they are there to govern. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that is the violence that the President is concerned about. \xc2\xa0And he certainly -- he and other senior administration officials here are concerned about that violence spreading and the destabilizing impact it could have not just within Egypt, but within the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I hope this will conclude the conversation about tranches, but one final thought about that topic, which is that we know we\'ve discussed Bright Star. \xc2\xa0We know we\'ve discussed the F-16s, and the cancelation or the delay in terms of the F-16s and that delivery. \xc2\xa0Are there any tranches -- had nothing like what\'s presently taking place in Egypt taken place, would anything have happened differently? \xc2\xa0Is anything absent those examples you\'ve given us happen differently in terms of the tranches either being delayed or held for some period of time beyond what would otherwise occur?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I hesitate to evaluate the counterfactual that you\'ve set up there, only because my detailed knowledge of these tranches is limited. \xc2\xa0So I guess I would encourage you to check with the State Department and the Defense Department on that, because they\'ll have a little bit more detailed knowledge of what kinds of tranches are under consideration right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Fine. \xc2\xa0In Syria, 30,000 refugees have flooded into Iraq -- described by humanitarian aid workers on the ground there it\'s one of the biggest waves. \xc2\xa0This is all over the course of the last five days. \xc2\xa0They joined about I think it\'s like approaching 2 million Syrians who have fled. \xc2\xa0Is the U.S. getting any closer to its goal of removing Assad from power there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me say a couple of things about this. \xc2\xa0The first is the President himself has talked about his concern about the refugee situation in countries that neighbor Syria. \xc2\xa0So he has talked about the humanitarian conditions. \xc2\xa0Some of these refugees are living in very difficult conditions there. \xc2\xa0These are often women and children that we\'re talking about. \xc2\xa0We have provided -- the United States government has provided to other countries in the region significant financial assistance to try to meet some of those humanitarian medical needs that those refugees may need. \xc2\xa0The President talked about this when he was standing next to the King of Jordan earlier in the spring when we were in Amman. \xc2\xa0So that\'s something that the President has spoken out about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He has also talked about the destabilizing impact that these refugee populations could have on these other countries. \xc2\xa0This is and has been in recent years a pretty volatile region. \xc2\xa0And adding this broader shift in refugee populations to that mix only makes the situation more complicated and maybe even more volatile. \xc2\xa0So we\'re certainly concerned about the impact of these refugee populations. \xc2\xa0And it is a direct result of the violence that the Assad regime has perpetrated against the Syrian people. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are we closer to the goal of getting Assad out of power?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That is a goal -- first and foremost, that is the goal of the Syrian people to have a government that reflects their will.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But we\'re assisting?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We are providing assistance. \xc2\xa0That is also the goal of our allies around the world and other countries within the region. \xc2\xa0And that is -- that remains the goal. \xc2\xa0And we continue to provide assistance trying to reach it. \xc2\xa0In terms of evaluating sort of where we are on that scale --</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have we made progress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that there is no doubt that there is pretty broad international consensus about Mr. Assad and his regime and his need to leave power, and the way in which he\xe2\x80\x99s -- and how the way in which he has conducted himself has delegitimized his authority. \xc2\xa0So I think on that front, yes, some progress has been made. \xc2\xa0But there\'s no doubt that what\'s ongoing there continues to be a terrible situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me ask you on other topic domestically, if I can. \xc2\xa0In the eighth largest city in the United States, San Diego, the mayor there is facing a recall effort. \xc2\xa0There\'s mediation that we have heard through a series of reports right now. \xc2\xa0Even Bob Filner himself, the mayor of the city, has conceded that what he did was "inappropriate and wrong." \xc2\xa0Does the President have any opinion about whether Bob Filner should remain mayor of San Diego?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President hasn\'t weighed in on this issue and I haven\'t talked to him about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As the leader of the Democratic Party though, why wouldn\'t the President choose to weigh in on this issue as many other leading Democrats have, as he is a leading Democrat in a major American city, committing acts that he concedes to that the President has spoken out against in a series of other forums?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\'t spoken to the President about it, Peter. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Emel.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I want to go back to the Prime Minister\'s remarks on Egypt. \xc2\xa0Erdogan claims that Turkish government has proof that Israel was behind military coup in Egypt. \xc2\xa0Do you have any --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We strongly condemn the statements that were made by Prime Minister Erdogan today. \xc2\xa0Suggesting that Israel is somehow responsible for recent events in Egypt is offensive, unsubstantiated and wrong. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Statements like these only distract from the urgent need for all countries in the region, and frankly many leading countries around the world to work together through constructive dialogue to address the fluid and dangerous situation in Egypt.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Also on Egypt, in an interview with the Prime Minister, he said that the goal of the authorities in Egypt remained to return Egypt to a true democratic government, that they\xe2\x80\x99re keen to end this transitional period. \xc2\xa0And they\'re putting a timetable between six and nine months when they will have elections. \xc2\xa0Is that a timetable the United States supports -- six and nine months?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t see the full text of the interview, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to weigh in other than to observe that the actions that we saw from the interim government at the end of last week and over the weekend are entirely inconsistent with any democratically elected government. \xc2\xa0You would expect a democratically elected government to be -- to respect the basic human rights of the people that they\'re elected to govern. \xc2\xa0And this interim government egregiously and grievously violated the human rights of innocent protesters, peaceful protesters in Egypt. \xc2\xa0And that\'s something that the President himself has personally condemned and is something that continues to be a subject of concern here at the White House and across the administration.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Understanding that that is your position in the violence, is there any encouragement in these words -- again, the Egyptian government saying that they intend to hold elections within six to nine months? \xc2\xa0Is that an encouraging sign for the administration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think at this point we\xe2\x80\x99re going to evaluate the position of the interim government when it comes to democracy based on their actions, not on their words. \xc2\xa0And that would include as a very first preliminary step beginning to respect the basic human rights of the Egyptian people and to at least signal a transition to an inclusive political process.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does that mean releasing prisoners?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And that would include ending the politically motivated detention of individuals in Egypt.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Go ahead, Jim.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Another statement that he made which seemed to be on the other end of encouraging is that he said that the Egyptian army would survive without United States support and reminded the world that at one point, the Egyptian people went with the Russian military. \xc2\xa0What is the response of the American government on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I did see part of that interview -- that section of the interview. \xc2\xa0I think he made reference to the impact of canceling U.S. aid being bad for the military. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things about this, our relationship -- the United States -- the relationship between the United States and Egypt is a deep and multifaceted one. \xc2\xa0They have been allies with the United States for quite some time. \xc2\xa0And there are deep ties between the American people and the Egyptian people; that there are Egyptian Americans in this country today who are concerned about the safety and wellbeing of their family members in Egypt. \xc2\xa0So there is a lot at stake that the United States has in this situation, particularly because we are genuinely interested in the success of Egypt.</p>\n<p>That\'s one of the reasons that we have this deep aid and assistance relationship that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about so much today. \xc2\xa0The United States seeks a thriving, growing, stable Egypt. \xc2\xa0And some of the actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the interim government do not contribute to that stability and to a nation that\'s thriving.</p>\n<p>So I think the other point that I would want to make here is that the relationship between the U.S. and Egypt goes beyond just the aid and assistance that we\xe2\x80\x99re providing, that our actions here in the U.S. will have an impact on the foreign investment decisions that are made by countries around the globe that are looking to -- at least that are considering an investment in Egypt.</p>\n<p>The relationship between the United States and Egypt is going to have some bearing on those investment decisions. \xc2\xa0The same can be said of the IMF decision and the decision of the IMF to support the Egyptian economy. \xc2\xa0The relationship between the United States and Egypt is going to have some bearing on the outcome of that decision.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Tourism is a key component of the Egypt economy. \xc2\xa0The relationship between the United States and Egypt is going to have some bearing on the decision of thousands of people who are considering whether or not to travel to Egypt to view the antiquities there.</p>\n<p>So there are a whole range of ways in which the relationship between the United States and Egypt will have an impact on the success of Egypt, and what we are oriented toward is a set of policies and a relationship that will solidify the relationship between the United States and Egypt and the broader success of the nation and the people of Egypt.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just one final thing on Beau Biden. \xc2\xa0The White House put out kind of a rare statement on Beau Biden yesterday I presume because the Vice President had traveled to Houston.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the Vice President -- has the Vice President had to change any schedule? \xc2\xa0Do you expect him back in Washington today? \xc2\xa0What is -- what can you give us about that now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any updates about the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule. \xc2\xa0I know that the -- that his staff is committed to keeping all of you updated on his travel arrangements and on his schedule for the remainder of the week. \xc2\xa0For example, I know that the Vice President is currently scheduled to join the President in Scranton, Pennsylvania for an event on the college tour.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s one other thing that I can tell you about this which is that the President had the opportunity to speak on the telephone with the Vice President over the weekend on this topic. \xc2\xa0In that telephone call, the President offered his good wishes to Beau and told the Vice President that Beau and the rest of the Biden family would be in his thoughts and prayers.</p>\n<p>I can also tell you that a lot of people all across the country woke up with Beau Biden on their mind and in their prayers, and I can tell you that that\'s true of just about everybody that I spoke to at the White House today too. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, thanks. \xc2\xa0Switch to the Miami Dolphins. \xc2\xa0You took a question yesterday about how this came about, whose idea was it. \xc2\xa0What did you find out?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I have to admit, Roger, that I\xe2\x80\x99m not the only person who is not exactly sure how this event came to be. \xc2\xa0I talked to a couple of other folks and didn\'t get an answer on this, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll do some more digging and see what I can come up with for you.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did it come -- did the request come from the Dolphins? \xc2\xa0The NFL?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I don\'t know exactly how this -- how this exactly started, but we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly excited about the event this afternoon.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, since you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the President and the college tour, well, the tour that he\xe2\x80\x99s having and college is one of the issues, and how college makes many persons middle class, within the middle-class status, there is an issue right now where HBCUs are very concerned and have petitioned the President for a meeting and petitioned the Department of Education about something called the Parent PLUS Loan. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a federal loan that has -- now has strict requirements where parents are now being rejected. \xc2\xa0And many schools are losing money. \xc2\xa0Apparently if you have a blemish on your credit report over the last five years, you are not getting that loan. \xc2\xa0What is the President saying about this? \xc2\xa0Is he planning on meeting with these university presidents? \xc2\xa0And what is the Education Department going to do about this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the specific meeting request, but I can certainly take a look into it.</p>\n<p>The President and this administration have been strong supporters of historically black colleges and universities all across the country. \xc2\xa0Funding for those colleges and universities has increased under President Obama. \xc2\xa0And the President was pleased to have the opportunity earlier this spring to speak at the commencement at Moorehouse College down in Atlanta. \xc2\xa0So the record -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on these issues -- he has a bias in favor of historically black colleges and universities because of the service they provide and because of the quality education that they provide to their students.</p>\n<p>In terms of this issue with the Parent PLUS Loan, I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with this specific policy issue. \xc2\xa0But we can try to find somebody here at the White House who is a little more conversant in the issue who can talk to you about it.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me clarify something. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not just HBCUs as well. \xc2\xa0We understand a million students from mainstream colleges are not able to go back to school because their parents have blemishes on their credit report, and they\'re not getting this loan. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s a couple hundred thousand kids from HBCUs. \xc2\xa0So this is an across-the-board issue. \xc2\xa0HBCUs are really being hurt by it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s -- let me have somebody in DPC get in touch with you, and we can walk through where we are on that issue.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, the AP is crossing that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a Cabinet-level meeting this afternoon here at the White House to discuss this Egyptian aid issue. \xc2\xa0Is that true?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President will convene a National Security Council meeting with principals on his national security team to talk about this issue. \xc2\xa0So the President convenes these kinds of meetings on a regular basis, but that will be the topic of --</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So how pivotal -- in the range so as not to overplay or underplay it, you said this has been under review for some time, for the President to be involved with Cabinet-level officials suggests that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting closer to a decision. \xc2\xa0Where would you categorize this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I would say is that these kinds of national security meetings are not uncommon. \xc2\xa0The President does chair them on a pretty regular basis, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s not even the first one that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had on this topic. \xc2\xa0At this point I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate any major announcements related our aid and assistance in the immediate aftermath of this meeting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What time is the NSC meeting?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s at 2:30 p.m. \xc2\xa0We can double check on that for you.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just switching topics a little to the looming fiscal issues of next month. \xc2\xa0Before Congress left, they were some meetings between the Chief of Staff, a series of behind-the-scenes meetings with some Republican senators. \xc2\xa0The President I think Jay had told us spoke briefly to the Speaker before he left. \xc2\xa0But where are we? \xc2\xa0Has there been progress? \xc2\xa0Are those meetings still ongoing? \xc2\xa0And sort of where are we when they come back in three weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t know that there are any meetings I have to read out to you. \xc2\xa0Members of Congress are scattered across the country in their home districts. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t have any specific meetings to read out to you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I know that our position on this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve articulated to you in a variety of forums. \xc2\xa0I think I would -- it would suffice it to say that threatening to shut down the government would have a terrible impact on our economy. \xc2\xa0And the President is focused in putting in place policies that would be good for the middle class and be good for our economy. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And like I said threats to under -- threats to shut down the government would only undermine the economic recovery that\'s starting to gain some traction.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the Chief of Staff though continued talking to those senators that he was speaking to or talking to --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any specific calls to read out to you, but the lines of communication remain open.</p>\n<p>Zeke, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0You said before that the biggest tranches of aid have been stopped, including the aircraft sales, as well as the military exercise. \xc2\xa0Is it safe to say that any other large tranches of aid will be stopped going forward as they have been over the past five, six weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say is that we\xe2\x80\x99re evaluating these tranches based on -- on a case-by-case basis. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll evaluate each one.</p>\n<p>I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s been publicly reported that there is at some point a scheduled delivery of Apache helicopters coming up. \xc2\xa0That\'s something that the Department of Defense knows more about than I do, but that is an example of the kind of aid that is currently under the review. \xc2\xa0A decision about the delivery of those helicopters has not been made at this point. \xc2\xa0But when it is, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make an announcement about that in the same that we announced the decision on the delay and the delivery of F-16s.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What would have to change on the ground for those helicopters to be sold?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re like I said evaluating on a case-by-case basis, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing review.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the criteria?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And the context of that review includes actions taken by the Egyptian government. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to lay out like specific criteria: \xc2\xa0if this, then this. \xc2\xa0But I can observe for you generally that continued violations of basic human rights don\'t make the transfer of that aid more likely.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, one quick question.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0All right, Alexis. \xc2\xa0Last one.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could you please, just to follow up to Martha -- has the President made any calls since he got back from vacation to either lawmakers or other heads of state to discuss Egypt and aid?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to read out at this time.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But that\'s possible.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible. \xc2\xa0But nothing that I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to announce at this time.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0Have a good afternoon. \xc2\xa0Enjoy the Dolphins.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:00 P.M.
