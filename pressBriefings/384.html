Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:57 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 Before we get started today, I just want to let you know there\xe2\x80\x99s been one brief addition to the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 This afternoon, he will be convening a conference call with the members of the USAID DART team who are currently deployed to West Africa, responding to the Ebola outbreak in that region of the world.</p>\n<p>These are individuals who have been on the ground in West Africa since I believe the first week in August.\xc2\xa0 They are responsible for coordinating the government\xe2\x80\x99s response to this Ebola situation.\xc2\xa0 And the President is obviously very grateful for their service.\xc2\xa0 As you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say on a couple of previous occasions, the only way that we can entirely eliminate the risk to the American people from the Ebola virus is to stop this outbreak at the source.\xc2\xa0 And these men and women who are government employees have been on the ground in West Africa working to accomplish exactly that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President will be calling to offer his gratitude on behalf of the nation for their work.\xc2\xa0 Upon completion of that call, as the President walks from his office to the helicopter, the President will make a statement about that call prior to departure.\xc2\xa0 So you should plan on that accordingly.</p>\n<p>So with that, Nedra, would you like to get us started?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Josh, on that call, is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s way of basically showing appreciation at a time when maybe some of these workers could be subject to quarantine?\xc2\xa0 Is he trying to send a different message?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, the message that the President is trying to deliver is that they have a critically important role in our response to this Ebola situation.\xc2\xa0 And simply put, their work is critical to ensuring that we entirely eliminate the risk associated with the Ebola virus to the American people, and that\xe2\x80\x99s to stop this outbreak at the source.</p>\n<p>And that work can only be done based on the skill and professionalism of those who are serving on the ground.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen countries around the world make significant contributions to this effort, but no one has committed more than the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 And the heart of this effort is this DART team that\xe2\x80\x99s operating on the ground with the support of CDC and other government agencies that are responsible for responding to this effort.</p>\n<p>But the President and in fact the entire nation is grateful for their service, and the President wanted to take a little time out of his day to offer that gratitude.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We heard Dr. Fauci say this morning that states are within their rights to impose stricter sanctions than what the CDC is recommending.\xc2\xa0 But is there any concern that there is not a uniform policy, and that that could be sowing confusion?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the thing that there should be no confusion about is the risk that is associated with the Ebola virus in this country.\xc2\xa0 The risk to the average American is vanishingly low, as Dr. Fauci himself has said.\xc2\xa0 We know this because the science indicates exactly how this virus is transmitted.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not possible to get this virus by drinking food -- drinking water or eating food in this country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not possible to contract the Ebola virus by breathing air in this country.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we know that the only way that you can catch the Ebola virus is to come in close contact with the bodily fluids of an individual that is already exhibiting symptoms of Ebola.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In fact, there are only two instances where the Ebola virus has been transmitted in this country, and that is a virus that has transmitted to two health care workers who were treating a very sick Ebola patient.\xc2\xa0 In other good news that was announced earlier today, the second of those two health care workers is slated to be released from a hospital in Atlanta later today.\xc2\xa0 So there are only two instances where the virus was transmitted on American soil, and both of those health care workers who contracted the virus on American soil have been treated.\xc2\xa0 And as of this afternoon, both will be virus-free and released from treatment.\xc2\xa0 So that certainly is welcome news and we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to see it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President had a meeting with administration officials here on Sunday for a couple hours, including Secretary Hagel.\xc2\xa0 So how come the Pentagon then came out with a different policy for some of this toward West Africa?\xc2\xa0 And isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the kind of thing that someone like Ron Klain should be coordinating within the government?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ron Klain is responsible for coordinating our whole-of-government response to the Ebola situation.\xc2\xa0 He has performed very well in that task.\xc2\xa0 The President and everyone here at the White House who has a role in working on this effort is appreciative of the kind of management expertise that he\xe2\x80\x99s bringing to this challenge.\xc2\xa0 And the impact of his work is already being felt both here at the White House but across the government.</p>\n<p>As it relates to this specific policy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a particular surprise to anybody who understands that it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for the policy that\xe2\x80\x99s implemented for civilians to be different than the policy that\xe2\x80\x99s implemented for our military service personnel.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual.\xc2\xa0 And that takes a variety of forms.\xc2\xa0 In this case, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a policy that\xe2\x80\x99s still under consideration, I might add, by the Secretary of Defense.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest that any sort of -- that I\xe2\x80\x99m getting ahead of any sort of policy announcement that\xe2\x80\x99s made by the Department of Defense.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the policy that is evidently under consideration is one that would restrict the movements of service personnel that had been working in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 And this illustrates the kind of different challenges that both -- that our civilian governments are dealing with and the challenges that our military is dealing with.\xc2\xa0 When we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about our civilian governments -- or our civilians, and what sort of policy is in place to monitor the health of health care workers who are returning from West Africa, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a couple of dozen health care workers a week who are returning to this country from West Africa.\xc2\xa0 When we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about military personnel, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about thousands of military servicemembers who have been or will be deployed to West Africa to carry out the mission that the President ordered.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd it simply will be easier to directly and actively monitor their health if their movements are restricted to certain locations.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about thousands of military personnel that are traveling from bases all across the globe.\xc2\xa0 And in order to monitor their health, it simply is easier to do that if their movements are restricted and they\xe2\x80\x99re all co-located.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, the other thing that is important for us I think at this point to acknowledge is that this is indicative of the kinds of sacrifices that our military servicemembers make on a daily basis; that there are a wide range of sacrifices that our men and women in uniform make for the sake of efficiency and for the sake of uniformity and for the success of our military.</p>\n<p>So to take a more pedestrian example than the medical one that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, there might be some members of the military who think that the haircut that\xe2\x80\x99s required may not be their best, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a haircut that they get every couple of weeks because it is in the best interest of their unit and it maintains unit cohesion, and that is a policy of the military, and that obviously is a situation in which application of military policy is not -- or is necessarily different than the application of the policy in a civilian context.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about haircuts.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the outbreak of this disease here that has deadly implications.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Of course we\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to suggest that it\xe2\x80\x99s somehow unimportant.\xc2\xa0 I think it is a useful illustration, though, that the kinds of sacrifices that our men and women make in uniform range from very simple, elemental things, like a haircut, to more serious things like medical quarantine.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is those are the kinds of things that have an impact on their day-to-day personal convenience, but yet they make those sacrifices for the benefit of the broader military.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess my question is, is the White House concerned that a patchwork of different policies between states, the military, what the CDC is saying, is sowing confusion, or is that perfectly acceptable to have all these different standards from your viewpoint?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that actually reflects the entirety of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening as well.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are a couple of states -- New York and New Jersey -- that have gotten a lot of attention in the last couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is, if you look at announcements that have been made by other states -- states like Maryland, Virginia, Minnesota, Georgia, Connecticut, the District of Columbia -- all have issued<br/>\n\tpolicies that are much closer to the kinds of policies that were recommended by the Centers for Disease Control.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I do think that we\'re starting to see an emerging consensus from other states about the policies that can be best implemented to protect their civilians.</p>\n<p>Steven.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the Australians have issued a blanket visa ban.\xc2\xa0 Did you have any reaction to that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an immediate reaction.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, individual governments are going to make decisions about what they believe is in the best interests of their populations.</p>\n<p>The President has made his own decision about the wisdom of a travel ban.\xc2\xa0 It is his view that implementing a travel ban would not be in the best interests of the safety and well-being of the American people.\xc2\xa0 It would only serve as a disincentive for people to be candid about their travel history.</p>\n<p>The reason we want people to be candid about their travel history is because if they\xe2\x80\x99ve recently traveled in West Africa and had exposure to Ebola patients, then we want to make sure that they\'re properly screened before they enter the country.\xc2\xa0 And even if they are not exhibiting symptoms of Ebola, we want to make sure that they have the information that they need to get medical attention and treatment quickly if that should be necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you haven\xe2\x80\x99t raised any concerns with the Australians about this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department for any sorts of communications between our government and theirs.\xc2\xa0 But, again, we certainly respect the right of nations like Australia to make their own decisions about what they believe is in the best interest of their citizens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\'re a week out from the elections.\xc2\xa0 How confident are you at this point that Democrats will retain the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We continue to be confident because of the message that the vast majority of Democratic Senate candidates are carrying about how important it is for Congress to be advancing policies that benefit middle-class families.</p>\n<p>That\'s in the best interest of the country.\xc2\xa0 I think it also is a value that the vast majority of voters agree on.\xc2\xa0 There are others who are more steeped in these details that would suggest that they have confidence in the outcome because of the advantage that Democrats have on the ground, that many Democratic candidates have been able to apply the lessons learned from the success of the Obama campaign in 2012 to benefit their own campaigns, and that there are some early data to indicate that those strategies are having -- are being successfully implemented this time around as well.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my colleagues at the DNC and other places that may have a more granular assessment to share.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And the President, we\'re told, spoke to the newly elected -- newly reelected Brazilian President.\xc2\xa0 Did he invite her back to Washington?\xc2\xa0 All the frictions about the surveillance practices, are they gone now?\xc2\xa0 Or is some of that still there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President certainly was pleased to have the opportunity to congratulate President Rousseff on her reelection.\xc2\xa0 The President does value the strong working relationship that he has had personally with President Rousseff, but also the strong working relationship that has existed between Brazil and the United States for quite some time now.</p>\n<p>I don\'t have any announcements to make about possible travel or invitations that might be extended, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted.\xc2\xa0 A Brazilian state dinner would certainly be a sight to see, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a couple clarifications on the military question.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you had said -- I think you said something about this is -- you\'re waiting to see whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a recommendation and you\'re waiting to see whether it\xe2\x80\x99s actually adopted.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s true, though, the Army actually implemented the policy yesterday, right?\xc2\xa0 They announced it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The Army did make an announcement, but the Secretary of Defense is considering a department-wide policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Department-wide policy, okay.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And so I didn\'t want to suggest in answering Nedra\xe2\x80\x99s question that I was prejudging the outcome of any sort of decision that the Secretary of Defense should rightly make.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and then just to follow up.\xc2\xa0 I understand how the Army and the broader Defense Department could well have policies that maybe make sense for them that don\'t make sense to the civilian population.\xc2\xa0 But I think people looking at and hearing you guys talk about how these policies should be driven by the science, right -- and Dr. Fauci spent much of the morning today talking about you associate the risk level with the level of punishment or the level of restriction that you put on somebody based on the scientific risk level.\xc2\xa0 And then you see the Defense Department saying that people who are coming back, soldiers who are coming back who specifically are not medical providers, right, like you guys have said that and you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that from the podium a lot that these people aren\'t actually dealing directly with patients, so they\xe2\x80\x99re at least one step if not multiple steps removed from the health care workers who are actually suiting up and being with the patients, and that those people then are -- who are hammering the -- building the hospitals are now being told to be isolated by the military.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys view that as being driven by the same science that Dr. Fauci is talking about?\xc2\xa0 Because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like that\'s being driven by that science.\xc2\xa0 It may be driven by other elements, but it\'s not the science that you guys want, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not sure if your question does this, but let me just put this on the table for broader discussion.\xc2\xa0 It would be wrong to suggest that it would make the American people safer to apply this military policy in a civilian context.\xc2\xa0 The science would not back up -- back that up.\xc2\xa0 In fact, implementing this military policy in a civilian context would only have the effect of hindering our Ebola response by dissuading civilian doctors and nurses from traveling to West Africa to stop the outbreak in its tracks.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve also heard me say many times the only way that we can entirely eliminate the Ebola risk to the American people is to stop this outbreak in its tracks in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the first thing.</p>\n<p>The second thing is -- and in some ways, this goes back to the numbers -- what Dr. Frieden discussed yesterday in talking about the kinds of measures that should be in place to monitor the health of health care workers who are returning from West Africa is that they will conduct essentially a personalized assessment of each traveler as they\xe2\x80\x99re returning.\xc2\xa0 That is something that is possible to do because there are only a couple dozen a week who are returning from West Africa to the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that is slimmed down even further that these individuals are spread across five different airports.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s possible to conduct a personalized assessment, both of the risk that each individual faced when they were in West Africa and how that risk should impact the kind of monitoring that this individual receives.</p>\n<p>And that\'s the way that this policy is implemented in a civilian context, because the science tells us that the only way that you can transmit the Ebola virus is when you\'re exhibiting symptoms and somebody comes into close contact with the bodily fluids that you excrete while you\'re exhibiting those symptoms.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why we\'re focused on the health and whether or not somebody is exhibiting symptoms.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\'s much more difficult, I think for obvious reasons, to conduct a personalized assessment of risk and tailor a monitoring regime for them when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about thousands of people who performed a wide variety of functions in a wide variety of locations in this region of the world, and when they\xe2\x80\x99re preparing to travel back to a wide range of localities not just around the United States but around the globe.\xc2\xa0 These are -- the men and women who are being deployed to West Africa are coming from military installations around the world.\xc2\xa0 And so for the sake of efficiency, there\xe2\x80\x99s an obvious benefit to restricting the movements of these individuals so that their health can be monitored, consistent with scientific guidelines.</p>\n<p>And so the last thing I\'ll say about your question, Mike, and I think in some ways this might get to the core of it here, that what we\'re talking about is the implementation of a policy that is consistent with the science; that we are -- both military leaders and civilian leaders acknowledge that after spending time in West Africa, the health of these individuals should be monitored.\xc2\xa0 And in the military context, the way that this monitoring recommendation is applied is by closely restricting the movements of our military personnel so that that monitoring can be done.</p>\n<p>I think we would all acknowledge that that is going to make personal life for some servicemembers a little inconvenient, but what we know about our men and women in uniform is, one, that they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to make sacrifices for the sake of the broader efficiency of the military.\xc2\xa0 We also know that there are other ways in which their basic life will not be as disrupted as a civilian\xe2\x80\x99s would.\xc2\xa0 For example, our military personnel, while their movements are restricted, would continue to receive a paycheck.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that when applied in a civilian context may not be possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The last thing is -- and this sort of goes to something that somebody raised yesterday -- when we\'re talking about medical professionals who are going to West Africa, these are individuals who are volunteering to do so.\xc2\xa0 That is why their service and commitment to serving their fellow man is worthy of a lot of praise and respect.\xc2\xa0 When we\'re talking about military members, these are individuals who signed up for the military and they\xe2\x80\x99re ordered to travel to West Africa.\xc2\xa0 So the notion that we may impose an undue burden, or at least impose some inconvenience on them, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect their ability to fulfill the mission.\xc2\xa0 Despite the inconvenience, we know that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to go serve their country because they\xe2\x80\x99re ordered to do so by their Commander-in-Chief.</p>\n<p>The calculation for a civilian is different.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who have responsibilities that we wouldn\'t want to -- well, let me say it this way:\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who we wouldn\'t want to unduly burden because we\'re asking them to volunteer their expertise and knowledge to stop this outbreak at the source.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Richard.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Power has been requesting a wider, larger involvement of different countries in the fight against the Ebola virus in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry is in Canada.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s in Canada -- is he going to bring this request to the Canadian government?\xc2\xa0 Is this the kind of the work he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do over there?\xc2\xa0 And also, I\'d like to know if the President himself is involved in reaching to other leaders and saying -- and asking for more people on the ground.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Richard, the President has made a number of phone calls over the last couple of weeks to world leaders to urge them to make a greater commitment to the international Ebola response in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 Again, the only way that we can entirely eliminate risk from the Ebola virus to the American people is to stop this outbreak at the source.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s going to require the international community marshalling sufficient resources and personnel and equipment, focusing in on this region of the world and stopping this outbreak.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President committed Department of Defense resources to lend their logistical expertise to make the flow of equipment, supplies and personnel into that region of the world more efficient.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen that that has galvanized the international community to respond more robustly to this urgent need.\xc2\xa0 And the President has had a number of conversations with world leaders to encourage them to ramp up their commitment.</p>\n<p>We can get you -- we can follow up with you to get you some more specifics about who the President has called and what sort of commitments have resulted from those conversations that the President has convened.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, Chris Christie said this morning about the CDC, \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\'t want to admit it that we\'re right and they were wrong. I\'m sorry about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 There seems to be still quite a disagreement of how things are playing out.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering<br/>\n\t\xe2\x80\x93-</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a disagreement about the need for Nurse Hickox to be released.\xc2\xa0 She was released consistent with the guidance from the CDC and she is making her way -- presumably has arrived in her home in Maine, again, consistent with the guidance that were articulated by the CDC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President gotten around to talking to Governor Christie yet?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, we had a number of -- I don\'t remember if you were here yesterday -- we had a number of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was here.\xc2\xa0 I thought maybe --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You may remember as vividly as I do that I\'m just not going to get into a detailed accounting of the conversations that have taken place between members of the administration and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because he sure leaves the impression that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had the chance to talk to the President.\xc2\xa0 It seems kind of strange that this is the governor of one of the states with one of the five airports that you\xe2\x80\x99ve cited, putting these extra procedures in place.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t some coordination be appropriate?\xc2\xa0 It seems like if they had spoken, I imagine he would have told us.\xc2\xa0 How is that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten around to talking to the governor?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t assume that.\xc2\xa0 There are --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in the interest of transparency, you would tell us if they had spoken, I assume.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good one.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that -- what I can tell you is that there are -- administration officials from a wide variety of agencies have been in very close touch with New Jersey officials for exactly the reasons that you\'re citing; that New Jersey is one of the locations where travelers from West Africa are arriving in the United States via commercial air travel.</p>\n<p>And there is in place in -- at Newark Airport a monitoring regime -- or a screening regime that is supervised by the CDC, that is carried out by CBP officers.\xc2\xa0 And there has been close coordination between those individuals who are conducting that screening and public health officials on New Jersey who have worked to ensure that health care workers have the supplies and training necessary to take in any Ebola patients if they\'re caught in that screening.</p>\n<p>So that is one indication of the level of coordination that\'s underway.\xc2\xa0 I already cited the other example, which is that Kaci Hickox, the nurse who had recently traveled to West Africa, has been released consistent with the scientific advice that had been offered by the CDC.\xc2\xa0 So I think there are a couple of ways that we can illustrate the kind of coordination that you would expect at the state level between the federal government and New Jersey officials.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d also point out, again, states like Maryland, Virginia, Minnesota, Georgia, Connecticut, the District of Columbia are all places that have also issued guidelines that hew much closer to the scientific guidance from the CDC and is indicative of the kind of coordination that exists between the federal government and all 50 states.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, you had -- when asked about the defense -- about the Army policy, you said that this was made by one commanding officer in the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us who that commanding officer was?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at the conclusion of our -- at the conclusion of the briefing yesterday, or I guess maybe it was even in the early evening, General Odierno made this announcement about Army policy.</p>\n<p>That is the policy that is currently --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s not just one commanding officer.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the Chief of Staff of the United States Army.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Army --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And that was -- again, that was an announcement that was made after the briefing that we had yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he the one commanding officer you were referring to?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I was not -- because that announcement had not been made in the context of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s briefing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Army represents the overwhelming majority of those that are serving right now in West Africa?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear to me exactly what the breakdown is, but there are --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense tells me of the 4,000 that will eventually be in place, 3,200 at least will be Army.\xc2\xa0 So this is effectively -- you say there\xe2\x80\x99s no Department of Defense policy yet, but the Army represents the bulk of those here, and the bulk of those who will be subject to this policy that General Odierno has announced.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that even General Odierno would defer to the rightful role of the Secretary of Defense in setting department-wide policy when it comes to measures like this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the Secretary of Defense will reverse the Army on this?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\'s a possibility?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prejudge the outcome of a decision that\'s made by the Secretary of Defense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and there\xe2\x80\x99s one other question.\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw the ABC News/Washington Post poll --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I had a chance to catch it this morning, Jon.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you can fill me in, though.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will.\xc2\xa0 In our poll, and this is something we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in several other polls over the last several months, 60 percent said they have little or no trust in the federal government to do what\xe2\x80\x99s right, and 63 percent believe that the government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to deal with problems has actually gotten worse over the last few years.\xc2\xa0 What do you make of this?</p>\n<p>Obviously, President Obama is somebody who came into office intent on restoring the public\xe2\x80\x99s faith in the ability of government to make their lives better; to see this where you have such a high percentage of the American public saying they have little or no faith in the federal government.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\'t account for the answers that presumably were given by several hundred Americans.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that this administration has placed a priority on ensuring that the United States, as it has long been, continues to be a force for good in the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And whether that is responding to a situation like an Ebola outbreak in West Africa that nobody else wants to have to deal with, that the United States of America is the one nation that\'s willing to stand up and make a significant commitment in a way that actually galvanizes a response from countries and organizations around the world; that it\xe2\x80\x99s the United States the world turns to when the President says we need to build an international coalition to take the fight to a terrible extremist organization like ISIL that threatens to destabilize an entire region of the world.\xc2\xa0 And so it\xe2\x80\x99s the United States -- and under this President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership -- that a coalition of more than 60 nations has been built to take this fight to ISIL.</p>\n<p>Here at home, you have seen a pretty aggressive response from this President in the early days of his administration when we were on the precipice of a second Great Depression that because of the policies that this administration put in place supporting our men -- our workers, our innovators, and our entrepreneurs who eventually led us back from the depths of that economic downturn in a way that has surprised a lot of observers, even some of our observers in-house that the resilience of the American economy continues to grow at a rate that has surprised many experts.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President himself say that the United States of America had created more jobs since that economic downturn than Europe, Japan, and other large economies combined.</p>\n<p>So this, I think, is indicative of the important role that the United States has to play both in terms of confronting problems on a global scale, but also making sure that the needs of middle-class families here at home are met as well.\xc2\xa0 And I recognize that there is plenty of skepticism about that, and I think that is indicative of your poll.\xc2\xa0 But I also think that a close examination of this President\xe2\x80\x99s record indicates that people can feel very good about the United States government, particularly under leadership of this President, being a force for good in the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s such skepticism on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 The pollsters that you pay good money to conduct that poll probably would have better insight than I would on that.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to Ron Klain, you said earlier that he\xe2\x80\x99s performed very well in his task so far.\xc2\xa0 What has he done?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are -- I guess there are a couple of ways to answer that question.\xc2\xa0 The first is, Ron is somebody who since Wednesday -- so I guess we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about his seventh day on the job; he certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the chance to take the weekend off, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that -- that\xe2\x80\x99s somebody that since Wednesday has been very hard at work in coordinating the whole-of-government approach that the President had mandated for responding to the Ebola situation.\xc2\xa0 And that means that Ron has arrived here at the White House early in the morning.\xc2\xa0 He stayed until late at night.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s convened a variety of meetings with senior officials here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s regularly briefed the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I know that last week he had the opportunity to travel to the Department of Health and Human Services to meet with officials there who have been working so hard on this response.\xc2\xa0 You all know that later this week Ron will be traveling to Atlanta where he\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with officials at the CDC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What day will that be?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an actual date on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s later this week.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you some more details on that.</p>\n<p>But I can tell you that this is the result of a lot of work here.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to be pleased that we\xe2\x80\x99re putting in place the policies that are driven by science, that are motivated to protect the American public, and are geared towards stopping this outbreak at the source.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way that we can entirely eliminate the risk from this disease.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think his lack of visibility could be a problem?\xc2\xa0 The New York Daily News has on its front page, where in the hell are you czar\xe2\x80\x9d -- czar you -- or something like that.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a play on words with \xe2\x80\x9cczar\xe2\x80\x9d and so forth.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Real clever.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yeah.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Maybe, maybe not.\xc2\xa0 But I suppose there could be a public perception out there that he\xe2\x80\x99s kind of invisible.\xc2\xa0 And if he\xe2\x80\x99s doing so much, why not let everybody see it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is I recognize that all of you have not had a chance to see him and talk to him every day, but the President certainly has.\xc2\xa0 And the President is appreciative of his commitment to this very difficult task.\xc2\xa0 And I think the American people are in a position where they can be confident that somebody that has extensive management credentials, both inside and outside of government, somebody that has excellent organizational skills and somebody that has a reputation for getting results is somebody that is on the task and is responsible for coordinating this very challenging problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And getting -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte, has sent a letter to Secretary Johnson and Secretary Kerry asking whether or not there are plans to admit Ebola-infected non-citizens in the U.S. for treatment.\xc2\xa0 Is there any kind of response to that?\xc2\xa0 Is that happening?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the letter.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you know whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s happening or not?\xc2\xa0 Would non-citizens be coming into the U.S. for Ebola treatment?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened so far.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any plans to do that but, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at the letter.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like he sent the letter to DHS and the State Department so you might see if they have a response to his letter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the midterms, are you guys disappointed in any way that this Ebola scare has occurred right before the midterms?\xc2\xa0 That it has just sort of come at an inopportune time?\xc2\xa0 It has thrown this White House off message somewhat -- you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to talk about the things you wanted to talk about -- is that a problem, do you think?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I would first posit I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s ever a good time for an Ebola outbreak.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 True, true.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So that said, I think that this is the kind of challenge that the American people anticipate that their government should take on.\xc2\xa0 And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a chance to review the ABC/Washington Post poll today, unfortunately, but I did have the benefit of checking out the CNN poll.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like Jon did, too.\xc2\xa0 According to the CNN poll -- maybe this is your next question -- (laughter) -- a substantial majority of Americans do have confidence in the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s response to the Ebola situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fifty-four percent, I believe.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a substantial majority?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and I think there is -- well, what I was trying to say is that there is an even larger percentage -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s like 74 percent -- do not believe that there will be a widespread outbreak in the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 What does that say to you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What does what say to me?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact that there are so many Americans -- a large majority of Americans -- who don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there will be a widespread Ebola outbreak.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an indication to me that at least a large percentage of Americans are focused on listening to the science and do understand what our scientific experts tell us, which is that the risk -- the likelihood of a widespread outbreak of Ebola inside the United States is exceedingly low and that\xe2\x80\x99s attributable to a wide variety of things.\xc2\xa0 Largely, that\xe2\x80\x99s attributable to the way that this disease is transmitted.\xc2\xa0 Some of that is attributable to the modern medical infrastructure that\xe2\x80\x99s in place in this country to treat Ebola patients in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pose a significant risk to the broader community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s also attributable to the whole-of-government approach that the President has employed in responding to this particular situation and making sure that there are guidelines in place for monitoring the health of individuals who have recently traveled in West Africa that have returned to the United States, making sure that there are guidelines in place so that health care workers can treat Ebola patients in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expose themselves or the broader community to greater risk.\xc2\xa0 It also benefits from the substantial commitment of federal resources to try to stop this outbreak at the source.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way that we entirely eliminate the risk from Ebola to the American people.</p>\n<p>So I think there are a large number of reasons that people can feel confident that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case and I was pleased to see in your poll that about three out of four Americans do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We asked, we reported, we put it out there.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There you go.\xc2\xa0 All right, thank you, Jim.</p>\n<p>Bob, what you got?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me try to ask the question of the last two days in a broader sense.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 That usually works.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Ebola --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Should we note the sarcasm in the briefing in case it was lost on anybody?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Future individuals may not benefit from the look on my face when they are -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Bob.\xc2\xa0 Go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did New Jersey officials from Governor Christie on down relent over the nurse who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t quarantine quietly, so to speak, because of discussions with the administration officials from the President on down?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s why they ended up sending her -- letting her go?\xc2\xa0 Or was it the threat of a federal lawsuit?\xc2\xa0 Were those discussions of that nature?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I think you should ask Governor Christie why he made the decision to allow her to leave.\xc2\xa0 That decision that he made is certainly consistent with the -- it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with -- well --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I tried.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The decision that he made -- I didn\'t mean to suggest that you weren\xe2\x80\x99t doing your job.\xc2\xa0 I just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just suggesting --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, no -- he isn\xe2\x80\x99t here.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- that he\xe2\x80\x99s in a better place to answer it.\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think I would just observe that the decision that he made is entirely consistent with the advice that he had received from the CDC.\xc2\xa0 And I do think that is indicative -- to his credit -- that is indicative of the strong coordination and communication that exists between his office and the Centers for Disease Control.\xc2\xa0 And he made that decision consistent with the scientific advice and the scientific expertise that\'s been amassed in the four decades since we\xe2\x80\x99ve been dealing with Ebola outbreaks in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 And we want our public officials to be in a position where their policy decisions are being driven by the science, and so he deserves credit for that.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, has this administration been working with some of the other countries who are invested in Africa?\xc2\xa0 And what are the conversations -- if you\xe2\x80\x99ve had them -- about giving and supporting and trying to contain and prevent this Ebola outbreak?</p>\n<p>And I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about countries specifically like China -- is very much invested in Africa, in Sub-Saharan Africa, and they have been working on building infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 What is the conversation with this administration and the Chinese government in reference to trying to help fight and combat the Ebola outbreak?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any specific conversations to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll check with my colleagues at the NSC and see if they can provide you some additional detail about those conversations.\xc2\xa0 I think the one thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is that, as indicated by the significant commitment that this administration has made to responding to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, no one is more invested in Africa\xe2\x80\x99s success than the United States of America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s a colorful, colloquial expression about when times get tough that you know who your friends are, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s apparent that the people in -- at least in these three West Africa countries are facing a really tough time now.\xc2\xa0 And I think they can take a lot of solace in knowing that the most powerful country in the world is their friend and is ready to back it up with the kind of concrete action that will be necessary to stop this outbreak in its tracks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, a follow on that, but right now China is considered by the IMF the greatest economy in the world.\xc2\xa0 So with that --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s true.\xc2\xa0 The greatest economy in the world?\xc2\xa0 I quibble with that notion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Read it, read it -- well, they\'re not the greatest economy.\xc2\xa0 They\'re the biggest economy -- the best -- the biggest economy in the world right now.\xc2\xa0 The IMF, go read the paper.\xc2\xa0 It was a couple weeks ago.</p>\n<p>So anyway --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have to argue about this.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead with your question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I don\'t like being discredited.\xc2\xa0 But moving on --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s all right.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s move on.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your advice.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So anyway, with them having this economy, this great world economy now being considered number one, don\'t they have -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t there --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to concede that point, so can you ask the question in a way that doesn\'t say something that I\xe2\x80\x99m not willing to accede to?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, well, let\xe2\x80\x99s -- okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s say this then, by China being the economy that they are around the world, and how they invest in Africa, do they have a responsibility?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see what the question is.\xc2\xa0 I think the simple answer to your question is yes.\xc2\xa0 I think every major economy and country in the world, regardless of the size of their economy, has a responsibility to join the international effort to stop this outbreak at the source.</p>\n<p>The President has identified this Ebola outbreak as a national security priority.\xc2\xa0 That means it\xe2\x80\x99s also a national security priority for other countries around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly would welcome the commitment of resources from countries around the world, including China, to this broader effort.</p>\n<p>I know that there has been a commitment of resources from China.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know -- I don\'t have it in front of me so I can\'t detail it for you, but we can look up some additional information for you if you\xe2\x80\x99d like, although we certainly would welcome a greater commitment from nations like China.\xc2\xa0 And the President has had a number of conversations with world leaders in the last couple of weeks about those countries making a more substantial commitment to this broader effort.</p>\n<p>But as it relates specifically to China, I just don\'t know exactly what kinds of conversations have been held and what sort of commitments that they have made.\xc2\xa0 But I think, as a general principle, I can say that nations like China should commit additional resources to this international effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the last question.\xc2\xa0 Have you heard of any -- have you heard any word from the economic persons who are dealing with the economies in those West African countries to talk about the economic impact on their countries since August, since the Ebola outbreak really started?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is one of the reasons that the President is concerned -- this is one of the things that led the President to say that this Ebola outbreak is a national security priority because it\xe2\x80\x99s having a very destabilizing impact on the region as it spreads that impact could become more significant.</p>\n<p>It also clearly has a significant economic impact; that there are -- so that is something that the President is concerned about, is concerned about the impact that could have on the local population and on the population of neighboring countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So in terms of the details of the financial toll, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department that is likely to have conducted an analysis like that.\xc2\xa0 But I think as a general matter I can tell you that the administration is concerned about the negative economic impact of this Ebola outbreak in those three countries.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, listening to your answers to Mike, it seems to be worth surmising that the reason the Army Chief of Staff issued the order he did is not for public health reasons or scientific reasons, but for reasons of order and efficiency.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair interpretation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess you should ask them exactly why they put in place that policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You gave a lengthy answer explaining the differentiation between civilian interactions and military protocols, and the fact that they get paid, the fact that they take orders, the fact that there is a efficiency component that you believe would be complicated by them returning to base wherever it is.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 So I stated all those things as a factual matter, that these are sort of clear, factual differences in terms of the consequences of implementing this policy in a military context and implementing this policy in a civilian context.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of what actually motivated him to make this decision --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, you said there was not a scientific reason to do it, and that it would actually -- if implemented in the civilian world would be harmful, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s true.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s an explanation about why we implemented --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the science doesn\'t back it up and the public health doesn\'t back it up -- other reasons back it up as a policy?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No -- again, what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say is to suggest that applying the military policy in a civilian context would make the American people safer is just wrong.\xc2\xa0 The science doesn\'t back that up.</p>\n<p>So we should acknowledge the different circumstances that exist in a military population and a civilian population.\xc2\xa0 In this military population there are -- first of all, this military population that spent time in West Africa is much larger in scope and in scale than the civilian --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But you would acknowledge that it could create confusion in the public mind to hear that members of the military who are not directly providing medical care, but are building structures and providing the airlift and all the other capabilities, are going to have isolated treatment for 21 days -- or be in isolation for 21 days, whereas a health care worker, who, as she said in her own blog, held a dying child who died from Ebola in her arms is not subject to the same level of direct, active, isolated monitoring, they would wonder, well, wait a minute, these seem to be in different risk categories.\xc2\xa0 And yet, the military is taking this much broader, extensive precaution and isolation approach, while as in the civilian world, we aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can understand how people might be confused about that.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can understand why people might suggest that there is a benefit to applying a military -- military policy that works in a military context and suggesting that it might work in a civilian context.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that\'s wrong.\xc2\xa0 The science doesn\'t back that up.</p>\n<p>General Odierno and eventually Secretary Hagel will have to discuss why they made the decision to implement this policy in the military context.\xc2\xa0 I think as a factual matter, we can observe that this military population is substantially larger when compared to the population of health care workers that are returning to this country from West Africa.</p>\n<p>Because the population that\'s returning from West Africa is -- the population of health care workers that\'s returning from West Africa to this country is smaller, it\xe2\x80\x99s more feasible to actually conduct a personalized risk assessment and tailor the kind of monitoring regime that should be in place to ensure that they and the people they come into contact with are safe.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly what is happening.</p>\n<p>And that is why the risk that is facing the average American -- even if they were to come into contact with somebody like Nurse Hickox -- is low.\xc2\xa0 And that is why our monitoring regime is tailored the way that it is.\xc2\xa0 So that the only way that that risk starts to rise if she starts to exhibit symptoms of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 And again, that goes to the way in which the Ebola virus is transmitted.</p>\n<p>So again, we have -- that\'s why we have protocols in place to monitor the health of health care workers when they return to the United States to do so closely, and to quickly isolate and treat them if there is a concern that they might be exhibiting symptoms of Ebola.</p>\n<p>Those kinds of risk assessments for a population that large is simply not feasible.\xc2\xa0 And that is -- that\'s just a fact based on the size of the military population that we\'re talking about.\xc2\xa0 And so there is obviously an efficiency gain that\'s associated with restricting the movements of those individuals and carefully and directly monitoring their health.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The day that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up real quick on this?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of course.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve said now a couple of times it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible or it would be very difficult for the military to follow up and do the personalized assessment on these people that you can do -- because of the numbers, the vast numbers.\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it also true that the military has far more knowledge about these people, about the people in the military than you do some random doctor appearing at an airport?\xc2\xa0 You have complete medical history on file for these people.\xc2\xa0 You know who they are, where they are, how to get in touch with them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They go back to base.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They go back to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- their military facilities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said there\xe2\x80\x99s all these bases, right, so even if there\xe2\x80\x99s 4,000 people -- if you take the maximum that are there -- they\'re going to back to dozens of bases, you divide 4,000 divided by a dozen, you might only a few dozen at each base, why is it so difficult to imagine that you could apply the same CDC-based, medical-based standards that you\'re doing in civilian at the military level?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t understand.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s essentially the Department of Defense that will render a verdict on this, right?\xc2\xa0 But I think what is beyond question is that it can be more efficiently done if the movements of these individuals are restricted, and they\'re limited to one area.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So efficiency -- as I originally posed the question to you -- is the overriding to do this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is obvious that it is more efficient to do it this way.\xc2\xa0 What is motivating this decision is something that will have to be explained to you by the people who are making this decision.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- this is a decision that the Secretary of Defense is still considering, and when he makes an announcement, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a rationale for why he believes this policy makes sense in a military context.</p>\n<p>The officials at CDC and HHS and governors in states across the country are responsible for figuring out what policy should be applied in a civilian context.\xc2\xa0 And for that, I can answer the motivation about these policies.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, it is wrong to suggest that applying the military policy would, in any way, make our civilian population more safe if it were implemented in the civilian context.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The day that Ron Klain was named I asked you a hypothetical question, and you took it and gave it an alternative answer.\xc2\xa0 I said, would Ron Klain be someone who if a school district shuttered its doors in an abundance of caution and the White House thought that was a bad idea, would he call?\xc2\xa0 You said, no, he would probably would get in touch with the relevant Cabinet agency and they would call.\xc2\xa0 Since you opened the door to that hypothetical and now we have a real situation, can you, in the name of transparency, explain to the country how Ron Klain\xe2\x80\x99s impact is being felt across the government?\xc2\xa0 Tell us that when New York and New Jersey adopted this policy that clearly the CDC thought was either questionable or perhaps rash, that Klain told Secretary Burwell, get in touch with the New Jersey health authorities and resolve this situation in a way that is closer to the CDC guidelines that are about to be released.\xc2\xa0 That seems like a completely logical implementation felt across the government process.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us that\'s what happened?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that officials at CDC and HHS and even here at the White House have been in regular touch with officials in New York and New Jersey.\xc2\xa0 And that was true before Ron Klain got here --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if Ron can\xe2\x80\x99t cut this Gordian Knot, what is he doing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I tried to describe that earlier to Jim.\xc2\xa0 So, again \xe2\x80\x93-</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But blandly and generically.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\'m not going to be in a position to do is detail all of the conversations that have taken place between New York and New Jersey officials and officials in the administration other than to say there have been a lot of them and they continue.</p>\n<p>Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you were describing Mr. Klain\xe2\x80\x99s activities, did you mean to suggest he\xe2\x80\x99s briefing the President daily?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I meant to suggest that he\xe2\x80\x99s briefing him regularly.\xc2\xa0 He did participate in the meeting that the President convened on Saturday -- I\'m sorry, on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether or not Ron had the opportunity to visit with the President on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 So I guess he\xe2\x80\x99s been here for seven days and he\xe2\x80\x99s seen the President for six of them, I guess is the way I would describe it \xe2\x80\x93 that I know of.\xc2\xa0 Maybe he saw him on Saturday, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he contributing to the PDB?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know how often this issue comes up in the PDB.\xc2\xa0 But if I did know I probably wouldn\'t talk about the details of the PDB in here anyway.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could pick at the thread that you declined to talk about much last week -- the union that represents citizenship and immigration service adjudicators has also questioned this purchase of green cards stock.\xc2\xa0 Could that have been done without White House direction?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Could that have been -- look, you should check with DHS.\xc2\xa0 I assume so.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t understand why the White House would have to weigh in on the purchase of paper.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s an expenditure and a fairly substantial one, apparently.\xc2\xa0 It\'s in the millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But again, I would be surprised, but I\'ve been surprised before, if the White House were involved in the purchasing of office supplies at the agency level.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some suggestion that this was purchased by virtue of the fact that the Senate has passed an immigration reform bill, the House could follow suit.\xc2\xa0 Is that feasible?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You should check with DHS for any questions you have about their purchase of office supplies and why and when they decided to make them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the White House did not direct it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Wendell, I would be surprised, as I mentioned earlier.\xc2\xa0 I can take the question if you\xe2\x80\x99d like, but I\'d be surprised if the White House were in a position where we were having intimate discussions with agency officials about the office supplies that they\xe2\x80\x99re purchasing.\xc2\xa0 It just seems unlikely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s a no, the White House did not direct this purchase?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Congressional Hispanic Caucus today endorsed Tom Perez for Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering both your reaction to that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely optimistic -- (laughter) -- but also I was wondering if the President has had any conversation with lawmakers as he\xe2\x80\x99s working through this decision.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that the President has consulted any members of Congress about the decision that lies ahead.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that Secretary Perez has distinguished himself as a particularly effective member of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Cabinet.\xc2\xa0 He did a tour at the Department of Justice prior to serving as Secretary of Labor.\xc2\xa0 He continues to do very good work there.\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to any sort of personnel announcements in the Department of Justice, I don\'t have anything for you at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last week, White House officials confirmed that the President had spoken to Kathy Ruemmler about the position.\xc2\xa0 Since that\'s a precedent that\'s been set, can you say if he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken to Tom Perez about this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 To be honest with you, I don\'t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s talked to him about it or not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on the Ruemmler decision to withdraw her name, do you know if part of the reason that she decided to do so was the controversy that was raised over The Washington Post report about her handling of the investigation into whether a member of the White House advance team -- or volunteer on the White House advance team was involved in some way with a prostitute during the trip to Colombia?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right, and the question is?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether that was an aspect of her decision or something that she or the President raised when they were discussing the job.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I haven\'t talked to her about the decision that she made in terms of her announcement, but I\'d be surprised if that contributed to it in any way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up if I could on my friend Bob\xe2\x80\x99s valiant attempt on these conversations that are going on, on the CDC guidelines.\xc2\xa0 And I know that you said that they\xe2\x80\x99re following the science and that\'s what\xe2\x80\x99s leading these policies.\xc2\xa0 Is there also guidance coming from the Justice Department about what steps are allowed to be taken when you try to quarantine somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s coming back?\xc2\xa0 In other words, could the CDC try to make a recommendation and the Justice Department raise concerns that perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutional?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that that instance has occurred. You could check with the Department of Defense about it.\xc2\xa0 But most of these governors are making decisions -- and I know that Governor Christie is in this category -- the decisions that he\xe2\x80\x99s making related to his state\xe2\x80\x99s quarantine laws are quarantine policies related to state law, not federal law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was talking about the -- I know you don\'t want to talk about the situation in New Jersey.\xc2\xa0 I get that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m only saying, more broadly.\xc2\xa0 Like yesterday we got additional guidance from the CDC, right, so they updated based on the best available science, on conditions on the ground.\xc2\xa0 Are there conversations happening with the Justice Department as these new guidelines are being discussed and implemented?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of, but you should check with the CDC on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other question I had.\xc2\xa0 Why are these governors\xe2\x80\x99 races so important to the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is a good question.\xc2\xa0 In many of these cases, we are finding that governors are playing a very important role in implementing federal law, and so whether it\'s raising the minimum wage, or expanding Medicaid, that there is an important role that governors are playing in furthering the kinds of policies that the President advocates.</p>\n<p>This also applies to voting rights, as well, that many governors do have an important role to play in states to protect the right of eligible citizens to participate in elections.\xc2\xa0 So the stakes are high in these governors\xe2\x80\x99 races, too.\xc2\xa0 And I recognize that this is a subset of the Washington press corps and so we\'re focused on the federal races, but the outcomes of these statewide campaigns are significant as well and are worthy of the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and in some cases they do have significant consequences for the successful implementation of policies that the President has worked very hard to pass.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More so than the outcome of the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s different.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the role of governors is quite different than the role of individual senators.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s hard to assess sort of whether or not one is more important than the other.\xc2\xa0 I think that they are significantly different.</p>\n<p>In the back, I\'ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on Mexico.\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of the latest crisis in human rights that is taking place in Mexico in the last few weeks, the disappearance of 43 students from the Guerrero? What does he think about it?\xc2\xa0 Does he share the idea that this situation is going out of the hands of the President of Mexico?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have not talked to the President about this.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not in a position to share any personal feelings that he may have on this matter.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, the reports of the situation are concerning.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the role for the United States government in the situation, I don\'t know of any.\xc2\xa0 But I\'d encourage you to check with the State Department who may be able to provide additional insight about any communications that may have occurred between the United States and the Pe\xc5\x88a Nieto administration on this matter.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:00 P.M.
