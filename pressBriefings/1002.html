Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t11:56 A.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s always good to see your faces.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Jay, how you doing?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good to see you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right back at you.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 I have -- I just want to make a brief announcement -- or not an announcement, just a reminder, because I know you all have seen this.\xc2\xa0 But today the White House announced Summer Jobs Plus, which is a new call to action for businesses, nonprofits and government to work together to provide pathways to employment for low-income and disconnected youth in the summer of 2012.\xc2\xa0 Already 32 organizations and four federal agencies have come together to commit to creating nearly 180,000 employment opportunities for low-income youth this summer, 70,000 of which are paid jobs or internships.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President proposed $1.5 billion, as I know you all know, for high-impact summer jobs and year-round employment for low-income youths ages 16-24 in the American Jobs Act as part of the Pathways Back to Work fund.\xc2\xa0 When Congress failed to act, the federal government and private sector came together to commit -- to make that commitment that was announced today.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has set a goal of reaching 250,000 employment opportunities by the start of summer, at least 100,000 of which will be placements in paid jobs and internships.\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement is well on the way to meeting that goal, and we thank the private sector participants in this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to all of our economic challenges is to do everything he can, working with Congress on the important things we can do and must do legislatively, working through his executive authority and working with the private sector, to keep all of the energy of his administration focused on creating jobs and growing the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I will begin with The Associated Press.\xc2\xa0 Ben Feller.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you first about the fallout from the recess appointments.\xc2\xa0 I understand the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position on why it did what it did, but in doing so, of course, you had to expect that the Republicans would not be happy -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously putting it mildly; the reaction was pretty fierce.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how you think this will affect any other issues that you might seek to work on with Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We will, as I just said, continue to work with Congress on the issues that we have to address together.\xc2\xa0 The President, any President, can\xe2\x80\x99t put 400,000 teachers back to work by himself.\xc2\xa0 He needs legislation, he needs Congress to cooperate and do the things that they have done in the past in a bipartisan way to put those folks back in the classroom or to put construction workers back on the job building our infrastructure or to do any of a number and a long list of things that can and should be done through Congress.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to working with Congress on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tI know you know, Ben, that this President is hardly the first to make a recess appointment.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he has made far fewer -- far fewer -- as President this far in his term than either of his two predecessors, and that would include President George W. Bush.\xc2\xa0 President Bush had made 61 recess appointments by this point in his term.\xc2\xa0 By contrast, President Obama has only recess appointed 32 individuals now, including the four yesterday -- 18 which -- of which, rather, have been confirmed since.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I certainly am aware of some of the reaction that you noted.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, the President firmly believes he has the constitutional authority to act as he did.\xc2\xa0 And they can make a lot of process arguments about it.\xc2\xa0 We feel very strongly that the Constitution and the legal case is strongly on our side.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut more importantly, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about process, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about whether or not Congress is in session.\xc2\xa0 And if I could digress for a minute, I think all of you should run up to Capitol Hill, check out the House and Senate and see if you can find a single member of Congress, and then tell me on this working day for most Americans whether or not Congress is in session.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what it\xe2\x80\x99s really about is the absolute urgency to install Richard Cordray as our consumer watchdog so that he can get to work today, as the CFPB has already announced, protecting middle-class Americans, protecting seniors from dishonest non-bank mortgage brokers, the kind who took advantage of that elderly couple the President met with yesterday in Cleveland, or to help students not get taken advantage of when they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with their student loans, or folks who deal with payday lenders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, we need -- average Americans need somebody representing their interests in Washington.\xc2\xa0 Lord knows that financial institutions have armies of lobbyists here, well paid, looking out for them.\xc2\xa0 The American people need Richard Cordray where he is now thanks to the action the President took yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can\xe2\x80\x99t you see how it seems a little incongruous to continue to say that the President looks forward to working with them at the same time that he gives statements that he did yesterday -- \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to take no for an answer, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to have -- let an ideological minority stop me\xe2\x80\x9d -- then the response from the Republicans about it\xe2\x80\x99s a power grab, he\xe2\x80\x99s arrogant.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily seem to lend itself to the next day, \xe2\x80\x9clook forward to work with them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that anybody expected or expects Washington to be a campfire where everybody holds hands together and sings Kumbaya.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what the nation\xe2\x80\x99s business is about.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the President made clear when he was running for this office, his number-one priority was to ensure that when he became President, Washington stopped ignoring some of the very difficult challenges that faced the country.\xc2\xa0 And he has taken many of those on, head on, and has put in place solutions to some of those very serious challenges we face.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd look, he has worked cooperatively with Congress from the moment he took the oath of office, and he will continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 But the case here is pretty stark.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans unfortunately in the Senate simply refused to allow Richard Cordray to have an up or down vote -- not for any reason that had to do with his qualifications.\xc2\xa0 Senator after senator -- Republican -- has said this is nothing about Richard Cordray; he\xe2\x80\x99s very qualified.\xc2\xa0 Republican attorneys general across the country have endorsed him.\xc2\xa0 In the cloture vote, he received a majority of the U.S. Senate.\xc2\xa0 But the Republicans filibustered.\xc2\xa0 Why?\xc2\xa0 Because they don\xe2\x80\x99t even want the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to be in operation.\xc2\xa0 They certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to have the powers that it has, by law, protecting American citizens from the kinds of practices that helped lead to the worst financial crisis and the worst recession since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf they want to change the law, they should -- going back to what we can do -- what they can do, legislatively -- they should try to pass a law to change it.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it is the law of the land, and it passed and it was signed into law by the President because he is absolutely committed to the Wall Street reform piece of this and to the reforms that could not be implemented fully until Richard Cordray was in office, as he is today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick campaign question for you.\xc2\xa0 From the campaign side of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s apparatus, I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d say, the focus continues to be on Mitt Romney.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, does the President look at this as an open Republican race right now, or does he look at this as Mitt Romney still leads?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I think I said yesterday in the gaggle on Air Force One, the President and I spoke briefly, just took note of the results from Iowa.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t make an assessment of what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen in the race or who he\xe2\x80\x99s going to run against.\xc2\xa0 I think he knows from experience, very personal experience, that primaries can play out in a variety of different and unexpected ways.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s focused right now, honestly, on his job.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a primary to worry about, and that affords him the luxury, if you will, but the importance of continuing to focus on what he can do as President to grow the economy and create jobs and, as you heard him today, to deal with our national security and our defense strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo just talking -- idle conversations in the hallways, I think we know pretty much what you know, because we get it from you guys in the press, about that process.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly interesting and we\xe2\x80\x99ll pay attention to it as folks on the sideline for now.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have an assessment at this point as to where it\xe2\x80\x99s going to head, and if I did know I might make a trip out to Vegas.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, on the Cordray recess appointment, what, if any, concern does the White House have that the likely legal challenges to his appointment may -- could undermine his ability to do his job, his legitimacy?\xc2\xa0 And how concerned at all is the President that the Republicans could retaliate by withholding or by resisting compromise on things like extending the payroll tax cuts for the full year, or perhaps even harden their opposition, their resistance to further nominations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the first point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to anticipate legal challenges that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen yet, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to assess them adequately since, as you know, I am not a lawyer.\xc2\xa0 I can only say that we feel very confident about the legal foundation upon which the President made this decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would just go back to what I said before about relations with Congress and the fact that we have important business to do.\xc2\xa0 And I would be surprised if Republicans wanted to argue that even though the chambers are empty, even though many members of Congress have described what they\xe2\x80\x99re on now as a recess, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s been made abundantly clear as a matter of public record that there is no intent for Congress to conduct any business until they return from this recess, all of which plays into our argument that they\xe2\x80\x99re in recess, in a sustained recess -- if they want to make that case and then, because they\xe2\x80\x99re mad about that, not extend the payroll tax cut for the American people, that would be a shocker.\xc2\xa0 I think that would be very unfortunate for the 160 million Americans who, just as was the case in December, for January 1st, could not afford and should not be saddled with what would be essentially a $1,000 tax hike over frustration or pique with the fact that this President acted because Congress wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t on a very important job -- the installation of a consumer watchdog whose sole responsibility, as I think you saw was announced today by the CFPB, is to make sure that average Americans are not taken advantage of by dishonest financial institutions.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a debate that we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to have, but if we were to have it I think we\xe2\x80\x99d be confident we would win it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are there any further recess appointments in the pipeline or was this just a one-day flurry?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make about appointments or nominations today.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move -- Chris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The New Hampshire legislature this month is expected to vote on a bill that would repeal the same-sex marriage law there.\xc2\xa0 The Democratic governor has said he\xe2\x80\x99d veto any such measure that came to his desk, but the Republicans have a super majority in the legislature and they could potentially have the votes to override this veto.\xc2\xa0 Both Rick Perry and Mitt Romney have said they support the repeal of the marriage law there, but what does the President hope is the outcome of this vote?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chris, I honestly haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about that state issue, so I would have to take the question and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything I can get back to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has said that he -- states should decide how to best address the marriage issue themselves.\xc2\xa0 If the legislature decides to repeal that marriage law will he support that decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s an \xe2\x80\x9cif-if\xe2\x80\x9d question and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the conversation with him or with any of the senior staff about it.\xc2\xa0 So let me take that and see if we can get a response to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Julie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Grassley says that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to write a letter to the Department of Justice asking if President Obama got a new opinion before appointing Cordray.\xc2\xa0 Did the White House talk to the Department of Justice?\xc2\xa0 And why won\xe2\x80\x99t they say whether they talked or not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I think I actually can say that we routinely consult with the Department of Justice on a range of legal matters, but we also routinely don\xe2\x80\x99t delve into the specifics of any confidential legal guidance that the President or the White House in general would receive in the course of those consultations.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s just standard operating procedure.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around.\xc2\xa0 Norah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, most Americans start the new year -- they start a new diet or a new exercise regime, or try and look at the new year as a fresh start.\xc2\xa0 And the President has --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Did you see my list?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 Start drinking less.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You found out this isn\xe2\x80\x99t water.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President chose to start the new year with an intentionally provocative action, something completely unprecedented, in appointing Richard Cordray.\xc2\xa0 Why would he choose to start the new year by angering Republicans on Capitol Hill?\xc2\xa0 Was this about politics?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He chose to start the new year with an action that is designed to take care of and protect average Americans who have to deal with these non-financial institutions, and because of the way the law was written, the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, could not implement and effectively oversee those non-bank financial institutions and therefore could not protect American citizens without having Richard Cordray in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as I just said, unfortunately Senate Republicans, as a matter of ideology and politics and just the sheer fact that they don\xe2\x80\x99t like Wall Street reform, I guess, or they don\xe2\x80\x99t want those protections in place for average Americans, refused to allow an up or down vote on somebody who is broadly acknowledged to be enormously qualified for the job, has broad bipartisan support across the country, and who even among those very Republicans who filibustered his nomination is viewed as qualified for the post.\xc2\xa0 They just don\xe2\x80\x99t want the post to exist in the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s written into the law.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he took action because Congress wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t on something that -- because every day we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a consumer watchdog, every day Richard Cordray was out there waiting for, or hoping for, congressional Republicans or Senate Republicans to choose protecting average Americans over Wall Street and financial institutions and their lobbyists was a day when those Americans were not protected.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why he acted.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a deliberately provocative thing.\xc2\xa0 It was a deliberately decisive move to ensure that those protections could be in place and be implemented.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the President now prepared for the reaction in terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s coming from Republicans?\xc2\xa0 I spoke with some yesterday who said that they have been working with the President; they approved all but two of his judicial nominees, they\xe2\x80\x99ve approved a number of executive appointments, and that quote, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very tough to do now.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 They view this as provocative.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 President Obama has 74 nominees currently pending on the Senate floor.\xc2\xa0 By contrast, at this time in 2003, President Bush had only 42 nominees pending on the floor.\xc2\xa0 President Obama currently has a total of 181 nominees pending before the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Those nominees have been pending before the Senate for an average of 165 days, or almost five and a half months.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo while they certainly have approved a handful or some nominees, and there have been -- there has been -- there have been ebbs and flows in that process, the fact of the matter is we\xe2\x80\x99ve had an unprecedented level of obstruction when it comes to the confirmation, often confirmation of routine appointments and nominations.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I take issue with that supposition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would just say -- look, the President looks forward to working with Congress, with Republicans in Congress as well as Democrats, on the very important challenges that face the country, and the challenges that -- for which the solutions require congressional action.\xc2\xa0 And he -- going back to an earlier question -- he certainly expects that the Congress will extend the payroll tax cut, extend unemployment insurance; that they will do that without drama because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a tax cut for 160 million Americans, the kind of thing that Republicans, at least in theory, are supposed to be for.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we expect that the President will be able to and will work to cooperate with Congress on a number of areas.\xc2\xa0 And as I said earlier this week, we actually are fairly hopeful about the prospect of greater cooperation.\xc2\xa0 Because not just the President is running for reelection, but all of the House and a third of the Senate, and everybody has to answer to their constituents.\xc2\xa0 And I think constituents to members of Congress are going to want to know what their elected representatives did, and what actions they took, beyond obstruction, to help the economy grow and create jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then can I get your reaction on the appointments to the National Labor Relations Board?\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney said today that the President has now packed it with \xe2\x80\x9cunion stooges.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And he said that the board\xe2\x80\x99s actions are simply un-American, and what the President did was political payback for the unions helping him with his campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would make two points.\xc2\xa0 First of all, there were three nominees.\xc2\xa0 One of them was a Republican who\xe2\x80\x99s been languishing; hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even gotten a committee vote for a year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, I find it a little rich that on this and on the appointment of Richard Cordray to be the nation\xe2\x80\x99s consumer watchdog, that the former governor of Massachusetts decided to take a position, in both cases, against the security and protection of working and middle-class Americans, because -- the President made those recess appointments to the NLRB because the NLRB did not have enough members anymore to function.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s an agency, an independent agency, that is designed to protect workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President thinks that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 He thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s important to protect workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights.\xc2\xa0 He thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s important, in the case of the CFPB and Richard Cordray, to protect consumers from the abuses of payday lenders or mortgage -- non-bank mortgage brokers or student loan organizations or businesses.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s my comment on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tKen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in the new defense cuts, the strategic review, one of the areas to escape the axe is the East Asia Pacific region.\xc2\xa0 Is there a way that the -- how should China perceive that?\xc2\xa0 Is this being done largely with China in mind?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent question.\xc2\xa0 As you heard the President make clear during his Asia trip -- APEC, East Asia Summit -- in November, the President is committed to rebalancing our focus, both in our national security and defense strategies, on Asia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s position as a candidate as well as since he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office was that for -- because of the intense focus on Iraq, principally, as well as the Middle East in general, that followed 9/11, we had as a nation not been paying enough attention to Asia.\xc2\xa0 And that is broadly the case and broadly the President\xe2\x80\x99s view with regard to economics, diplomacy, as well as foreign policy and national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he made clear that in this defense strategy review, that he insisted on it and he was deeply engaged in it and met with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, as well as the combatant commanders, because he wanted a strategy to drive the choices that were made around the budget, not the other way around; not because there were budget cuts passed into law by the Budget Control Act, voted on in a bipartisan way, that that number shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t drive our defense strategy, but a strategy should then be developed that was best for the country, best for our future, and that the -- and then the budget would address that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo his commitment to, as you said, sort of maintaining our presence and even heightening it in Asia is part of that overall rebalancing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, and then Jessica.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on -- okay, thank you -- what message then might this send to North Korea?\xc2\xa0 And is there any concern that this new focus on Asia might be provoking in any way this new untested leader?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then domestically on the same issue, defense companies are talking about losing hundreds of jobs, potentially thousands as a result of these defense cuts.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As regards North Korea and the change in leadership there, I mean, obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s a recent development and the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus on Asia and his goal of rebalancing our strategic view towards Asia long predates that, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no relation there.\xc2\xa0 And our position on North Korea remains as it was.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the issue of budget cuts, these are the product of a bipartisan bill, the Budget Control Act that was passed, as you know, in August.\xc2\xa0 And the fact of the matter is that after 9/11, for good reason, our defense budget increased rather dramatically and for a sustained period of time.\xc2\xa0 And over the past three years our defense budget has been increasing.\xc2\xa0 So we are making sensible choices that reflect our need to get our fiscal house in order, and we are making those choices driven by a strategy rather than just giving the Defense Department an across-the-board haircut, because that would be irresponsible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re eliminating old Cold War programs to ensure that we can enhance our investment in intelligence, reconnaissance and other areas that are more suited for modern-day defense strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that there are difficult choices involved in this, but the fact of the matter is that even with these cuts our budget, defense budget, will be substantial and larger even than it was towards the end of the Bush administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Jessica.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You touched on this in the gaggle yesterday, but I wanted to just press you a little further.\xc2\xa0 Quoting some of the things the President said as senator when he opposed John Bolton\xe2\x80\x99s recess appointment, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong thing to do,\xe2\x80\x9d and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis process means we\xe2\x80\x99ll have less credibility and, ironically, be less equipped, in this case, to reform the United Nations.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, I know in the gaggle you said that was -- you posed it because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t like John Bolton\xe2\x80\x99s policies.\xc2\xa0 But in this case he likes Cordray\xe2\x80\x99s policies.\xc2\xa0 How does this go to the substance of the matter, which is the recess appointment itself?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, the point I was making -- again, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve cited the statistics on recess appointments, which is a constitutional authority allowed to every President and which has been exercised by this President\xe2\x80\x99s predecessors in far greater degree.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, the distinction here is that, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve noted, Richard Cordray has broad bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 There is no question about his qualifications for this job.\xc2\xa0 In the case of Mr. Bolton there were a great many questions about his qualifications for the job, and a great deal of opposition to his nomination on the merits, on his qualifications, and that makes this quite different.\xc2\xa0 This is an effort to deny Richard Cordray the opportunity to serve in this position because of opposition to the position itself and opposition to Wall Street reform, not because of opposition to this nominee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact is CFPB exists because it is the law.\xc2\xa0 The position exists because it is the law.\xc2\xa0 It was passed by the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 It was signed into law by the President.\xc2\xa0 If Republicans want to change that they can do it legislatively, or they can try to.\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s consumers deserve to have this consumer watchdog in place, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President acted as he did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A broader question about some of the executive muscle he\xe2\x80\x99s been flexing lately.\xc2\xa0 When he was a candidate in 2008, he railed against the executive powers that the Bush-Cheney White House had expanded, but now he is, as I said, flexing a lot of executive muscle.\xc2\xa0 Has he flip-flopped on that position, or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there are apples and oranges here in terms of the use and extent of executive authority.\xc2\xa0 I would simply point to the stats I just gave you about recess appointments, which is a well-established tradition and authority granted by the Constitution to Presidents of the United States, an authority that this President has used discriminatingly by comparison to President Bush, for example.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd going back to -- this is not an either/or proposition.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t decide to simply act with your executive authority and not act with Congress because this President is committed to doing everything he can within his power to help the American people, to grow the economy and to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s his number-one priority.\xc2\xa0 And that includes working with Congress, because on so many of these important issues Congress has to be part of the solution, has to be part of the effort to cooperate --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did gridlock in Congress change his opinion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have certainly experienced gridlock on some issues and we\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced a great deal of obstruction on the Richard Cordray nomination and other issues.\xc2\xa0 But he exercises his executive authority I think in a very judicious manner.\xc2\xa0 And as you and others have often pointed out, some of the things that he is able to do through his executive authority as regards -- as relates to jobs and the economy are sometimes very small in their impact, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they\xe2\x80\x99re not worth doing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact is he will do things, small, medium and large, that he can do through his executive authority, that he can do working with the private sector, as he did today -- or as the White House did today with the Summer Jobs Plus program -- and then he will continue to press the Congress to take action on the American Jobs Act and to take action broadly on jobs and the economy, through the payroll tax cut extension, through the extension of unemployment insurance, through the absolute urgent need to do something about our infrastructure as a long-term economic growth matter and also as a way of putting idle construction workers back to work.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that should be a goal that we all share, and traditionally, Republicans and Democrats have shared and have acted on.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, we remain hopeful that we can work with Congress, that we will work with Congress, and that that cooperation would be driven by the demands of the American people and the constituents, those folks who sent members to Congress and sent the President to the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jay, speaking of jobs, tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s jobs numbers -- I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not in the predictions business, but can you talk about the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll throw it out there.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to Vegas you may as well do that, too.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the hopes and the expectations, and specifically about the first jobs numbers of the year and how they might set the tone for what the President is going to speak about in the State of the Union speech and also what he says on the campaign trail in the months ahead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare to go there.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because it would sound like a prediction and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have one.\xc2\xa0 So we look at these things as -- and our economists look at these things as sort of longer-term trends.\xc2\xa0 One number is not decisive, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s good or bad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we are focused on -- we can\xe2\x80\x99t control data, right?\xc2\xa0 What we are focused on is what we can do to help grow the economy, to help create jobs, so that that unemployment number comes down, so that the job creation number goes up, so that the growth number goes up.\xc2\xa0 But we can\xe2\x80\x99t spend a lot of time worrying about what those numbers are going to be because we don\xe2\x80\x99t control that directly.\xc2\xa0 We can only do what we can do.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why this President is so focused on doing everything he can, from Summer Jobs Plus programs, to helping folks with their mortgages, to putting people back to work through the American Jobs Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up with a couple logistical questions?\xc2\xa0 A, are we going to hear from the President on the jobs numbers tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to hear from --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a scheduling announcement to make.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other question is, the President has talked about wanting to get right to work on extending the payroll tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 Are there negotiations already underway on getting the full year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specifics for you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that there are conversations being had, but beyond that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we certainly look forward to that action being taken as soon as possible to ensure that there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt in the minds of the American people who would be affected by the failure to extend the payroll tax cut that the extension will happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But nothing involving the White House right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details on that, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tEd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on recess appointments, earlier you said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody expects Washington to be a campfire where everyone sits around and sings Kumbaya.\xc2\xa0 What about hope and change?\xc2\xa0 I thought there was an expectation -- the President said that if he got elected, maybe it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be singing around a campfire but the situation would improve.\xc2\xa0 Has he just given up on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that, in some ways, I answered your question before I got it, which is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s promise was not just to change atmospherics but to change the way Washington did business and to change it by working together collaboratively with Congress and others in Washington to get people here to focus on challenges that they had ignored for too long -- that we had ignored for too long.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that included the need for Wall Street reform; the need for health care reform, a project 100 years in the making that had experienced numerous efforts and failures; the need to deal with our energy policy to get it focused on \xe2\x80\x9call of the above\xe2\x80\x9d approach in terms of our energy sources, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to ensure that we were competitive in the 21st century in clean energy industries and doing things that helped our environment as well as helped our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he has done these.\xc2\xa0 Saving the automobile industry, and because of the crisis brought on in the automobile industry by the devastating recession, insisting at great political peril, as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you all reported on at the time, that we need to have a vibrant, thriving American automobile industry.\xc2\xa0 He was not willing to write it off, but in exchange for taxpayer assistance, insisting that those companies reform themselves and make themselves more competitive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xc2\xa0 And he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it alone.\xc2\xa0 He did it with Congress in almost all cases.\xc2\xa0 So it is true that partisanship prevails still and the tone is not what you would hope.\xc2\xa0 But the important thing here for the American people is that we change the way we do business, that we address the challenges that had loomed like elephants in the room that everybody ignored for too long.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what this President has done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when you say \xe2\x80\x9cchange the way you do business,\xe2\x80\x9d on the substance of how recess appointments go forward, you guys cite all kinds of legal precedent --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Including Bush administration -- Bush arguments right?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- we quoted and others quoted yesterday saying that you had the constitutional power to do this.\xc2\xa0 Nevertheless, when you say now they\xe2\x80\x99re in recess, they\xe2\x80\x99re not working -- Democrats, like Harry Reid, as recently as 2008, when George W. Bush was in office, agreed with the Bush White House -- which he was not friendly with -- that when they\xe2\x80\x99re in pro forma session, then in fact they\xe2\x80\x99re not in recess.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re open for business.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not doing a lot, but there was an agreement that President Bush would not do -- he did plenty of recess appointments.\xc2\xa0 But when they were in pro forma session, he did not.\xc2\xa0 He accepted that precedent.\xc2\xa0 And Harry Reid as recently as 2008 was saying this.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t take advantage of, or he didn\xe2\x80\x99t act on the legal opinion of his own OLC and others who actually argued the opposite.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After they left the Bush administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But look, I think their opinions are quite clear.\xc2\xa0 And I think you reported one of them in your piece.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was not an official position of the Bush administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our legal standing here we are very confident on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And on the absolute need to ensure that the CFPB has its full authority and its powers to protect Americans, middle-class consumers, from dishonest non-financial institutions, we\xe2\x80\x99re very comfortable with that and the need to act.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 People agree.\xc2\xa0 But there was -- when we talk about Kumbaya and all this, Harry Reid -- who didn\xe2\x80\x99t like George W. Bush, called him a liar, all kinds of other things -- agreed that when -- that this was in place and that he would not do these recess appointments.\xc2\xa0 And President Bush didn\xe2\x80\x99t defy that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo how are you improving this tone that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about when you\xe2\x80\x99re changing that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s agreement that was in effect just three --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about process here.\xc2\xa0 On the one hand --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Process matters, because --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the one hand, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about whether -- I mean, I defy you to find anything like a quorum, anything like even enough people to fill this room up on Capitol Hill who are elected members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 You might find them in very warm places or snowy places having fundraisers.\xc2\xa0 But you won\xe2\x80\x99t find them in Capitol Hill because they are in recess.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for a process that has proven itself to be broken to fix itself.\xc2\xa0 And with regards to the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority, which you\xe2\x80\x99ve said he has, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to exercise it.\xc2\xa0 Because we have to have Richard Cordray in place in order to protect American consumers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the argument against that is either -- on the other side is either a process argument, or, more truthfully, is an argument about the fact that they don\xe2\x80\x99t even want the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and they want to weaken it or water it down or eliminate it because they seem to believe that after all we went through in 2007 and 2008, the unbelievable harm that the financial crisis caused to this economy and to the American people, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need new rules; Wall Street should go back to the way it was; the financial institutions should be -- should regulate themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThey can take that on the road and try and sell it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are going to be many buyers.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But last thing on that point -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that several times in this briefing and other places -- that basically Republicans just want to do away with -- they don\xe2\x80\x99t have problems with Richard Cordray as a man, they think --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just quoting them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve said that, it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely true.\xc2\xa0 However, Republicans do have a substantive point they make on this that you\xe2\x80\x99re not mentioning, which is that he has an office with $500 million, and they think that it\xe2\x80\x99s unaccountable and that there should be oversight of that so he\xe2\x80\x99s not just going after businesses.\xc2\xa0 Do you at least agree that there should be some safeguards in place -- there should be consumer protections -- but there should also be protections to make sure he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have $500 million in a fishing expedition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But Ed, as you know, the kind of oversight that exists for the CFPB is no different than as exists for other independent agencies, by and large.\xc2\xa0 It is part of the law that was passed and signed into law by the President, and if they want to introduce changes to the structure or oversight of the CFPB through legislation they should do that.\xc2\xa0 But they should not block a highly qualified nominee for a job that exists in law out of ideological pique, because it\xe2\x80\x99s hurting the American people and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not doing them any good, I think, politically.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s just my advice.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the President were to go ahead -- were planning to go ahead with a controversial recess appointment, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he just appoint the person who invented the office to begin with -- Elizabeth Warren?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a golden oldie.\xc2\xa0 I think she\xe2\x80\x99s running for Senate.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be running for Senate if the President had made a recess appointment.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think, look, we have enormous regard for Elizabeth Warren.\xc2\xa0 She did a terrific job in setting up this agency.\xc2\xa0 Richard Cordray is, as she herself has said, the right man for the job, the right person for the job, and enormously qualified.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned at the top, she\xe2\x80\x99s I think engaged in a campaign of her own right now.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you guys give her a heads up that you were going to do the recess appointment for Cordray?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t give her the courtesy call that you were recess appointing someone else?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s running for Senate, Hans.\xc2\xa0 A courtesy call?\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, she just said this agency was her baby.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hans, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more question.\xc2\xa0 There seems to be some legal question whether Richard Cordray can be paid, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a recess appointment.\xc2\xa0 Do you know whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99ll actually be paid?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I assume, as with other recess appointments, he has all the -- everything that comes with it.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific answer to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And you made the shocking allegation that there were fundraisers in warm and snowy places going on around the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just guessing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the implication that just because Congress isn\xe2\x80\x99t here in session that they\xe2\x80\x99re not working?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Only in Washington would not being in the office, not even being in the town where your office exists, qualify as being on the job.\xc2\xa0 I mean, Congress -- if Congress is in session they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be somewhere, like, close to the capital.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, look, train your cameras on the chambers.\xc2\xa0 See if you can find any folks there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t let our cameras in, but I take your point.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wonder why.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tLaura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 You spoke at length about the fact that the frustration that Richard --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that long.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Richard Cordray -- over the course of two days -- that Richard Cordray was being bottled up and held up by the Senate, unwilling to approve his -- even vote on his nomination.\xc2\xa0 Two of the three NLRB nominees were just put forth last month, just a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 The Senate hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had time to act on that.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the justification for a recess appointment for them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we need the agency to function so that workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights continue to be protected.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an independent agency that cannot function without a certain number of board members, one.\xc2\xa0 Two, any doubt about the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s intention, or the Republicans in the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s intention of allowing any nominee to come forward can be -- was demonstrated by the fact that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even allow the Republican nominee to get to a committee vote so -- who had been there for almost a year.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President acted because Congress wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and it was clear that Congress wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- and numerous senators have made clear they won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And we have to have that -- these independent agencies exist for a reason, and the President believed that it was essential to make sure that that agency could function.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I have two follow-ups to that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, if it\xe2\x80\x99s so critical for the agency to function -- everybody knew when those vacancies were coming -- why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President nominate somebody earlier so the Senate would have time to confirm them in a -- should they be so inclined, in a timely fashion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he was hoping that the Senate would confirm the Republican who had been up there for a long time.\xc2\xa0 There was I think a Democrat who was recess appointed who was -- they refused to confirm in the past.\xc2\xa0 So, again, the Senate Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 disposition towards this could not have been more clear and their intentions could not have been more clear.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact is, it was simply a matter of the agency could not act and function without having the requisite number of board members.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the standard for the Senate bottling somebody up is now statements by senators about their intentions, whether they plan or don\xe2\x80\x99t plan to move on a --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, you know how Congress works.\xc2\xa0 Maybe there should be a day where, for example, with the filibusters, senators actually have to hang around and filibuster -- properly act out the verb, right?\xc2\xa0 But instead, all they have to do is, like, tug on their ear and suddenly a vote goes down.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, unfortunately, that\xe2\x80\x99s how it works.\xc2\xa0 So we -- Laura, we could have a -- I think at the -- out of deference to your colleagues, we can have this esoteric conversation later.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President, I think with clear justification, believed that he had to do this in order to ensure that this independent agency could function.</p>\n<p>\n\tToshi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Next week, Treasury Secretary Geithner will go to Japan and China.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to ask about the details, but can you give us a sense of general expectation by Japan administration on his visit and on potential deliverables?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about deliverables.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is part of his responsibilities as Treasury Secretary.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s been to China since last spring.\xc2\xa0 I could be wrong about that, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s roughly that.\xc2\xa0 And this is part of our engagement with Asia that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about already, and in the case of Japan, an important ally.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details on it.\xc2\xa0 Maybe Treasury does.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re approaching the one-year anniversary of the Gabby Giffords shooting.\xc2\xa0 And she\xe2\x80\x99s of course going to do things this weekend and mark it in a certain way.\xc2\xa0 And when the President spoke and gave that really moving -- by a lot of accounts -- speech, he talked about taking steps on gun safety and gun control in the months ahead.\xc2\xa0 Does he have plans of actually following through on that a year later?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we -- did we publish that?\xc2\xa0 I think we have put forward some positions on this, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new for you on it.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on the anniversary itself.\xc2\xa0 It obviously was a -- I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a solemn occasion given that -- I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable recovery that Congresswoman Giffords has made, but we can never forget the lives lost on that day.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, under the President\xe2\x80\x99s defense initiative that he announced today, will the United States still have the ability or not have the ability to fight and win two major wars at the same time in different places?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe Secretary Panetta, following the President, spoke at length about the broader defense strategy and the -- what underlies it.\xc2\xa0 So I would point you to his remarks for a better assessment of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said we can do -- the United States would be able to do more than one thing at a time.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s without question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess the question is, does that include fighting and winning two major wars at the same time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, what I can say is, again, you should -- I think there is ample comment on this from the Secretary of Defense about what the strategy is and what it allows our military forces to achieve.\xc2\xa0 What is true is that we are at the end of a decade of war.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJust when this President took office we had 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we\xe2\x80\x99re now down to half that, and the President is, as you know, as part of his Afghanistan strategy, committed to further drawing down Afghan forces gradually.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that creates opportunities and allows us to rebalance our defense strategy.\xc2\xa0 But for details about how that is underpinned, if you will, I would point you to the Secretary of Defense.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you guys willing to acknowledge that you\xe2\x80\x99re working with Yusuf Qaradawi on the peace talks with the Taliban?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark, I feel like I owe you one.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been raising your hand for a bit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Based on White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s legal analysis, if the Senate had come into pro forma session every day instead of every three or four days, would that have made a difference?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will leave it to the lawyers to analyze it or to provide further detail for you on it.\xc2\xa0 Our assessment is that Congress has been in recess and has made every indication that it will be in recess for a sustained period of time, and that gaveling in and gaveling out for seven seconds does not constitute a recess with regard to the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, let\xe2\x80\x99s take the other -- I guess going to maybe Laura\xe2\x80\x99s question or somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s -- the other side of the extreme here, which is that if these gimmicks were all a Senate needed -- the Senate needed to do to prevent the President from exercising his constitutional authority -- any President -- then no Senate would -- I mean, no President would ever be able to exercise it because --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in the last two years, the Bush administration --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, but -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re saying that this is a gimmick versus a constitutionally enshrined authority.\xc2\xa0 And we feel very comfortable, as a legal matter, that the Constitution trumps gimmicks.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has the White House made a decision on when to notify Congress about the debt limit and to start the 15-day clock rolling on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing new for you on that.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:45 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
