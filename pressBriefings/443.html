Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:17 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I hope you all had a pleasant weekend, maybe even found a little air-conditioning. Let me do a little thing at the top, Julie, and then we\'ll get to your questions.</p>\n<p>This week, the President will continue to discuss his plans to build on the progress our economy is making by creating jobs and expanding opportunity for all hardworking Americans with a focus on the importance of investing in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 The President has been clear that we need to do more to improve our infrastructure in order to create jobs, provide certainty to states and communities, help American businesses and grow our economy, and he\xe2\x80\x99s put forth a proposal that would do just that and pay for it by closing unfair tax loopholes and making common-sense reforms to our business tax system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He\xe2\x80\x99s acted on his own, using his executive authority, including speeding up permitting for priority projects to create more jobs.\xc2\xa0 And the President will announce new executive actions on infrastructure this week.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the President has been pressing Congress to act to avoid a lapse in funding of the Highway Trust Fund, which will go insolvent as early as August, putting numerous active projects at risk.\xc2\xa0 This week Congress will consider a solution to avoid that scenario, and the President will continue to urge Republican lawmakers to not block it.</p>\n<p>This morning we released a new report from the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council on the long-term economic benefits of transportation investment and why conditions in the infrastructure sector are ripe for innovation, with new technologies and approaches promising significant gains in productivity, efficiency and resilience.\xc2\xa0 We also released an interactive transportation map that allows Americans across the country to learn more about the condition of their state\xe2\x80\x99s roads and bridges, as well as how many jobs -- nearly 700,000 across the nation -- and active highway and transit projects would be jeopardized if Congress fails to pass a new transportation bill before the current one expires.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President will continue to highlight the importance of investing in our infrastructure throughout the week.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow he will visit the Turner Fairbank Highway Research Center in McLean, Virginia, a leading facility testing new technologies for highway transportation innovations.\xc2\xa0 And then on Thursday, he will visit an infrastructure site in Delaware where he will announce a new initiative, using his pen and his phone, to increase private sector investment in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Investing in infrastructure keeps the economy moving, spurs innovation and bolsters our national competitiveness.\xc2\xa0 This is a key part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Year of Action plan and he looks forward to continuing to call for Congress and all partners to work with us on short-term and long-term solutions.</p>\n<p>So with that long windup, Julie, you want to get us started?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to start with the Iran nuclear talks.\xc2\xa0 Kerry obviously is in Vienna, and it appears as though the foreign ministers meetings over the weekend haven\'t really yielded that much of a breakthrough.\xc2\xa0 Given that this deadline is approaching so quickly, I wonder if Kerry is in Vienna with any sort of okay from the President to pursue an extension of the interim agreement, or if his mandate is to simply finalize a deal by July 20th or leave with nothing.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\'s important to understand where we\'ve come from here.\xc2\xa0 Our negotiating team has been working around the clock in Vienna for a couple of weeks in this latest round of negotiations and participating in a mix of plenary sessions, experts meetings, bilateral meetings with other countries including Iran, and coordination sessions that have been chaired by the EU.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, Secretary Kerry traveled there just over this weekend to assess Iran\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to make the critical choices it will need to make if we have a chance of getting a comprehensive agreement and to see if progress can be made on the issues where significant gaps remain between the P5-plus-1 and Iran.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary has had two meetings with Iran Foreign Minister Zarif thus far.\xc2\xa0 After he concludes his trip, the Secretary will make some recommendations to the President regarding next steps.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s important to recognize that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some important progress in this round.\xc2\xa0 Iran has come to these talks in a serious matter -- in a serious manner, I should say, and to its credit, Iran has defied the expectations of some by actually fulfilling the obligations under the Joint Plan of Action.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that that Joint Plan of Action was predicated on Iran taking some steps to roll back their nuclear program in exchange for some limited relief of the sanctions regime that\xe2\x80\x99s been imposed.\xc2\xa0 The Iranians have also engaged in the comprehensive negotiations in a serious way and demonstrated some flexibility in the context of that negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But on some key issues so far Iran has yet to be able to make the decisions that are necessary to prove to the world that their nuclear program is exclusively peaceful.\xc2\xa0 That ultimately is where the significant gaps remain.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Secretary Kerry is there to, again, assess the seriousness with which the Iranians are pursuing these negotiations and will return to make a recommendation to the President about the way forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know when you expect that recommendation from Kerry?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like he is going to be there too much longer.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific timeline in terms of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s travel, but, yes, I would not anticipate him there -- remaining there through the week or anything.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any plans for Kerry to go to the Middle East to work on a possible cease-fire?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, obviously we have been engaged at a variety of levels in this government with both the Israelis and Palestinians to try to resolve the ongoing violence there.\xc2\xa0 We are seeking a de-escalation in that violence, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling announcements to make as it relates to the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s travel but I know that senior State Department officials and even the President as recently as last Thursday was in touch with senior Israeli officials on this matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just ask on other topic.\xc2\xa0 John Cornyn and Henry Cuellar say that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be introducing legislation tomorrow aimed at addressing the situation on the border.\xc2\xa0 And it appears as though, at least from the outline that they\xe2\x80\x99ve sent out, that it meets a lot of the conditions that the President has called for.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House has been in touch with those lawmakers, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this legislation and, if so, whether you would support it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to announce whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99d support that legislation at this point.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll wait until it\xe2\x80\x99s introduced and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll review the draft.\xc2\xa0 I know that senior White House officials have been in touch with a number of lawmakers and members of their staffs on Capitol Hill over the last couple of weeks that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been dealing with this issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any specific conversations between Senator Cornyn and the White House or Congressman Cuellar and the White House.\xc2\xa0 But our views on this topic are pretty well known; what we have communicated publicly is in line with what we\xe2\x80\x99ve communicated privately on this.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly review their legislation when they introduce it, including as early as tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we certainly welcome constructive engagement from Republicans.\xc2\xa0 After all, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of talk from Republicans about how urgent and pressing this situation is, but not a lot of action when it comes to acting on a proposal the President has now put forward -- a detailed proposal that the President put forward eight days ago now.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the supplemental request has been running into quite a bit of opposition on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 What are your options if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your Plan B?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right now we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on Plan A.\xc2\xa0 Again, Plan A is something that Republicans themselves have advocated for, right -- pressing this administration to mobilize resources to meet this urgent humanitarian need and enforce the law.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to do, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what these additional resources would allow us to do more effectively.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re focused right now on getting Plan A done.\xc2\xa0 Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only thing we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 The President has already used some of his own executive authority to direct some resources from the interior to be focused on the border region.\xc2\xa0 That has improved our ability to deal with this significant flow through our immigration court system that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last few weeks.\xc2\xa0 So there are some steps that we can take on our own, but additional resources are needed, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that Congress will act soon to allow the administration to access them and deploy them in pursuit of mitigating this significant humanitarian situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Feinstein says a change in regulation, not a change in the 2008 law, could speed the return home of some of the children.\xc2\xa0 Is that your feeling as well?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly consistent with what we\xe2\x80\x99ve advocated for.\xc2\xa0 In answering this question a couple of times, what I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to articulate is what our ultimate goal here is. Some people have asked should we change the 2008 law, or should we just change the ability of the Secretary of Homeland Security or some other law enforcement official to enforce that law in a slightly different way.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, what we are looking to do is get greater authority to more efficiently enforce this law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That means we would balance the legitimate humanitarian needs of those individuals who are apprehended along the border. We certainly would ensure that they receive the due process to which they are entitled, but once that due process has run its course, if it\xe2\x80\x99s found that those individuals do not have a legal basis for remaining in the country, we would like the Secretary of Homeland Security to be able to exercise the discretion necessary to repatriate that individual or those individuals.</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s the ultimate outcome that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see.\xc2\xa0 Whether it means rewriting the 2008 law or just writing a new law that would give greater authority and discretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security, the details in this are important, but either of those approaches could work if they are tailored with this goal in mind.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Stephen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you said that Israel has the right to defend itself, but does the administration believe that, given its capacity to fend off attacks with the Iron Dome and the density of population in Gaza, which makes civilian casualties inevitable, that it\xe2\x80\x99s using appropriate force in this conflict, or does there come a point where it steps over the line?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have made clear, Stephen, is that no country can accept rocket fire aimed at civilians, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that we support Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to defend itself.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, the Iron Dome system that the United States has worked with Israel to set up to protect Israeli citizens has been effective.\xc2\xa0 Well, I should say it\xe2\x80\x99s been effective in protecting many of the civilians that are in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way on the Israeli side of the border, but it is not designed to ultimately bring those rocket attacks to an end.\xc2\xa0 And that is what is really important.</p>\n<p>We need Hamas to stop launching rockets that are putting Israeli citizens in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, at the same time, the United States is also very concerned about those Palestinian civilians who are in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve been urging Israeli political leaders and Palestinian leaders to do everything necessary to try to safeguard the safety and well-being of civilians on both sides of the border.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have said that nobody wants to see a ground invasion because that would put even more civilians at risk.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, again, this is Israel\xe2\x80\x99s decision to make, and Israeli political leaders certainly have the right -- even the responsibility -- to protect their citizens, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99ll do.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify this?\xc2\xa0 You said either approach could work, either rewriting the 2008 law, or writing a new law. It sounds like what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is that legislative action is necessary for you to be able to send these kids home quicker.\xc2\xa0 In other words, you can\xe2\x80\x99t do it with your executive authority alone, Congress has to pass something.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at the risk of getting too far into the weeds here, what I was trying to say is that the details are important.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lead you to suggest that we don\xe2\x80\x99t really care about the details.\xc2\xa0 We do care about the details, but ultimately in pursuit of this goal, which is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the same, Mexico and Central America?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, which is to balance these competing equities, which is to meet the basic humanitarian needs of the individuals who are apprehended along the border, to ensure that they receive the due process to which they\xe2\x80\x99re entitled, but also to enforce the law as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but that\'s something you cannot do with your executive authority alone?\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that there are some aspects of that that we are able to do with our executive authority alone.\xc2\xa0 That is why, for example, the President has acted using his executive authority to deploy additional resources that are part of the immigration court system.\xc2\xa0 That would allow us to process that backlog more quickly and would meet all of those goals.</p>\n<p>What we are seeking are a couple of things:\xc2\xa0 resources that would allow us to increase the number of personnel that are devoted to that effort.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re also seeking is additional authority that can be vested with the Secretary of Homeland Security so he can exercise his discretion and look for ways to more efficiently enforce the law -- that is to repatriate those individuals who the immigration courts have decided do not have a legal basis for remaining the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that you\xe2\x80\x99ve reduced significantly the flow through the immigration ports already.\xc2\xa0 You mean reduced them or accelerated it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t remember saying exactly that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said he\xe2\x80\x99s moved -- he\xe2\x80\x99s used his authority to move resources from the interior to the border and that has reduced significantly the flow through the immigration ports.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying -- thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify if that is, in fact, what I said.\xc2\xa0 What those resources have done is they have helped address the problem that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing.\xc2\xa0 What we have seen is a spike in individuals who are attempting to come across the southwest border.\xc2\xa0 That has led to a backlog in our immigration court system.\xc2\xa0 By deploying additional resources to that immigration court system we have been able to speed up that process.</p>\n<p>That backlog, though, is still significant and remains.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s why we were asking Congress for significantly more resources to add some bandwidth to that court system, if you will, to try to make that system work more efficiently.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last question.\xc2\xa0 As the President considers what kinds of unilateral actions he\xe2\x80\x99s going to take in the fall to ease deportations -- he\xe2\x80\x99s asked for these recommendations -- how does this crisis affect that decision-making process?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I would say is simply that these are two separate but not completely unrelated issues.\xc2\xa0 The challenge that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in our current broken immigration system is that -- well, is a variety of things.\xc2\xa0 One is there are some, including the President, who believe that we would benefit from additional resources being used to secure the border.\xc2\xa0 There is a historic investment to border security that is contemplated in the common-sense bill that passed through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 There are limitations on how much of that you can do using executive authority.</p>\n<p>The open question that some have and that the President\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys are investigating is what exactly can you do to address some of the other problems that are caused by our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 Many of them are addressed in the Senate bill, but the question is whether or not there are additional steps that you can take to level the playing field for businesses.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are a lot of businesses right now who are very rigorous about observing immigration law, and that creates an opening for some unscrupulous businesses to undercut them and to bypass that system and essentially hire undocumented labor for cheaper. That obviously is not playing on a level playing field and one that is not fair to business owners all across the country that are trying to do the right thing.</p>\n<p>We also have this large question that looms about the population of undocumented immigrants that are already in this country.\xc2\xa0 Many of them, as the President has discussed, have lived here for quite some time, and many of them have even been raising children here, have been paying taxes.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who in many cases are largely indistinguishable from so many other Americans.\xc2\xa0 And the question is, how do you confront that challenge in a way that reflects our tradition as a country of immigrants but also a country that enforces the law?</p>\n<p>So these are all very difficult policy problems.\xc2\xa0 The real shame of all this is that the Senate has acted in bipartisan fashion to address many of these problems.\xc2\xa0 So what the President has said is let\xe2\x80\x99s look for ways -- since House Republicans have signaled that they are going to block that Senate legislation, that common-sense, bipartisan agreement, the President has said what can we do using only my executive authority to try to address some of these challenges.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the lawyers are hard at work on.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a timeframe for you other than to say the President said he wanted to see a set of recommendations by the end of the summer and that he hopes to act shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that this crisis has made that decision-making process more politically fraught?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s hard to tell.\xc2\xa0 It certainly has elevated the debate in a way that seems to sort of rise and fall based on other stories.\xc2\xa0 So I think that we have -- in some ways, this is the largest sustained elevation of this storyline in the news media, at least, in quite some time.\xc2\xa0 So in some ways, it does put Republicans in the spotlight and it makes it harder than ever for them to explain why they would block a common-sense proposal that would address so many of the problems that have been highlighted by this challenge.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s hard for me to assess at this point whether or not this has a political impact on possible executive actions that would address these problems.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Israelis have been accused by the Palestinians of acting disproportionately and, in some cases, engaging in war crimes.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything the administration believes is valid about that criticism?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that we have seen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, in Vienna, senior administration officials described what the Iranians brought to the table as unworkable and inadequate, and said it would be hard to contemplate things like an extension without seeing some significant progress on key issues.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear any of that in your original answer to Julie.\xc2\xa0 You seemed to be more deferential or respectful of what the Iranians have brought to the table.\xc2\xa0 Can you align this apparent disconnect?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a disconnect. I think that there is -- over the course of these negotiations, we have seen them engage in these conversations in a serious way. That said, there are still substantial gaps that remain.\xc2\xa0 And over the last couple of weeks we\'ve seen negotiators hard at work to try to resolve or bridge those substantial gaps.\xc2\xa0 There still remains quite a ways to go.\xc2\xa0 What Secretary Kerry has been there to assess is whether or not those gaps are, in fact, able to be bridged.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How can something be serious if it\'s unworkable and inadequate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it means that the proposal that they\xe2\x80\x99ve offered so far for bridging these gaps isn\'t sufficient to bridge the gap to our side.\xc2\xa0 I think the point is the fact that the Iranians so far have not satisfied all of our concerns I think in some ways is self-evident.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they have approached this in a way that\'s stopped short of being serious.\xc2\xa0 They have been serious about this.\xc2\xa0 But we haven\'t reached an agreement.\xc2\xa0 What they\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed so far does not address the concerns of the United States and the international community.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re going to continue to pursue efforts to bridge the substantial gap that remains.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as a result of their unworkable and inadequate proposal so far, does that make the administration less inclined to pursue and extension, or more inclined?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that is certainly part and partial of what Secretary Kerry is trying to assess in his conversations there this week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the point of continuing to read out phone calls with foreign leaders that suggest perpetually, for weeks now, the prospect of additional economic sanctions against Russia without any action actually occurring?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s an indication -- I think it should be an unmistakable signal to the Russians that there are active discussions underway about possible additional economic costs that could be imposed on Russia.\xc2\xa0 That happens to be a fact.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that for the better part of three months now, since we were in Manila, the last stage of sanctions being applied.\xc2\xa0 What is the point of continuing to discuss actions that the West finds vexing [if they] continue to happen in Ukraine and the sanctions never come?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we\'ve seen in Ukraine over the course of the last probably couple of months, as you point out, is a lot of -- are a lot of mixed signals that we\'ve seen from Russia, that there have been indications where there have been reports that troops were being withdrawn from the border with Ukraine --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe this is working?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that there are any number of reasons for us to be concerned about the continuing situation that we see on the ground in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 There is still a lot of violence there.\xc2\xa0 There are still indications that the Russians haven\'t taken the necessary steps to close off the border, that there are still heavy weapons and materiel that\'s being provided from the Russian side over to pro-Russian separatists on the Ukrainian side.\xc2\xa0 There continue to be concerns about whether or not President Putin is actually using the influence he has with those pro-Russian separatists to encourage them to abide by a cease-fire agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s not --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the fact that we\'re talking about imposing additional costs on the Russians is an indication that there\xe2\x80\x99s more we\xe2\x80\x99d like the Russians to do.\xc2\xa0 That\'s true.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I guess I\'d just try to get to the heart of the matter -- why is perpetually talking about it better than not doing it -- better than doing it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, what we would like to align here are Russia\xe2\x80\x99s steps with possible consequences, and we\'ve seen Russia do things -- like withdraw troops from the border momentarily -- and then redeploy troops, or reopen the border, or start resupplying pro-Russian separatists.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of mixed signals that we\'ve seen from Russia.\xc2\xa0 What we have made clear is that that\'s a risky business for Russia to be engaged in, that as long as they fail to contribute in a substantive way to de-escalate in that conflict they are only increasing the risk that the international community will impose further costs and further isolate Russia.</p>\n<p>There have been reports about the impact that that has had on the Russian economy in terms of capital flight, in terms of the credit rating of some of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s debt.\xc2\xa0 So there have been costs that have been imposed.\xc2\xa0 There have been consequences for the actions that the Russians have taken.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve seen the results of some of those costs that have been imposed.</p>\n<p>But, that\'s correct, there is more that we would like to see Russia do.\xc2\xa0 And there will continue to be close coordination among the United States and our allies -- in Western Europe principally -- that put Russia at risk of sustaining further costs if they fail to act constructively to de-escalate the conflict in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl went back to work and the Army put out a statement saying he\xe2\x80\x99s returning to regular duty, is how they called it, and saying that he can contribute to the mission.\xc2\xa0 My question being, since there are strong allegations that he deserted his comrades -- and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been proven, there\xe2\x80\x99s still an ongoing investigation -- why is it appropriate to let him go back to work?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I\'d refer you to the Department of Defense for a personnel matter like that.\xc2\xa0 As you point out, it\'s still under investigation and I don\'t want to be in a position of commenting on a matter that\'s still under active investigation by the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wouldn\'t they be -- with anyone in the government, not just the military, who is under investigation, they\xe2\x80\x99d be suspended, you would wait for the investigation to be completed, wouldn\'t you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the propriety of him going back to work I\'d refer you to the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why don\'t we go back to go back to Iran.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a report in the Daily Beast suggesting that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s economy is coming back strong right now in part because the U.S. and Western allies pulled back on sanctions so that the talks could go through.\xc2\xa0 Was that a mistake, to ease up on sanctions because it could undercut our stand as we sit down for these negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was not.\xc2\xa0 What we have seen is a very structured and specific plan from the P5-plus-1 to bring Iran to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 Working with Congress and with our allies around the globe, this administration, under the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, put in place the most aggressive sanctions regime against Iran.\xc2\xa0 And what that did was that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It brought them to the table, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, the tough sanctions because it was crippling them.\xc2\xa0 But now it\xe2\x80\x99s not crippling anymore.\xc2\xa0 And so is that why you have Kerry aides saying they\xe2\x80\x99re putting unworkable plans -- it got to the table, but now you take the boot off their throat and they\xe2\x80\x99re putting unworkable plans on the table.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, through this Joint Plan of Action that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to, what we did see is we saw the Iranians make significant steps toward implementing an agreement that actually rolled back their nuclear plan and rolled back their nuclear capability in a way that has demonstrated their seriousness in pursuit of these negotiations, but it has also succeeded in de-escalating tensions.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve rolled back their nuclear plan.\xc2\xa0 This is something that the international community hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been engaged in for a long time.\xc2\xa0 That is what led us to these talks that are currently underway.</p>\n<p>Now, there continue to be substantial gaps between the P5-plus-1 and Iran in terms of satisfying all of the concerns of the international community about their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the strategy that has been employed has succeeded in uniting the international community, has succeeded in bringing the Iranians to the negotiating table in a serious way, and has succeeded in rolling back the Iranian nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Broader question on foreign policy -- this Wall Street Journal story that sort of puts together all of the crises that are going on -- Iranian talks in addition to the violence in Gaza you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked about today, the ongoing civil war in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, nobody can say that these are all the President\xe2\x80\x99s fault, but he is dealing with all of them, and the story basically says right at the top that U.S. global power seems increasingly tenuous to deal with all of these challenges.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, how does the White House react to the notion that the President is a bystander to all these crises?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that there have been a number of situations in which you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this administration intervene in a meaningful way that has substantially furthered American interests and substantially improved the tranquility of the global community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You saw the United States intervene in support -- or with the support of our allies and partners to rid Syria of their declared chemical weapons stockpile.\xc2\xa0 For a long time, for decades, the Assad regime denied that they even had chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 Again, working with our partners and allies, he declared that they had these weapons, they worked with the international community to remove these weapons, and they\xe2\x80\x99re currently being destroyed aboard a U.S. ship out at sea.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, you saw Secretary Kerry travel to Afghanistan and mediate an agreement between the two presidential candidates in Afghanistan, keeping that process alive and, in fact, advancing that process.\xc2\xa0 Reaching an agreement to audit every single ballot in a presidential election in which 8 million ballots across the country were cast is a substantial, meaningful agreement and puts in sight a resolution of what had been a pretty dangerous disagreement.</p>\n<p>And just last week you saw the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State meeting in China with their counterparts to work through the robust but complex relationship that the United States has with China.\xc2\xa0 Those were serious negotiations, and there was a serious effort underway to advance American interests in the Asia Pacific.</p>\n<p>So these are just three examples that I thought of off the top of my head that demonstrate that there are -- that even in the midst of what is a very complicated and dangerous world that the Obama administration thinks that this President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership is succeeding in advancing American interests around the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one on immigration.\xc2\xa0 A couple of times you\xe2\x80\x99ve said -- pushing House Republicans to act on comprehensive reform, you said the Senate bill addresses a lot of these challenges we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing right now.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m curious about is what in the Gang of Eight bill would specifically prevent this surge in illegal immigration from Central America?\xc2\xa0 What in that bill would stop this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you listen to some Republicans, what they would say is that increasing our investment in border security would send a very clear message to people in Central America who are contemplating coming to this country illegally, or attempting to at least migrate to this country in a way that would allow them to enter the country without proper documentation.\xc2\xa0 So an investment of 20,000 additional boots on the ground that\'s included in the Senate bill would certainly be -- based on the standards set by Republicans would be a tangible contribution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but what specifically in the bill would actually accomplish --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, but they do say that that would send a message --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You never quote them on immigration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure we do.\xc2\xa0 Well, you guys do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I mean you really believe --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t really believe them.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, Governor Perry is the longest serving governor of Texas, and Texas is the state with the longest border of any state in the country, and he says --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing specific in the bill.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He says that -- he says specifically that the symbol of putting additional resources on the border would prevent the flow of immigration, of illegal immigration across the border.\xc2\xa0 So maybe Governor Perry is wrong about that.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes in border security and is willing to support an investment in it.</p>\n<p>Nadia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on Gaza and ask the question slightly differently.\xc2\xa0 How do you explain the high number of Palestinian casualties -- 170 dead so far, half of them are civilians, 36 are children?\xc2\xa0 Does the administration believe that Israel is acting within international law and without the Fourth Geneva Convention for protection of civilians?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Nadia, what we have done is we have encouraged leaders on both sides of this issue to provide -- or at least demonstrate some concern for the safety and well-being of innocent civilians.\xc2\xa0 We have seen Hamas repeatedly in the last couple of weeks fire rockets that are aimed squarely at civilians, attempting to inflict terrible damage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because of the Iron Dome, there are no civilian casualties.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because of the Iron Dome, thank God, there is no Israeli casualties.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking about the Palestinian side. How do you respond to the high casualties of Palestinians?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have articulated our concern about the casualties that have been sustained on both sides over the last several weeks.\xc2\xa0 We have concern about the casualties sustained by civilians on the Palestinian side as well.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraging both sides to exhibit as much restraint as possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we do that with the full knowledge that it is completely unacceptable for rockets to continue to be fired from Palestinian Territory, aimed squarely at Israeli civilians.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we have called repeatedly on Hamas to end that rocket fire.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to encourage Israelis -- at the same time while respecting their right to defend their country and their civilians, we\xe2\x80\x99ve urged them to exhibit some concern for the lives of civilians as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say the President wants to mediate, but is the White House calling for an immediate cease-fire?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly would like to see a cease-fire along the lines of the cease-fire that both sides agreed to and was facilitated by the United States about a year and a half ago; that that certainly is the kind of agreement that we would like to see in that area that would restore some -- at least some measure of peace in the area.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up on that, because you had said on Friday that the White House wanted to leverage relationships in the region to bring about a de-escalation to help perhaps get a return to a cease-fire.\xc2\xa0 And yet, as you know, the situation has changed significantly with the key players there -- certainly Egypt with new leadership, a new President there.\xc2\xa0 Turkey certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a relationship with Hamas; in fact, you could say they fractured the relationship.\xc2\xa0 So can you be more specific about what the options are for leveraging relationships or just more generally bringing about a cease-fire?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to chronicle all the kinds of conversations that have taken place between senior administration officials and leaders in that region.\xc2\xa0 You are underscoring an important point, which is that there are a lot of cross-currents when it comes to the complicated web of relationships that exist in that region of the world.\xc2\xa0 But what the United States continues to do is to encourage both sides to pursue a path toward de-escalating this conflict.\xc2\xa0 And that includes working with other interested parties -- some of whom may have more influence than others -- on either side to articulate that point of view as well, and to reinforce the need for both sides to pursue this path toward de-escalation.</p>\n<p>Right now, the violence that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve either side well at all.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we are going to be engaged in an effort to facilitate a de-escalation of the violence there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when you talk about what you call cross-currents with the change in the situation there, does it mean that the U.S. influence is less now than it was in 2012?\xc2\xa0 Is it more difficult for us to use our influence there to bring about a cease-fire?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d actually make the case to you that it\xe2\x80\x99s more important the United States play a role, given the fast-changing nature of the relationships that exists there, having a country with the credibility and stature of the United States of America to work with the variety of actors in the region to try to facilitate the kind of cease-fire agreement that we saw that was effective in November of 2012.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s more important than ever that the United States continue to play a role in trying to facilitate the de-escalation and the violence on both sides.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why the hesitation to send Secretary Kerry?\xc2\xa0 Or is there a hesitation to send Secretary Kerry?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that there has been hesitation to send Secretary Kerry.\xc2\xa0 I think that there is a desire to maximize our leverage in this situation to try to get to a place where we can have some success in reaching a cease-fire agreement.\xc2\xa0 But over the last several days, Secretary Kerry has been in China, negotiating with his Chinese counterparts in the context of the security and economic dialogue there.\xc2\xa0 Then he traveled straight to Afghanistan where he mediated this agreement between the two presidential candidates.\xc2\xa0 Then he was on to Vienna where he was sitting with his Iranian counterpart a couple of times in the context of the P5-plus-1 negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So his dance card has been pretty full the last few days.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of additional visits, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to announce from here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the United States remains fully engaged in this region. This is a priority.\xc2\xa0 We stand with our ally, Israel, and we will protect their right to defend their country.\xc2\xa0 But we remain very concerned about the violence and the well-being of civilians on both sides of that dispute.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a quick one on the border issue.\xc2\xa0 HHS Secretary Burwell met with governors from both parties yesterday and apparently governors from both parties expressed concern about the cost to states if some of these children come in -- education and so on.\xc2\xa0 She didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything coming out, but can you tell us anything about these conversations or any conversations that the President may have had with some of these governors and what he has said to them to allay their concerns about, in particular, the economic impact?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what you have laid out there is yet another consequence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to deal with our broken immigration system, specifically as it relates to this one particular issue that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen arise in the last few weeks on the southwest border.\xc2\xa0 Many of the biggest problems could be addressed with the passage of the supplemental appropriations request that the administration has put forward.</p>\n<p>So some of the concerns I think the governors were expressing is if you have this significant backlog in the immigration court system, that means that there will be more people who are temporarily remaining in the United States\xc2\xa0 -- in some cases, that means temporarily being in the community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, we have been clear about what our priorities are:\xc2\xa0 national security and the safety of communities is a top priority.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to implement the law in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s in line with those priorities.\xc2\xa0 But the other way that we can address some of the concerns that governors have raised is to reduce the backlog in the immigration court system to allow that system to operate more efficiently and more effectively.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what we have included in our supplemental appropriations request is funding for more judges and prosecutors and asylum officials who can process those claims more quickly to reduce that backlog and address some of the concerns that the governors have raised.</p>\n<p>So those governors who have been most outspoken in articulating their concerns about the consequences of the broken immigration system for their state, we certainly would welcome them to our side of the effort to encourage Congress to pass the supplemental appropriations request the President put forward at the beginning of last week, but also to join the broader fight to pass the common-sense immigration reform proposal that passed the Senate with bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But no conversations you can tell us about beyond obviously Governor Perry and Governor Hickenlooper?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, no specific conversations between the President and other governors at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I assume you were there.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if perhaps Governor Hickenlooper maybe threw a pool game or two?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some back-and-forth about that and the $20 that was exchanged.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would be surprised if Governor Hickenlooper would say that he threw a pool game to the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you that there is no one who would be more upset about that than the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Jessica.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Egypt -- I know Egypt was just invited to the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit after not being invited in January, and the White House said that\'s because it\xe2\x80\x99s now reinstated by the African Union.\xc2\xa0 But aside from that, what\xe2\x80\x99s the importance to the White House of having Egypt at the summit, and not only for the United States but for the region?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, one of the goals of this U.S.-Africa Summit to facilitate the relationships that the United States maintains with all of the countries on that continent.\xc2\xa0 There is enormous economic potential that exists certainly for the citizens of those countries, but also for businesses in this country.</p>\n<p>The other thing that we would like to do is nurture some of the advocates for democracy that we see in these countries.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, those advocates are pretty aggressively squelched.\xc2\xa0 What we would like to see is we want to encourage the development of governing systems that are respectful of basic human rights, and certainly the kinds of rights that are so central to our system of government in this country.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a lot more to say about the value of the U.S.-Africa Summit and some of the goals that we hope to achieve in the context of those meetings.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly welcome the participation of all of those who will participate in the meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this an opportunity to talk Gaza on the sidelines?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s too early for me to say at this point what kinds of sideline conversations will be had in the context of that meeting.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to go back to something you just said to Ed.\xc2\xa0 Do you really believe that this President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy has contributed to what you called the \xe2\x80\x9ctranquility of the global community\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Do you really think at this point in time you can talk about the tranquility of the global community?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that there are certain places where the United States -- just based on those three examples that I cited before -- where we can certainly cite tangible progress that\'s been made in pursuit of American interests.\xc2\xa0 Ridding Syria of chemical weapons and ensuring that they no longer are a proliferation risk is certainly clearly within the interest of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 Resolving --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t think Syria is tranquil right now, do you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I didn\'t say that either.\xc2\xa0 The other thing is that resolving the difference of opinion between the presidential candidates in Afghanistan certainly will allow us to move forward with American policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is this outstanding question about the bilateral security agreement that is the source of some concern here, and it has a certain -- a significant impact on what our military posture will look like after the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 That certainly was important progress that was made by Secretary Kerry just this weekend.\xc2\xa0 And the kind of robust engagement that you saw between U.S. officials and Chinese officials in the context of the S&amp;ED is also important to advancing U.S. interests in that region of the world.</p>\n<p>So I would acknowledge readily that there is a lot of conflict and instability in hotspots all over the globe, but it has not eliminated the United States\xe2\x80\x99 ability or the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to look out for and even advance American interests in a variety of regions across the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Josh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had -- Attorney General Eric Holder came out and he said that the inflow of Westerners into the civil war in Syria is the most frightening thing -- \xe2\x80\x9cmore frightening than anything I have seen as Attorney General.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ve had the foreign policy experts in the Wall Street Journal talk about how this is instability not seen since the 1970s.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They\'re not exactly an impartial source, though.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A terrorist group -- well, it\xe2\x80\x99s the front page of the Wall Street Journal.\xc2\xa0 This was not a partisan -- these were not just partisan foreign policy experts.\xc2\xa0 I think that you see a wide range of people looking at basically an all-out war, what\xe2\x80\x99s looking like an all-out war in Israel and the Palestinian Territories.\xc2\xa0 You see the situation with a terrorist group taking over vast territory in Iraq and in Syria.\xc2\xa0 You see Russian aggression in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 You see concerns about Chinese aggression in the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t seem like a time to be touting tranquility on the international scene.\xc2\xa0 Do you think the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy bears any responsibility for any of this?\xc2\xa0 Or if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that he can do about any of this?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what the President has been really clear about is that he will allow one core principle to guide his thinking about what we can do to advance U.S. interests in each of these hotspots that you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the national security interest of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, when it came to eliminating Bashar al-Assad\xe2\x80\x99s declared chemical weapons stockpile, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made substantial progress in advancing American interests.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to mediating an agreement between two competing presidential candidates in Afghanistan who are prepared to sort of take that process off the rails, is a tangible contribution to American interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there is an important role for the United States to play.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. influence continues to be important to resolving so many of the situations that you cited.\xc2\xa0 That is why people often refer to and continue to refer to the United States as the one indispensable country in the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you point out, there are large countries around the globe that have substantial strategic or even economic influence, but they aren\xe2\x80\x99t involved in each of those situations that you referenced.\xc2\xa0 In each of the situations that you referenced, people are asking a legitimate question about what\xe2\x80\x99s the proper role for the United States\xe2\x80\x99 involvement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as the President considers each of those situations, he considers at the core the consequences it has for American national security.\xc2\xa0 That will continue to be the way that he works his way through these very difficult and complicated circumstances.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I ask you just to clarify what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked several times here today about the negotiations with Iran?\xc2\xa0 Is the President open to the idea of an extension, or is July 20th a true deadline in those nuclear talks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, July 20th is a true deadline, and that was part of the Joint Plan of Action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No extensions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know that there has been a lot of talk of extensions.\xc2\xa0 And what we have said is that this is part of what Secretary Kerry has traveled there to assess, is whether or not substantive progress can be made.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll make that assessment based on the conversations that he\xe2\x80\x99s had there.\xc2\xa0 He is going to report back to the President, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to give you an update about whether or not an extension is something that we would either find necessary or even desirable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you think Congress is going to go along?\xc2\xa0 I mean, if Congress was ready to go ahead with tougher sanctions, the administration convinced Democratic leaders in Congress to hold off and let these talks go forward, is Congress going to go along with a further extension if that\xe2\x80\x99s the route you\xe2\x80\x99re going to go?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As you point out, Congress has been a very important partner in this process for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s because of the sanctions that Congress passed that the President has worked to implement that we were able to put so much pressure on Iran in the first place to bring them to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 Bringing them to the negotiating table resulted in them rolling back part of their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So Congress has been an important partner in this process all along, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to keep Congress in the loop as we evaluate the ongoing conversations there and any plans beyond July 20th.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, Governor Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who is a potential presidential candidate, when asked about these children down at the border, said, we are not a country that should send children back to certain death.\xc2\xa0 Does the Governor have a legitimate point there?\xc2\xa0 And does the President have any reservations about sending these children back to some pretty violent circumstances?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you asked that question because I think there are two important points for people to understand as they\xe2\x80\x99re taking a look at this situation.\xc2\xa0 The first is pretty simple.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to enforce the law.\xc2\xa0 Enforcing the law is obviously an important principle and something that the President swore to do when he took office.\xc2\xa0 It also serves as an important deterrent.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear that parents, either in the U.S. or in Central America, should not entrust their children with strangers, criminals, to make the long journey from Central America to the southwest border with the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but the kids are here.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re going to send them back to some pretty dangerous conditions.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right, well, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that we have sent a clear message to those parents who are contemplating whether or not they should send their kids on this dangerous journey, and articulating our commitment to enforcing the law should serve as an effective deterrent; so should actually enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 So when there are those parents who hear of children being returned after they have gone through their due process in the immigration courts, it serves as an effective deterrent.\xc2\xa0 And that will effectively make the case --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that will stop the coyotes from sending those kids up here?\xc2\xa0 Just by sending them back, that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to put that --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, Jim -- I said an effective deterrent as it relates to parents who are contemplating making this kind of decision.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a clear case that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made, and that case is only strengthened when it becomes clear that children are returned.</p>\n<p>Now, let me say one other thing about this -- and this is important as well, and this more directly goes to what Governor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley said:\xc2\xa0 These children and other immigrants who are attempting to enter the country without documentation will go through the immigration process, and that means their claims of asylum will be considered by an immigration judge and by asylum officials.\xc2\xa0 What that means is it means that if an immigration judge determines that they face a credible threat of death upon their return to their home country, then -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not an immigration judge, but it is likely that the immigration judge will find that that person should be granted humanitarian relief.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because earlier you had said that the vast majority or the majority of these kids probably won\xe2\x80\x99t qualify for some kind of legal status --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but what you are saying here is that some of those kids are going to be allowed to stay, that they will likely have some legal standing if it\xe2\x80\x99s determined by those judges that they will be allowed to stay.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We have said from the beginning that we are going to respect the basic due process to which these individuals are entitled.\xc2\xa0 That continues to be true, and that is what -- again, and that is part and partial of the law that we\xe2\x80\x99re enforcing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what do you make of -- you heard these comments from Senator Coburn and others, well, we just spent X million dollars, we can all buy them first-class tickets and just put them all on a plane and send them back.\xc2\xa0 What does the White House think of those comments?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard of that rather novel suggestion before.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about the way that we think this should work, which is we should respect the basic humanitarian needs of those individuals who are apprehended along the border. That means, in some cases, setting up detention facilities that are operated by HHS that sort of fall in line with generally accepted standards to care for those individuals who have been apprehended, and in some cases children.\xc2\xa0 HHS has operating facilities like this in a number of communities.</p>\n<p>The other thing that we would like to see is we would like to see this system work more efficiently so that after they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through the immigration process, that these individuals can be returned. \xc2\xa0The other thing that we have also done is worked with our partners in Central America.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President took an important trip there a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 I know that Secretary Kerry was there just last week, I believe, and had conversations with Central American leaders about what they can do to try to stem this flow at the source.\xc2\xa0 That means improving the security situation in many of these countries.\xc2\xa0 It also means working with these countries to set up a system of repatriating individuals who are being returned from the U.S. back to their home country.</p>\n<p>All of this will serve to enforce the law and will serve as a deterrent to those who may be contemplating trying to enter the country illegally.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Jon mentioned this -- Eric Holder\xe2\x80\x99s interview over the weekend where he talked about Americans and Europeans going to Syria being the most -- or more fighting than anything he\xe2\x80\x99s heard or seen as Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration doing about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a number of things that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that Secretary Johnson could tell you about in more detail. Secretary Johnson, Attorney General Holder, other senior law enforcement officials in this administration have been in close touch with our partners around the globe to confront this challenge.\xc2\xa0 This is also a challenge that is facing -- or a threat that is facing other Western countries as well.\xc2\xa0 Many of these individuals who have traveled to Syria don\xe2\x80\x99t just hold American passports, they may hold the passports of some Western allies of the United States as well.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re working closely in consultation with our allies to monitor these individuals.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration believe that -- or does the intelligence community believe that those Americans and Europeans are coming back -- that those Americans are coming back?\xc2\xa0 Once they go to Syria, they come back to the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there certainly is a risk associated with that, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the risk that the Attorney General was talking about.\xc2\xa0 But this is a matter that the administration has been talking about for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on this, and there have been a number of consultations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaged in, from -- senior White House officials have been talking to their counterparts about this.\xc2\xa0 We also have had other intelligence officials and other senior law enforcement officials engaged in a coordinated effort with the international community to mitigate this threat.\xc2\xa0 But there is no doubt that the threat that the Attorney General was referring to is real.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the first President to put forward a comprehensive immigration reform plan is President George W. Bush.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also the President who signed this trafficking bill that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking a lot about.\xc2\xa0 Has President Obama reached out to President Bush and asked for his help in maybe convincing other Republicans to get on board here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any presidential conversations to read out to you at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think he might have, or should have?\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that help?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, former President Bush is certainly not the only Republican to articulate his strong support for common-sense immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We saw 14 members, Republican members of the United States Senate vote for a common-sense immigration proposal.\xc2\xa0 So this is not -- President Bush is not unique among members of the Republican Party in terms of his support for immigration reform along the lines of the compromise that was passed through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly welcome the outspoken advocacy of anybody, a Democrat or Republican, who supports this proposal.</p>\n<p>Juliette.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Questions on two different subjects.\xc2\xa0 First, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee has called for a boycott of the Iftar dinners that both the President himself and other government agencies are holding tonight, citing both those strikes in Gaza as well as the allegations that the NSA had spied on Muslim leaders.\xc2\xa0 Can I get your comment on what you think about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The goal of the Iftar dinner here tonight at the White House is to observe a religious tradition that Muslims all around the globe are observing at this time of Ramadan.\xc2\xa0 It also is an opportunity for the President and other senior administration officials to pay tribute to the important role that Muslim Americans play in American communities all across the country.\xc2\xa0 There are immigrants to this country from a variety of regions of the world who are Muslim.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it is important for every American to understand that they are critical to the success of our country and interwoven into the basic fabric that makes the United States of America such a unique place to live.\xc2\xa0 Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s dinner is an opportunity to pay tribute to that contribution, and we certainly respect the differences that some people may have on this -- on these matters.\xc2\xa0 But we would not want that to overshadow the efforts of the President and other senior administration officials to pay tribute to the contribution that so many American Muslims play in their communities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A second one.\xc2\xa0 Just on infrastructure, obviously, the administration back in April proposed closing tax loopholes to pay for needed infrastructure projects.\xc2\xa0 It seems quite unlikely that Congress is going to act on any kind of tax reform at this time.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration open to other funding mechanisms to achieve the public investment in infrastructure that the President has been calling for?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President believes so strongly in the importance of keeping the Highway Trust Fund solvent that we would certainly entertain other proposals.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what we think is the best way to do this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a common-sense proposal that we think deserves bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 As you know, it entails closing tax loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and the well connected, and using that revenue to fund infrastructure projects that everybody benefits from all across the country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty common-sense proposal.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d like to see some support from members of Congress for it, but if there are other ideas that people want to put forward, we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly open to considering them as well.</p>\n<p>Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on what Juliette asked about?\xc2\xa0 The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee says the reason they don\'t want to come to any Iftar dinners by government is \xe2\x80\x9cgiven the government\xe2\x80\x99s condoning of the current slaughter of Palestinians in Palestine and the spying on American Arab and Muslims domestically.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Are they wrong on that?\xc2\xa0 Are they right?\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. government condoning the death of the Palestinians?\xc2\xa0 And do you spy on Arab Americans?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as it relates to the Palestinian citizens and civilians, let me just take this opportunity to restate our concern about the safety and welfare of innocent civilians on both sides of the conflict.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We remain concerned and are encouraging the leaders of both sides to reflect that concern for those individuals\xe2\x80\x99 safety as they consider the best way to de-escalate this conflict.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons that not just the United States, but people all around the world I think would have some hesitation about a ground offensive by the Israelis, is that it would put at risk even more civilians.\xc2\xa0 So we would like to see a de-escalation of this conflict for the benefit of civilians on both sides of that conflict.</p>\n<p>As it relates to the recent reports of spying on Muslim Americans, I would point out that unlike some other countries, the United States of America doesn\xe2\x80\x99t target individuals based on their race or ethnicity or religion.\xc2\xa0 That is a principle to which we scrupulously adhere and that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 For more details on this, I would encourage you to check in with the Director of National Intelligence.</p>\n<p>April, and then Roger, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll call it a day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a couple of questions on Africa.\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on what Jessica had asked you in another line.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to investment, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a concern for many decades that those who make promises to sub-Saharan Africa to build, to do what have you there, sometimes they don\xe2\x80\x99t fulfill their promises and take more than they give.\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be some type of mechanism through this conference that will be set up that will gauge and oversee the commitments of investment that\xe2\x80\x99s made into sub-Saharan Africa?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have the opportunity to talk about this a lot more in a couple of weeks as that summit comes closer.\xc2\xa0 But the whole reason that we are having a summit like this is because there is plenty of common ground to be seized.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for African nations to benefit from greater collaboration and coordination with American interests, both governmental and private sector.\xc2\xa0 And there certainly is an opportunity for American businesses to benefit from the large markets that exist in many of these African countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So facilitating greater cooperation and coordination between the United States and these nations in Africa is an important national priority and can make important strides forward not just for the United States, but for a number of private-sector interests in the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I raise that because you said something really important.\xc2\xa0 You said \xe2\x80\x9cto benefit\xe2\x80\x9d -- there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to benefit.\xc2\xa0 During the Bush years, there was strong concern that China was doing a lot of investment into some African countries and not fulfilling its obligations and its promises.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why I\xe2\x80\x99m coming back asking, are there mechanisms going to be put in place or in place to kind of gauge the investment you put in, but are you taking out more than you\xe2\x80\x99re giving to the country?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And, again, what I think I would say is that there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for both the United States and private interests in the U.S. as well as the wide range of African nations who will be participating in the summit to benefit from a stronger relationship between our country and theirs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, and lastly, on the Sudan.\xc2\xa0 The EU is placing sanctions -- South Sudan -- on two of the leaders in South Sudan.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk to me about the White House\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts about that, and are you looking for stiffer sanctions, stiffer actions yourself?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to telegraph specific sanctions that the United States might be contemplating, but the conflict between Sudan and South Sudan, April, is one that we have been very focused on for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 We have worked closely with the international community, our partners and allies in the region, including in Africa, to try to deescalate that conflict and to get both sides to put down their arms.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So much of the violence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen inside South Sudan has had a terrible impact on their economy and on civilians in that country.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with the international community to try to restore some civility and some measure of peace to that country.\xc2\xa0 Those efforts are ongoing and those are efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing with our allies and with partners in the region.</p>\n<p>Roger, you get the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Back to the highway bill.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you mentioned earlier, introduced the $302 billion bill but the House and Senate are going in far different directions, and they are much less generous -- more ambitious, I should say.\xc2\xa0 Is the President okay with that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that there have been a number of proposals that have been put forward for keeping the Highway Trust Fund solvent.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now is making sure that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expire.\xc2\xa0 If it does, as I mentioned at the top, that would put at risk nearly 700,000 jobs across the nation and many active highway and transit projects would be threatened if the trust fund -- if Congress fails to pass a new transportation bill before the trust fund expires.</p>\n<p>So we are -- we continue to be concerned about this situation and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re urging Congress to take action.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward our -- what we think is the best way for us to address this problem over the long term, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a priority of this administration to make sure that the trust fund does not expire.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good Monday.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:20 P.M.
