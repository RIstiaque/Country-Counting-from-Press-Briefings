EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Get any sleep?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 About three hours.\xc2\xa0 Charitably I\xe2\x80\x99d say -- I\xe2\x80\x99d round up to three hours, how about that?\xc2\xa0 But I know some of you all got less than that, so -- as the press charter was in a little bit later.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me do one quick announcement before we go forward.\xc2\xa0 President Obama will meet with President Zardari of Pakistan here at the White House tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 The two leaders will discuss aspects of the U.S.-Pakistan strategic partnership, including our mutual commitment to economic reform, support for democracy and good governance, and joint efforts to combat terrorism.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The meeting is closed press, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do some still stuff out of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, take us away.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is that meeting closed press tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just -- that\xe2\x80\x99s just the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to do it.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s in town for Holbrooke\xe2\x80\x99s service, and we thought it was a good opportunity to add a meeting with President Zardari.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think with the speech last night the President accomplished what he wanted to accomplish with the speech?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think in -- I talked a little bit about this on the plane on the way back -- I think the President had thought about this on many different levels since we all got the news Saturday of the horrific and senseless events.\xc2\xa0 I think he thought of this as the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 I think he thought of this as a friend of the congresswoman.\xc2\xa0 And I think he thought, as you all heard him talk about in the Oval Office on Monday, I think he thought of this as a parent.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve all probably gone through -- many in this country have gone through thinking about this at many different levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think what the President had hoped to do last night was to speak both to the community of Tucson and to the nation.\xc2\xa0 And I think his message of ensuring that our enduring way of government moves forward in a way that best honors the memories of those that were victims of this tragedy, as well as those that we look forward to seeing recover.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When he called for better discourse last night, did he specifically have Sarah Palin in mind and her comments about \xe2\x80\x9cblood libel\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- I would point you to many things in the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- in venues that the President has discussed this, the notion of civility in our public discourse -- dates back to his time in the State Senate in Springfield; at the University of Michigan, at the commencement last year.\xc2\xa0 I have heard him say for as long as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with him the notion of disagreeing without being disagreeable.\xc2\xa0 Those are aspects I think that he has tried to live his public life by.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And obviously the speech -- the President added a pretty hefty notion of empathy in the speech that, again, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken on on many different occasions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what is your view on Sarah Palin\xe2\x80\x99s choice of words with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cblood libel\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m -- I think there are plenty of people that can render opinions on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do that.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to talk about what the President said last night.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the role I best play in this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shifting gears to the China visit next week, what does the President hope to accomplish?\xc2\xa0 And can you talk about the format for the press conference?\xc2\xa0 I know that you pushed hard for that.\xc2\xa0 Are there going to be more than one question each side, or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will admit, I\xe2\x80\x99m a tad behind.\xc2\xa0 I believe there will be more than one question, but I will double-check on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there will be an opportunity for question. *<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the issues that you\xe2\x80\x99re -- you will -- that the President wants to discuss are many of the issues that you have heard us as an administration talk about for the length of our tenure here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important bilateral relationship.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there will be discussion on global economic issues, as well as security issues like North Korea and Iran, and important issues of political reform and human rights.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our hope is -- and again, I\xe2\x80\x99m still working out some of the details on this -- but we will have -- likely be joined in some manner tomorrow by our National Security Advisor Tom Donilon to walk through some of what you\xe2\x80\x99ll see next week and some of -- additional things that we hope to discuss and cover.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on last night and the idea of unity, the President has talked about and campaigned about bringing the country together in 2004 and 2008.\xc2\xa0 In what way has he not been able -- why has he not been able to bring the country together in the two years that he\xe2\x80\x99s been President?\xc2\xa0 And is there some way in which his behavior is going to change after Tucson?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Ann, I think that what the President would tell you on that answer is that -- I think -- and I think this was conveyed in his speech last night -- that we are not going to remove disagreement from our democracy.\xc2\xa0 And we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the underpinning of the notion of our self-government.\xc2\xa0 But the tone and the approach that we take in those debates I think is what we all hope changes because of both the events of the past few days, but I think anybody would say that -- and, again, I think you see it in the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, that our civil discourse has become more and more polarized.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- I think the President hopes that, again, we can have disagreements without disparaging and being disagreeable toward others.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see plenty of opportunities in the next few years where you have those disagreements.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that, again, the tone and the approach on both sides -- and this isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a one-way street, it\xe2\x80\x99s for us too -- to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing this in a way, as I think the President so eloquently said last night, is befitting the memory of those in Tucson.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Governor Palin\xe2\x80\x99s message yesterday, the overall message, head in the wrong direction?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think there are plenty that can --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s a public figure; the White House could have an opinion on her overall message.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to speak to what the President said and how he came about saying it, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll let others opine on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he seen her video, Robert?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your own presence here, have you decided how --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Have I or has he?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your own presence here, have you decided on a departure date?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not.\xc2\xa0 I have -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any news on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on Ann\xe2\x80\x99s first question about tone and tenor, and whatnot?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the State of the Union coming up, the President in the last State of the Union talked about reaching out more to Republicans, wanting to have regular meetings with them.\xc2\xa0 And he seemed to be honest and frank after the midterm elections in telling them, the Republican leaders in private, look, I need to do a better job on this.\xc2\xa0 He was upfront about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my question is, with a new State of the Union coming up, there\xe2\x80\x99s been some speculation that maybe the President will use the State of the Union to build on last night.\xc2\xa0 How do you see him -- whether or not he really is going to build on last night in the State of the Union, will there be the similar tone and approach?\xc2\xa0 And then how does he actually take the action to follow up on what he said in last year\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union about reaching out?\xc2\xa0 Like, how does it become a reality instead of both sides saying, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it?\xc2\xa0 How does he think --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99re very correct, Ed, in -- obviously elements of what you heard last night, improvements in our civil discourse and how we debate issues, will certainly play a role in this year\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, this is something I think if you go back and -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in the campaign or -- you certainly can see it visibly in the 2004 convention address, but obviously speeches throughout his career where he talks about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99re right -- the President was very candid with those Republican and Democratic leaders after the election that he had to do better.\xc2\xa0 And I think, quite frankly, we were -- the country was successful at -- in getting things done in the lame duck session because of that very notion.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a greater effort on our part in a much more systematic way to do the types of meetings that we had here before.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody wants to take -- or I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody believes that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to simply remove the disagreement from our democracy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the very definition of it.\xc2\xa0 But I think the way in which we do it, the tone, our approach, is something I think we will all -- we all should be much more mindful of, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think that was in large part --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it seems like that will be a big part of the State of the Union in some way at least.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I have not, obviously, looked through a ton of the drafts at this point, but I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that it will play a role.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow, then.\xc2\xa0 How does Bill Daley play into that, since we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to talk to you to brief this week, in terms of he\xe2\x80\x99s taken over officially?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of talk about his ability to work with Republicans.\xc2\xa0 The Chamber of Commerce and others immediately said this is a great pick.\xc2\xa0 Moving forward, what kind of impact do you think Bill Daley will have in terms of that relationship with Republicans but also moving the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, et cetera?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think obviously Bill is somebody who brings vast experience working with both sides of the aisle.\xc2\xa0 I think that was true when he was Commerce Secretary and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s been true in his endeavors in business.\xc2\xa0 And I think, as you said, it\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in the statements that were made upon the announcement last week that he would assume the job of chief of staff.\xc2\xa0 And as you said -- I was not -- I was in Tucson yesterday, so I was not here yesterday, but he began yesterday at the 7:30 a.m. senior staff meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, look, I think that -- again, I think he brings a vast amount of experience in working with others, but, look, I think it also, for all of us, has to -- the truth is, it\xe2\x80\x99s all of us.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s everybody that works here, it\xe2\x80\x99s everybody that works in government and public service, and it includes the leaders of our country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Keeping with that general much lighter note, given the solemn times, have you decided not to put toilet paper on the White House because of your wonderful Auburn victory?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it is a wonderful tradition probably best reserved for Toomer\xe2\x80\x99s Corner in Auburn, where there\xe2\x80\x99s -- there are many rolls currently hanging in a beautiful tree there now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about in front of your house?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My son is quite excited that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that for the third time.\xc2\xa0 I realize I might have unwound something that might be harder in the end to wind back, but -- yes --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely possible that we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned earlier that there was a lot of empathy --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What a lovely tradition.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a lot of empathy inserted into the speech.\xc2\xa0 How did the President come to that?\xc2\xa0 Because in the past it\xe2\x80\x99s been noted that perhaps he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as forthcoming with empathy as some of his predecessors.\xc2\xa0 Was it new staff advice?\xc2\xa0 Was it the five-day period which he had to think this thing over before he spoke?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, first and foremost, look, again, I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him discuss and I think many of you all have heard him discuss over the course of many years the notion that -- what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to understand and -- understand other people, people we don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with maybe in a political sense.\xc2\xa0 I guess the -- one way of saying it is to walk a mile in somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that -- that\xe2\x80\x99s animated much of his public life.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d trace that -- probably the first time you heard it on a bigger stage obviously is the 2004 convention speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, this was -- and I did a little of this on -- last night and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the gaggle.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this was -- I think last night was a speech that was very much the President\xe2\x80\x99s and he spent a great deal of time going through his thoughts on this and spent a lot of time working on what he wanted to say, including making edits even after the plane had landed in Arizona last night.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the empathy seems to adhere more to his comments about the victims than it did about the political discourse.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s said those things before, the political discourse.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 No, no, I meant the empathy in the sense of -- I guess I\xe2\x80\x99d point you in that sense to the -- those sections of the speech talking about these individuals whose lives were celebrated remind us of our mothers, our grandmothers, our brothers, and just the notion of using their example in a way to lead our lives in a better way befitting their memory.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something the President has spent a lot of time thinking about and talking about over the course of many years, including, as you mention, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about here, our civility and our civil discourse.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, was there much study of previous presidential speeches following a national tragedy of this nature?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mike, let me see if there\xe2\x80\x99s any information on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure what he might have read before this.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think a lot of the process of this was in personal reflection, was in -- I mean, I think, again, when we all heard the news, it was hard to understand.\xc2\xa0 It still is.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s senseless.\xc2\xa0 As you heard the President say, we may never truly know why.\xc2\xa0 And it gives you an opportunity to reflect.\xc2\xa0 It is hard to read some of those stories, the lives that people led, what they were doing on that otherwise beautiful day in an exercise in our own democracy shattered by the events.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of trying to change the tone a bit, you have last night\xe2\x80\x99s speech, you have the State of the Union coming up.\xc2\xa0 Is there thought of maybe a presidential event that could --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think in the near term, obviously, I guess I would point you to the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 But, look, I think the President will continue to look for opportunities to build on what Ed talked about and what the President has talked about, which is how we reach across the aisle, how we have that more civil debate and discourse.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, again, to go back to the Michigan speech, it was -- said a little bit of it last night, but I think the notion that -- what we lose in a debate that is overly charged and overly personal is the ability at some point to all sit together at a table and come to a good conclusion on solving some of our most serious problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I point to I think the -- some of what happened in the lame duck session of Congress, which was -- whether it was the tax cuts, whether it was the START treaty, whether it was \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d -- all very important achievements in the sense that we had been struggling with their -- those questions for quite some time and found some bipartisan answers.\xc2\xa0 And I think that provides -- hopefully provides a roadmap for how we can get some stuff done this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one for me.\xc2\xa0 Is it hard for you guys to -- after such a national tragedy -- to know when to get back to business full-time in terms of full steam ahead with the agenda when the nation is sad?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that -- again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve all had time -- and I think you guys, too -- I mean, I think everybody in the country has had some time to reflect on this.\xc2\xa0 And I think all those that were -- remember, they were there to, again, see the exercising of the way we govern our country, and I think that while we will continue to celebrate the lives of those that were lost and hope for and pray for the speedy recovery of those that were injured or some that are and some that aren\xe2\x80\x99t in the hospital, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see -- because they would have wanted that -- us getting back to the business of, again, how do we solve those problems and how do we do it in a way that lives up to the thoughts and the aspirations of those that were involved in the tragic events.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, talk of civil discourse, of sitting down and talking together.\xc2\xa0 Much of the course of the last two years, Republican leaders for a time were up here on a weekly basis off camera.\xc2\xa0 There was the trip to Baltimore.\xc2\xa0 There was the Blair House trip.\xc2\xa0 And what ended up happening is people would walk away from that, instead of emphasizing areas of agreement, would emphasize their areas of disagreement in order to score points with their various -- varied political bases.\xc2\xa0 So, my question is, voters respond to red meat.\xc2\xa0 Voters respond to the differences.\xc2\xa0 How can the words, no matter how eloquent are spoken by the President or anyone else, change the political incentive towards vitriol?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we have to separate out differences and discourse, because, as I said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to -- we are not going to take differences out of our democracy.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- that\xe2\x80\x99s inherent in -- look, the founders had some very different ideas amongst themselves as to how to construct the union that we call America now.\xc2\xa0 We have taken occasion in more than two centuries to build off of some of those debates and create something more toward the perfect union that we strive for.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to remove difference from democracy and self-government.\xc2\xa0 But the way we approach and the way we talk about those differences I think is something that all of us -- the President, leaders of both parties, members of both parties -- have to work hard to strive to make progress on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the description that you laid out at the beginning of this is the easiest -- it\xe2\x80\x99s the easiest thing.\xc2\xa0 And we have to resist the temptation, because this is hard.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s -- changing our discourse, as I said -- and, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you back to the Michigan speech where the President talked about the fact that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t discourse just for the sake of better discourse.\xc2\xa0 It is -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a means to that end in the sense that if you and I so violently disagree that we, in order to make our arguments, tear each other down, it is impossible at some point to sit down and construct a solution that moves our country forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that just as in a town meeting that the President might do, that there were people that disagreed with the political views of Congresswoman Giffords that were at that meeting to ask her questions.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the great experiment of self-government.\xc2\xa0 But we have to strive to have our discourse played out on a plane that does the discussion of our big problems justice.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where the rubber might meet the road in terms -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking rather philosophically, but in terms of a concrete policy issue, gun control seems to be -- you can\xe2\x80\x99t touch it, especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re a Democrat or a Democratic leader in this town.\xc2\xa0 The assault weapons ban is expired.\xc2\xa0 Apparently, the sort of extended clip that this individual was able to obtain he would not have been able to obtain had it still been in force.\xc2\xa0 Where is the administration on gun control generally, the extension of the assault weapons ban in particular?\xc2\xa0 How hard will you push, considering it\xe2\x80\x99s now considered to be a political loser by Democrats?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mike, let me say this, that obviously we are and have been focused on the important healing process.\xc2\xa0 We will have an opportunity to evaluate ideas and proposals that may be brought forth as a result of circumstances and the facts around this case.\xc2\xa0 The President, again, since I have been with him in 2004, has supported the assault weapons ban, and we continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 And I think we all strive, regardless of party, to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to reduce violence.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to evaluate some of the other proposals.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the conclusions of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commission on the BP Horizon oil spill -- and I find this a little alarming if it\xe2\x80\x99s true, in light of the predictions of $4 gasoline by Memorial Day -- one of the conclusions was that the administration does not have a comprehensive energy plan.\xc2\xa0 It said that there are a lot different programs, grants, et cetera, but no overarching strategy.\xc2\xa0 Would you agree with that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that I would agree with this notion:\xc2\xa0 that you have seen Presidents date back many, many, many administrations discussing our need to take concrete actions to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, to look for and embrace a clean energy economy.\xc2\xa0 We have -- we still have a lot of work to do -- and when I mean \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean the country -- in taking some of those very important steps.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at the investment in the previous two years in -- continued investment in wind energy production, in windmill turbine production, in solar, in, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me discuss on a thousand occasions, increase advanced -- advances in investments in electric batteries for cars, the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken with business and with industry to increase fuel mileage standards not just for cars and not just for light trucks but even for heavier-duty trucks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody would disagree with the notion that there\xe2\x80\x99s still much work left to be done.\xc2\xa0 We still have progress that we need to make so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t find ourselves 10 or 20 or 30 years from now continuing to have the very same debates about how we reduce that influence of foreign oil and our dependence on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to take many forms.\xc2\xa0 Our administration made the first investment in building a new nuclear power plant in more than three decades because there isn\xe2\x80\x99t one thing that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that\xe2\x80\x99s going to fix all this.\xc2\xa0 There are many different approaches.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President -- more specifically as it relates to oil, we have to -- there are certainly -- there\xe2\x80\x99s drilling in the Gulf, there\xe2\x80\x99s drilling in other regions of the United States, and we have to ensure that all of those activities are done with the utmost safety and care.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, if gasoline does indeed get to $4, that\xe2\x80\x99s a threat to this fragile recovery; it\xe2\x80\x99s a big tax on consumers.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you can do about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, there are obviously -- and there are many people that would get upset at me if I started to opine on oil and gas prices, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 But I would say -- you know, look, we are -- we have to continue to take steps to impact the medium and the long term even as we go through the cyclical adjustments that you see year in and year out that are reflected in fluctuating prices.\xc2\xa0 The question is whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get about doing that now or we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to punt some of this year after year after year and find ourselves having this debate and discussion repeatedly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you talk about the need to reduce imported oil, are you referring specifically to the Middle East or our biggest supplier, which is Canada?\xc2\xa0 Is Canadian oil so bad, or who are you referring to?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to dig up some of the quotes.\xc2\xa0 I think that having our fragile economy dependent upon energy that comes from any other place is -- presents its own inherent risks.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a way of increasing our -- adding to the number of jobs that we have in this country and dealing with our energy problems, are all in the same action.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s our hope.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what did the President think about the pep rally aspect and tone of the event last night?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a Tucsonian, obviously, but I think that having been there for a day before the President got there, you could understandably feel the weight of what had happened.\xc2\xa0 And I think part of that -- I think part of the grieving process is celebrating the lives of those that were lost and celebrating the miracles of those that survived.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve all probably by now read the transcript from the two members on the plane last night about their personal experience with the congresswoman in her hospital bed.\xc2\xa0 That -- it\xe2\x80\x99s an emotional thing to read.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think -- I will say that the speech -- I read the speech several times and thought that there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a lot of applause, if any.\xc2\xa0 I think many of us thought that.\xc2\xa0 But I think you -- I think there was a celebration, again, of the lives of those that have been impacted, not just those that -- not just at that grocery store but throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 And I think that if that is part of the healing process, then that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you share with us any words the President said to the parents of Christina?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was not in the room for those, and obviously he had an opportunity to speak with them on the phone a couple of days ago.\xc2\xa0 I think all of us who -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is reserved for parents; I think this is anybody that -- I think anybody that reads that story, it\xe2\x80\x99s a tough story to read.\xc2\xa0 It is a tragedy sort of -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a tragedy beyond any real description.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on the atmosphere?\xc2\xa0 I just want to ask, why was the reason for choosing the arena as opposed to maybe a church or a smaller venue?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point you to the university on that and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand this was -- we were invited to and accepted quite happily the invitation of the university.\xc2\xa0 I think having that many people there and being able to include people from the community was -- again, was and is an important part of that healing process.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of logistics and things like that, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the university as they\xe2\x80\x99d probably be better to answer your questions on those sorts of things.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, going back to China and the answer to Caren\xe2\x80\x99s question, you listed some of the items on the agenda, and it\xe2\x80\x99s quite a full plate.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about whether there are any expectations for decisions made or agreements signed as a result of those talks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Roger, let me -- again, I would point you to a few things.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to talk to Tom tomorrow on some of this.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of the official events of next week.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to what Secretary Geithner said obviously yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I know Secretary Clinton also is going to speak on the topic of China tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t really want to get ahead of that process too much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But for now, based on what you know, can you talk about the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can reiterate that based on what I know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of -- and based on what I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of the official events.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing, the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule is fairly plain today, with the exception of meeting with advisors.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk to us about what else he\xe2\x80\x99s doing?\xc2\xa0 For example, staff appointments, going over --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have his schedule with me.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got a number of meetings today.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not even -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 The President has got -- spends a lot of time here in meetings.\xc2\xa0 I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a regularly planned long NSC meeting later today as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mara.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you said that he has always been for the assault weapons ban.\xc2\xa0 One of the other gun control issues that\xe2\x80\x99s come out of this is seeing if there\xe2\x80\x99s something that could be done to prevent mentally ill people, like the shooter, from purchasing handguns.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xc2\xa0 And has he directed anyone to look into this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Mara, I would leave the legislative proposals -- obviously, as I said earlier, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that evaluation on specific proposals that have been introduced thus far has been done.\xc2\xa0 But we will certainly look at --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, sure.\xc2\xa0 But last night he talked about the importance of like examining our assumptions about issues.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he seemed to almost invite a discussion about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think what the President said was it is important and it is required of us to look at all the facts and the circumstances that surround these events.\xc2\xa0 And I know that\xe2\x80\x99s what law enforcement and investigators are doing on the ground.\xc2\xa0 And I think we all look forward to learning more about what happened and try to explain the why.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he specifically said in order to prevent this from happening again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Mara, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot more than the fact that this is -- evaluation of the facts and how we got to a tragedy like this I think requires us to look at everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting yesterday with the Lebanese prime minister, which occurred just as his government was collapsing.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that the actual statement of getting an indictment in the Hariri massacre of -- the Hariri assassination in 2005 is more important than what comes after, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a collapse of the government or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, look, I, first and foremost, would point you to the readout from the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Again, I was not in the building yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I was in Arizona.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll reiterate what part of that readout says, which is that I think the resignations only demonstrate the fear and the determination that the Hezbollah-led coalition has to block the government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to conduct its business and, most importantly, to get some much-needed answers and justice on the assassination inquiry.\xc2\xa0 Our support is for the sovereignty of the Lebanese people, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to strive toward that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one more about last night\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\xc2\xa0 I know you talked about the personal nature of how the speech was constructed.\xc2\xa0 But what do you think of some of the comparisons that have been drawn between that speech and Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s speech after the Oklahoma City bombing and other tragedy speeches?\xc2\xa0 Are those comparisons overdrawn, or do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s something to it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously there are historians that will weigh in on these topics.\xc2\xa0 Mark, I think there are moments in our history -- Oklahoma City, the Challenger accident, what happened in Arizona -- that are important for the President to talk to the nation about, and to help be part of the process of celebration and healing.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s how he approached -- that\xe2\x80\x99s how he approached this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve had -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve had, and every President does, has unfortunately far too many examples -- a mining accident in West Virginia, a shooting at Fort Hood certainly immediately come to mind as things that the President has had to do.\xc2\xa0 But, look, I think he approached it as -- in his role as President, as somebody that might help to further that healing process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you think of those who say it might have been a turning point in the President\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it was an event, as I said, that affected all of us as Americans, in all reaches of our country, because of the just truly shocking nature of it.\xc2\xa0 And I think our -- I think anybody that holds that office would tell you they\xe2\x80\x99d gladly give up the idea of having to do those speeches if somehow we could figure out how to make sure that senseless tragedies or accidents never happen.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s probably not going to happen, but I think the role that any President can play is to work -- help the country work through questions that -- some of which have simply no answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following your exchange with Ed, do you have any thoughts on the suggestion by Senator Udall that the parties should not sit separately at the State of the Union, they should be --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 George, I saw an article on that.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had an opportunity to talk to some folks around here on that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting idea.\xc2\xa0 I think -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this -- look, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to remove the disagreement in politics.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have debates soon.\xc2\xa0 But, you know, maybe not having a physical aisle separate us is -- would be a good thing as we talk about the state of our union.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s everybody; that\xe2\x80\x99s not one side or the other -- that\xe2\x80\x99s everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it time to move past the sort of pep rally aspect of the modern State of the Union and the dueling standing ovations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you guys have -- some of you guys have been up there in those rooms.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a little -- it gets a little -- it\xe2\x80\x99s like a seesaw.\xc2\xa0 It gets -- you know, I think that -- I think everybody approaches the -- I think we all want to and look to the State of the Union as a very serious and sober discussion of the important challenges that lie ahead.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time to reflect on the strength of our country, the resilience of our citizens in tough times of either war or economic turmoil, but more importantly to chart that course forward.\xc2\xa0 I know that\xe2\x80\x99s the way the President is approaching the construction of and the writing of that speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Christi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A kind of personal question, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, it\xe2\x80\x99s been such a grief-filled week at the White House and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can say anything about how the President has personally wrestled with this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, I think you can -- truthfully, I think that the reflection is in that -- is in what he wrote and what he delivered last night.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he had clergy members in to pray with him or talk with him?**<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on -- I know he gets stuff from Joshua each day on that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s been additional stuff.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll find that answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I also just wonder if there\xe2\x80\x99s been a moment when the President has offered counsel to his own staff.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me find that out, let me -- Glenn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the President has made many speeches about civility and elevating the level of discourse, but the thing that really made it seem to resonate this time, obviously, was the personal aspect of this tragedy, in particular the story of this nine-year-old girl.\xc2\xa0 Do you think his ability to connect on that particular issue has been enhanced by the nature of this tragedy, or did his speech last night reflect a new approach to sharing some more of his emotions in public?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I think you can go back and see -- I think the President has discussed many of these topics on a number of occasions.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt, Glenn, that there\xe2\x80\x99s -- when you are -- when we as a country are forced to confront the realities of a tragedy like that, it provides -- as I think you heard the President discuss, it provides an opportunity for us to reflect on the past, on the present, and on the future.\xc2\xa0 And I think he\xe2\x80\x99s taken an opportunity to once again do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think his hope is that those moments of reflection and our actions that come from it won\xe2\x80\x99t simply be governed by doing so in times of unspeakable tragedy, but will hopefully govern more of our actions on a day-to-day basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as an approach in speaking to the American public.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve read criticism of him in the past in terms of not really being able to empathize with folks and the comparisons between himself and Clinton.\xc2\xa0 Those really went by the wayside last night; this speech had a tremendous emotional impact.\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you think that that will fundamentally --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say -- well, you know, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into political prognosticating.\xc2\xa0 I think the President over the course of his career has done a pretty good job touching on the hopes and the aspirations and the dreams of many in this country.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think yesterday provides an opportunity to reflect.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I think there seems to be agreement across the board about the President touching on civility and healing in his remarks last night, and bipartisanship.\xc2\xa0 Is he aware of and does he have a reaction to some of the comments made in the last week by members of his own party in the other direction, notably Congressman Clyburn making his suggestions about free speech and the nature of it, or Senator Bernie Sanders, including reference to the tragedy in a fundraising letter and suggesting Arizona is unsafe for people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t Republicans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- there are many who can comment on all this.\xc2\xa0 I would simply point you to I think what the President said last night.\xc2\xa0 It was a message that was not reserved for or intended for anybody in particular.\xc2\xa0 It was intended for and I think received by the whole country.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- there are plenty who can play pundit.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not my role.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he aware of those comments from --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a mechanical question.\xc2\xa0 When he first heard about the congresswoman opening her eyes, he heard in the car, did he decide right then to put it in the speech?\xc2\xa0 And how did that work -- did he make a printout, did he decide where -- how did he decide where it went and how to say it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, he -- just to go through the arc of it -- we talked a little bit about this, again, late on the plane but I should do it for everybody who might not have seen that.\xc2\xa0 This happened -- his first stop in the second-floor ICU was in her room, spent about 10 minutes there with members of her family, with her husband.\xc2\xa0 And then goes on throughout the hospital seeing other patients, doctors, nurses, other staff, thanking them for what they had done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The three friends go in -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact time -- and have the exchange and there\xe2\x80\x99s the miracle of opening her eye and of responding to their voices and their memories as they\xe2\x80\x99re talking aloud to her.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President ended by seeing the trauma team that had first received those harmed in the shooting on Saturday, and then got into the car for the very short drive to the McKale Center.\xc2\xa0 In the car, along with the First Lady, was her husband and her mother, and that\xe2\x80\x99s when the President first heard the story and talked to the husband about whether he would be comfortable with sharing that story.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of personal and privacy issues that I think the President wanted to ensure -- he didn\xe2\x80\x99t write any of it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He mentioned to me -- we ended the meetings with the families about nine or 10 minutes before the President went out and in the hold he mentioned to me that at that -- that he would insert that story in the portion of the speech where he discusses how she\xe2\x80\x99s aware that we are all there rooting for her.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s how it all came to pass.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, did you know that Bill Daley gave money Dan Hynes in 2004, and do you think the President cares?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I probably knew that at some point, and, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he cares.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Change subjects?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure -- unless you want to follow up on Dan Hynes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First my condolences to all the Americans, especially obviously to the victims.\xc2\xa0 But second as to why -- it does not seem all that incomprehensible, at least from the outside.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the reverse side of freedom.\xc2\xa0 Unless you want restrictions, unless you want a bigger role for the government --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me do this -- because, look, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- there\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s going to go on -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me -- let me take my time back just for a second.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s going to go on.\xc2\xa0 I think there are -- I think as it goes on, we will learn more and more about what happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think as the President was clear last night, we may never know fully why or how.\xc2\xa0 We may never have an understanding of why, as the President said, in the dark recesses of someone\xe2\x80\x99s mind, a violent person\xe2\x80\x99s mind, do actions like this spring forward.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to surmise or think in the future of what some of that might be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that, as I said earlier, the event that was happening that day was the exercise of some very important, very foundational freedoms to this country:\xc2\xa0 the freedom of speech; the freedom to assemble; the freedom to petition your government; democracy or a form of self-government that is of, by and for the people -- all of -- all very quintessential American values that have been on display along with the tremendous courage and resilience of those in that community and throughout this country that have had to deal with this tragedy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exactly, Robert.\xc2\xa0 But this is what I was talking about -- exactly this.\xc2\xa0 This is America, the democracy, the freedom of speech, the freedom of assembly, the freedom to petition your government.\xc2\xa0 And many people outside would also say -- and the quote, unquote \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom\xe2\x80\x9d of a deranged mind to react in a violent way is also American.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the last part?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The quote, unquote \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom\xe2\x80\x9d of the deranged mind to respect -- to react violently to that, it is also American.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I would disagree vehemently with that.\xc2\xa0 There are -- there is nothing in the values of our country, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing on the many laws on our books that would provide for somebody to impugn and impede on the very freedoms that you began with by exercising the actions that that individual took on that day.\xc2\xa0 That is not American.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s agreement on all sides of the political spectrum:\xc2\xa0 Violence is never, ever acceptable.\xc2\xa0 We had people that died.\xc2\xa0 We had people whose lives will be changed forever because of the deranged actions of a madman.\xc2\xa0 Those are not American.\xc2\xa0 Those are not in keeping with the important bedrock values by which this country was founded and by which its citizens live each and every day of their lives in hopes of something better for those that are here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 11:14 A.M.
