Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t11:03 A.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for being here for this early briefing today.</p>\n<p>\n\tI will be here, obviously, to take your questions on all issues. I have with me today at the top of the briefing the Transportation Secretary, Ray LaHood, because while we\xe2\x80\x99ve been paying attention, for obvious reasons, on one congressional stalemate, there is another one that also affects the economy and jobs, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why Secretary LaHood is here to speak with you. He\xe2\x80\x99ll take some questions afterwards, and then like I said, I will follow him.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I turn the podium over.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Good morning. Since Congress failed to pass an FAA bill, nearly 4,000 FAA employees have been furloughed, and as many as 70,000 construction workers across America are out of work.</p>\n<p>\n\tImportant airport modernization projects have been shut down in every state in the country. And let me just say parenthetically, one of the highest unemployment segments in the country is in the construction area, in the building trades. And for all of my friends on Capitol Hill who give speeches every day about jobs, the importance of jobs, putting people to work, this is not the time to be laying off 70,000 construction workers. These are friends and neighbors to people who live in communities. These are people who work hard -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re right smack dab in the middle of the construction season. This is not the time to be laying off 70,000 people.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have been meeting with and talking to members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, asking them to pass another clean extension of the FAA bill, which they have done on 20 occasions. So they need to come back to the negotiating table; Congress needs to pass a clean bill so our 4,000 FAA employees -- who are without a paycheck since last Saturday -- can come back to work, these construction projects can start again, our friends and neighbors can go back to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think -- if some of you have been paying attention, you know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said we have the safest and the best aviation system in the world. This is not the way to run it, to have 4,000 of our people that run the system not at their desks, not doing their work, and to have these construction projects suspended.</p>\n<p>\n\tTransportation has always been bipartisan. I served on the House Transportation Committee for three terms. It was always bipartisan. It\xe2\x80\x99s always been bipartisan. And I ask Congress in a bipartisan way to come back, pass a clean bill, finish the negotiations, and then get to a bigger FAA bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY: With that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tErica, start with you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Mr. Secretary, do you have any advice to your former House GOP colleagues on dealing with the debt ceiling?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Well, as some of you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in public service and politics 35 years -- 17 years as a staffer, 14 years as a member, and now two and a half years in this job.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring the time that I was a staffer, I was chief of staff for Bob Michel, who served during the time that Ronald Reagan was President and Tip O\xe2\x80\x99Neill was the Speaker of the House. During the time that Tom Foley was Speaker, Bob Michel was also the Republican leader. And during the time that President Clinton was President, Bob Michel was Republican leader. That whole period of time was a very rich history and legacy of compromise.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s how Congress has always solved problems -- through compromise, through people working things out, through people putting aside their own agendas and their own egos, deciding what\xe2\x80\x99s important for the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a time that I think most of us that have watched politics have never seen before, because there are people in Congress who don\xe2\x80\x99t like the word compromise, who don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in it. That\xe2\x80\x99s what we need today. We need for people to come together, set aside their own egos, a certain part of their own agenda for the American people -- to make sure we maintain the strongest economy in the world; to send a signal to the world that we can get big things done, Washington can still get big things done.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is about continuing to have a strong economy and continuing to compromise -- and take maybe a couple chapters out of Tip O\xe2\x80\x99Neill, Bob Michel, Ronald Reagan, President Clinton, people that have served in this town with distinction and gotten big things done through compromise.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Some House Republicans say that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already compromised, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Boehner bill is; it is a compromise.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let Jay --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Come on. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let Jay do his job here. I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to take his job. I\xe2\x80\x99m here to try and put forth a message that in one of the highest unemployment sectors in the country, where we have friends and neighbors all over the country that are out of work during the construction season -- they ought to go back to work. They shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be held hostage. These projects shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be held hostage. And we have 4,000 FAA employees -- hardworking people who come to work every day and do their jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Can you explain what the bottleneck is on the FAA bill, from your perspective?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Yes, certainly I can. It\xe2\x80\x99s the idea that there\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of provisions that could probably be worked out if they would pass a clean extension again, as they\xe2\x80\x99ve done on 20 other occasions, as Congresses always have done, that could probably be worked out I think within the next 30 days.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn my discussions with people in leadership in both the Senate and House, they believe the labor issue and the Essential Air Service issue, those are probably the two big issues -- there are a few little ones -- probably could be worked out over the next 30 days. And that\xe2\x80\x99s really what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying to members of Congress: Don\xe2\x80\x99t hold hostage common, ordinary citizens who want to work, who want to do construction jobs, who make their living doing that, and are FAA employees. It\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not the way -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not really the way to run the best aviation system in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Mr. Secretary, without the FAA there, there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody to collect the federal tax on airline tickets. So what\xe2\x80\x99s happening to that money? Is it going back to customers and consumers?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Well, I have talked to the largest aviation association here in Washington that represents all the airlines, and I have told them that I am not happy about the fact they continue to add to citizens\xe2\x80\x99 ticket price -- now, these are people who are planning vacations, who are planning to fly, people who live on a budget. They\xe2\x80\x99re collecting this money and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to their bottom line, and I think that is not right. And I simply think it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair for them to do that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve made that known to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the airlines should not be collecting this amount of money under the umbrella that it\xe2\x80\x99s a tax. It\xe2\x80\x99s not. They shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be collecting it, and they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be adding it on to passengers\xe2\x80\x99 price of a ticket.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ It\xe2\x80\x99s not their money. I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s theft, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? If they\xe2\x80\x99re taking money that\xe2\x80\x99s due the federal government and putting in their pocket?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Well, look, Treasury is working on this and we\xe2\x80\x99re working with Treasury on it. And the important point is here, passengers shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be paying this particular amount of money. They shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tDave.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Mr. Secretary, can you talk about the deal that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be announced tomorrow between the auto companies and the administration to hike fuel-efficiency standards?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Well, if I want to keep my job the last thing I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do is talk about what the President is going to talk about tomorrow. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Come on.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: You know, I know that maybe I don\xe2\x80\x99t look very smart, but I have survived 35 years around here. Stay tuned, Dave.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Mr. Secretary, thank you. You are smart. You\xe2\x80\x99re doing a good job.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Oh, thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ My question is, Mr. Secretary: As far as the international partners are concerned, what are you hearing from them as far as security is concerned? And also, U.S. and India had some agreement on aviation and on obviously -- where we do stand?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: I\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to talk to you offline on this. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there are very many other people in this room that care about India-U.S. relationships when it comes to aviation, which, by the way, is pretty good.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnybody else on this subject?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Yes, on the aviation subject, sir. To what extent do you think it has been caught up in the tone and the rough and tumble of the overall debt ceiling hassle?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: You know, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. I don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to believe it has, because when I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to members of Congress, particularly those that are in leadership, this really is I think some people\xe2\x80\x99s way of saying that these two issues that I mentioned, the EAS, the Essential Air Service, and the union provision, they want to get to those. They want to get them solved.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it can be done with a clean bill, another extension. I think it could be done very quickly with the discussions I\xe2\x80\x99ve had with people in leadership in the House and Senate. And I hope that -- I really hope that will happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Given the current situation, is there any hope that your issue is going to be handled before they deal with the debt ceiling issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Debt and deficit are center stage.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Mr. Secretary, one more on the aviation windfall. Which airlines have you talked to? And second, does -- do you or does the government have the power to order a refund?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Under deregulation we can\xe2\x80\x99t set ticket prices, okay? So we can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. We\xe2\x80\x99re talking with our friends and colleagues in Treasury about the way forward and how we figure out what happens with this money.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ So there\xe2\x80\x99s not a chance of a refund?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that. We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to figure that out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Okay. Which airlines did you talk to?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to a number of airlines, but more importantly, I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to the air transportation -- or the Aviation Transportation Association, which represents most of the airlines. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to some of the airlines personally about this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ And they have names?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: You know what their names are. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ If I could ask, as a former congressman, a Republican congressman, and before that in the Reagan era the chief of staff to the House Republican leader, could you comment on this debt limit impasse and whether you think your colleagues -- or successors in the House Republican caucus should have accepted the deal that was on the table with the President and Mr. Boehner?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that aspect of it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve probably said pretty much what I want to say about this. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave the details to Jay and others that work in government affairs to do that. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Mr. Secretary?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ At what point does the FAA impasse become a public safety issue, or could it possibly?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: There is no public safety issue here. Flying is safe. Air-traffic controllers all over America went to work today. They\xe2\x80\x99re guiding planes in and out of airports. Thousands of people will board planes all day today, fly all over America and all over the world. Safety is not compromised.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, frankly, the flying public\xe2\x80\x99s travel plans will not be compromised. The people that have been furloughed, the 4,000 people, are people who are working on next-generation technology research and things like that. So safety is not compromised.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Do you have an estimate on the revenue loss from this?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: In terms of the tax? Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s about -- it\xe2\x80\x99s about $200 billion a month.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Two hundred billion dollars a month?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Two hundred million dollars a month. All right. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to restart. (Laughter.) Two hundred million dollars a week -- is that right? All right, blame Jill if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me go back to this gentleman.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Will that money have to be made up? Is that going to put a crimp in financing for future aviation projects? I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair amount of money you\xe2\x80\x99ll be losing.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: It\xe2\x80\x99s -- you know what it is? It\xe2\x80\x99s real money to the treasury. For all the talk around here and debt and deficit, that money is being lost to the treasury. And we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to figure out if it can be made up or not. So for people who really care about debt and deficit, pass a clean bill, let\xe2\x80\x99s get back on track, let\xe2\x80\x99s get our workers back to work, let\xe2\x80\x99s get construction projects going again, and let\xe2\x80\x99s start collecting the tax that goes into the federal treasury.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat it, Jay? Look, I know you want me to stay up here a lot longer than -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: I am so happy you\xe2\x80\x99re here.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Yes, I know. (Laughter.) There\xe2\x80\x99s two reasons for me to be here -- so he can relax a little bit -- okay, you get the last question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Thank you. I know you said you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to Treasury. Is there any way to get -- retroactively get the money back?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY LaHOOD: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking to Treasury about. We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to figure this out.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is complicated and we want to -- first of all, we want to do right by passengers. That\xe2\x80\x99s number one. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to the airlines and to the ATA. And secondly, we want to make sure, legally, where this takes us, because a lot of money is being lost to the treasury.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you all very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Okay. Just want to be clear for Jackie that the Secretary did address your question, so you can look for that answer.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to other topics, I assume.</p>\n<p>\n\tErica.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Plouffe said today that \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s an easy compromise here.\xe2\x80\x9d Can you describe what that looks like?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: The senator -- the bill that Senator Reid has put forward cuts spending significantly -- cuts spending significantly more than the measure that\xe2\x80\x99s currently in the House. It also sets up a process, as the measure in the House does, to create a committee in Congress that would address the issues that would be lost in this if we can\xe2\x80\x99t get a grand bargain at this moment, which are the tough issues of tax reform and entitlement reform, and it would create a mechanism by which that committee would produce a product that would have fast-track status and an up or down vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it would be -- it is in the interest of all parties, and certainly this President, that Congress does take action. In fact, the committee, if it\xe2\x80\x99s set up through this mechanism, could use, and should use, that as a starting point -- a product that will get them very far down the road if they\xe2\x80\x99re looking to find a balanced approach towards further deficit reduction through looking at entitlement spending and spending in the tax code. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the plan and the compromise that was close to fruition, that was being worked on for so long by the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, and the President of the United States -- the Obama-Boehner plan, if you will.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is a product that provides a lot of guideposts to how you get to a bipartisan compromise on those tough issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, really, if we can\xe2\x80\x99t get that grand bargain -- let me start. We still believe that\xe2\x80\x99s possible, that deal is on the table. If there is the political will to make it happen, it could happen before August 2nd. If that isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible before August 2nd, there are certainly -- what a compromise looks like is pretty clear: significant deficit reduction, a mechanism by which Congress would take on the tough issues of tax reform and entitlement reform, and a lifting of the debt ceiling beyond -- into 2013, so that we do not have the cloud of uncertainty that is hanging over our economy right now and getting darker and stormier as every day passes for another three months, four months, five months, six months, 10 months.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have to -- our primary objective here has to be to protect the economy and protect the American people from economic harm. So if everyone has that objective in mind as we move forward, compromise is pretty easy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ And could you clarify, yesterday you said that Treasury would detail prior to August 2nd who would get paid, who not, in event of a default.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Well, let me -- I appreciate the question and I want to clarify what I said. I did -- I think Mark was sitting over there in the radio seat and he asked a lot of questions, and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwell said,\xe2\x80\x9d and I implied things -- levels of specifics that I did not mean to. What I can tell you is that as we get closer to that date the Treasury Department will explain how it will manage a situation that is essentially an impossible situation. I refer you to Treasury for how that will look, but I think they will explain that when that time comes. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more specifics than that.</p>\n<p>\n\tCaren.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Just to follow up on that, are you saying that you will prioritize the debt if you have to?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Look, I am saying that -- two things: First, we continue to believe and remain optimistic that Congress will come to its senses, that cooler heads will prevail, and that a compromise will be achieved. As I just spelled out, it really isn\xe2\x80\x99t that complicated at this point. What we need to do is get beyond voting on dead-on-arrival measures that aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to become law when we have so few days left to reach a compromise. We need to get that kind of political theater out of our system and get to work on something that can actually pass both houses with bipartisan support and be signed by the President. We believe that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is a matter of due diligence and responsible governance that Treasury will -- if we approach that date, as we get closer to that date -- explain how it would manage a situation that would be created by the failure of Congress to act, and would create a situation where for the first time in our history we have lost our borrowing authority and risk default. I leave it to them to -- and to them, and at that time to give further details on that process.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ You just said you think there will ultimately be a deal. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying that all week. Do you think that -- are you equally as confident that a downgrade of the credit rating can be avoided?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s what I know, is that we control -- we in Washington -- and in particular in this case Congress -- controls our fate as regards whether or not we will lift the debt ceiling and allow the United States to continue to pay its bills and meet its obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe rating agencies are obviously independent and it is up to them. What we can do is take actions that make clear that the United States is still the gold standard when it comes to investments; that it is the safest of safe harbors, as it has been for 100 years or more, and -- because Washington functions and can compromise and can do the right thing by the economy. We do that and we think that will help enormously in terms of how international investors look at the United States and our treasuries as a potential place to put their money.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ What about staying in contact with the rating agencies? Is that something that you\xe2\x80\x99re doing on a daily basis at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have any information on that. I would refer you to Treasury Department for that. I think Treasury is the right place to answer that question. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any contact that we have here.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Republicans in the House say that they\xe2\x80\x99re voting for a compromise; Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s bill is a compromise.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Then what is the compromise that is inside of it?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak for them --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ -- but I can tell you that they say that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cut as much as they want, it raises the debt ceiling. It does a number of things that they\xe2\x80\x99re not in favor of. They would like deeper cuts. And some members of Congress obviously don\xe2\x80\x99t want to raise the debt ceiling at all.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if that is their attitude, why are you confident that Speaker Boehner can compromise any more? The President has spoken extensively about the difficulty Boehner has with his caucus.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: We\xe2\x80\x99re confident because, Jake, we believe that the American people have made clear that they want a compromise. They are so frustrated by what they see as dysfunction here, as unnecessary fighting over issues that could be and should be easily resolved. They want to see Washington work on the problems that affect them directly. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see Washington, because of partisan and political posturing, do things that actually hurt them economically.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there is no question that if Congress does not compromise and does not act, that allowing the United States to default for the first time in its history would have severe economic consequences and would -- everyone, every family that owns a home and has a mortgage would be affected. Every American who has a car and a car payment would be affected; a student loan, a credit card. And that\xe2\x80\x99s just the beginning of the terrible consequences for individuals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ All of those facts have been true for months.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: That is -- well, and Congress has a way of waiting until the last minute to do the right thing. We remain confident that it will.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, look, I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99ve said a lot of other things. If they think this is compromise, they\xe2\x80\x99ve said, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard today, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s stick it to him,\xe2\x80\x9d or let\xe2\x80\x99s -- the Speaker of the House said yesterday that his alleged bipartisan compromise bill is hated by the President, hated by the Minority Leader in the House and hated by the Majority Leader in the Senate. I think that demonstrates their view on whether or not this is a compromise. The truth of the matter is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite clear about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, politics is part of this town. We understand that. We participate in it. And some of these things happen because they have to happen, part of the political process. But we are now at a moment where those Americans who were elected to represent people in their home districts and states need to decide about what is the greater good here. Is it holding out to get exactly what you want -- holding out for a bill, by the way, that creates a mechanism that would force the adoption of draconian cuts more severe than are in the Ryan budget that was rejected already by Congress and overwhelmingly opposed by the American people, or is it a compromise where nobody gets everything they want, but the cloud of uncertainty on our economy is lifted and we make some significant cuts in our deficit and set up a mechanism to do even more. I think that is the compromise that people are looking for, and I believe, we believe, the President believes, that in the end, that\xe2\x80\x99s the compromise we will get.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the Boehner bill better than nothing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: We don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that nothing is -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a false choice. Nothing is not what will be the alternative here. Compromise will be the alternative. Everyone in this town -- rather, everyone who was elected in this town is on the hook for the economy. Everyone will have to answer to his or her constituents about what they did. Where were they when decisions were made about whether or not to allow the United States to default, whether or not to allow everybody\xe2\x80\x99s interest rates to go up, whether or not to allow a situation that would severely impact the ability of the economy to create jobs?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think, in the end, enough members of Congress of both parties will say, we have to do the right thing here even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not the ideal thing, and they will get it done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Is there any negotiation going on specifically between Vice President Biden and the Senate Republican leader about what happens when and if the Senate rejects the Boehner bill? What happens then?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Well, the Senate will reject the Boehner bill, but the -- as has been made clear by not just Democrats but a number of Republicans who reject the Boehner bill in the Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Because it\xe2\x80\x99s too liberal.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: They reject it, okay? So there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that this bill is a political act that has no life beyond its current existence in the House.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are having conversations at every level. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to detail the individuals who are talking to members, but you can be sure that members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s team are continuing the conversations that we have been having for weeks -- and months, even. And that goes on every day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ But there is a plan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Look, there are a variety of ways to achieve a compromise here. And we are obviously, as are members and leaders of Congress, engaged in discussions about what those plans look like and what the best way forward will be as the clock clicks down here -- ticks down. Sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Dan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Thank you. Plouffe this morning, and also Dan Pfeiffer tweeting, were talking about the Boehner bill and how it would mean dealing with the debt ceiling over the Christmas holiday season, which is an important time for the economy. Is this new narrative then suggesting that the administration would embrace some sort of two-stage plan if it\xe2\x80\x99s past the holiday season?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: No. We have always said that we need to extend this into 2013. Now, there are mechanisms -- Mitch McConnell, speaking of the Republican Senate leader, had a proposal that would have created cycles of lifting the debt ceiling but it would have made clear -- the whole idea of his proposal was to ensure that the debt ceiling -- there would be no doubt that the debt ceiling would continue to be raised in order for the United States to pay its bills into 2013.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are different ways to do this. Our objection is to -- any proposal that puts us through this three-ring circus again in any short period of time -- because it\xe2\x80\x99s already had significant negative impact on the economy -- it will only have even more and more severe negative impact on the economy. The reason why we talk about the holiday season is because, as constructed now, the measure that the Speaker of the House has put forward would almost certainly require this -- all of us to go through this again before the end of the year, in the most important economic season in the country and at a time when people don\xe2\x80\x99t want to worry about whether or not their interest rates are going to go up, their mortgage payments and their car payments and their student loan bills and their credit card payments, especially as they\xe2\x80\x99re buying gifts for the holidays.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf we care about the economy, how could that possibly be the answer? It\xe2\x80\x99s not. So we are opposed to that, for economic reasons -- not political reasons, for economic reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause one thing that\xe2\x80\x99s clear, Dan, is -- on the suggestion that this is about politics -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody in this room who\xe2\x80\x99s looked at a poll could argue with the idea that we\xe2\x80\x99re winning this argument on the merits as a political matter. But you know what, the President is not here to win political arguments. He\xe2\x80\x99s here to make sure that the economy is protected and the American people are protected. This is too serious a matter. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get this done and do it in a way that does not further harm the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ So you\xe2\x80\x99re admitting that you\xe2\x80\x99re losing the argument?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: No, I just -- didn\xe2\x80\x99t I just say we were winning it? That was the verb I used, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Did you say -- okay, sorry. (Laughter.) Okay. When you talk about these conversations --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: I\xe2\x80\x99m tired, but not that tired. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ When you talk about these conversations that are ongoing, are we talking about negotiations here, or just talks, just back-and-forth phone calls? Anything serious being negotiated behind the scenes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: I think every conversation we have about this issue with every member of Congress and every key staffer in Congress is serious. And it\xe2\x80\x99s about -- and when it\xe2\x80\x99s about this issue it is obviously part of negotiations. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more to tell you about specific ideas being traded or plans or proposals, just that you can be sure that we continue to have conversations. Even as the House goes through this exercise that will not bring us any closer to compromise, because time is so tight we are obviously continuing to have conversations with folks on the Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\tNorah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Jay, will we hear from the President after the vote is taken in the House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling announcements to make about the President. And as you know, in this process we have -- the President has come before you many times both to take your questions and to make statements, and on the occasion Monday night to speak to the nation directly during primetime. So anything is possible, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Does the President still want to be part of the debate, or has he pretty much said now it\xe2\x80\x99s Congress\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: No, I think that -- first of all, he has been very visible in this, calling meetings, coming out and talking to you. The fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s not standing here in front of you I can assure you does not mean he\xe2\x80\x99s not intensely engaged in this debate, because of his responsibilities, because of what he thinks is most important, which is that we ensure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t do anything that hurts the economy, that affects growth and job creation. So he is absolutely engaged.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ What does the President and officials here believe that they\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved in this debt ceiling negotiations? The current bill that\xe2\x80\x99s being considered in the House and may become the vehicle in the Senate does not include tax revenues, it does not include the size of cuts that he\xe2\x80\x99d like, does not include the types of agreements on long-term entitlement changes. So what does the administration feel it\xe2\x80\x99s achieved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Well, we certainly haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten an end result. The President\xe2\x80\x99s primary goal here is that, at the very least -- and he said this several weeks ago -- we make sure that we lift the cloud that\xe2\x80\x99s hanging over our economy and ensure that the United States does not default.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was a real and serious opportunity to do something far more significant. And as most of you here know, there was an immense amount of detail attached to the proposals that the President and the Speaker were passing back and forth.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere really is an opportunity here -- if there is political will, there is a real opportunity here to do something significant -- politically hard, but significant -- and politically hard for Democrats and Republicans. And I know that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people want and expect.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that -- however this short-term process ends, if you will, before August 2nd, whatever compromise we reach to life that cloud, to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re locking in some significant deficit reduction, this conversation will continue, because what those -- in spite of the fact that the Speaker walked away from the negotiations twice, they did outline together real areas of potential compromise for doing something significant, for tackling our deficits and debt in a way that would strengthen our economy, put our fiscal house in order, strengthen our entitlement programs, simplify our tax code -- a lot of really hard, good things. And the President will keep fighting to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ You\xe2\x80\x99ve used the metaphor before about trains heading into the station. It seems like the only train heading into the station right now is the Boehner bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely false, because there is a -- the Senate Majority Leader has a bill that significantly cuts deficits more, reduces spending more -- you\xe2\x80\x99re right, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include tax increases or any revenues in it up front. And if you were a Republican, you might say, well, gosh, that looks like a compromise to me in my direction. The size of the cuts, you might say, well, gosh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a compromise. The Democrats have moved towards us on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact that it allows for this dollar-for-dollar requirement that is completely confected, but has created a hostage situation in terms of our economy, it even does that. You might, if you were reasonable, say -- as a Republican say, you know what, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get everything I wanted out of this but I got a lot, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, what I know about the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s proposal in the House right now is that there are already, I believe, 55, 56, 57, 58 senators -- Democrats and Republicans -- who oppose it. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere in the United States Senate. So we need to start doing things that actually can pass both houses and be signed into law.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ So on that, is one of the trains heading into the station -- I just was surprised to hear you talk about the grand bargain again -- that that\xe2\x80\x99s now back on the table?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: It\xe2\x80\x99s never been off the table. Well, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question. It\xe2\x80\x99s never been off the table.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ The President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the Speaker in several days.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: How do you know?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Has he?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to detail conversations or name individuals. All I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is the President was at the table, the potential agreement was on the table, the grand bargain, and the Speaker walked away from the table over an issue that can be resolved quite easily.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf the political will is there, we can move back to those negotiations. If that isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible in the next five days, then there are ways that we can resolve this issue in a fair compromise that does the keys things, which is lock in significant cuts and lift the cloud over our economy and ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not playing in this three-ring circus for the next six months.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ This will just be a stab and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll let others have a chance. But are you just raising that just sort of as a Hail Mary pass, or -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s -- could you give us any indication that that\xe2\x80\x99s really any -- alive at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Well, look, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated, and I will say it explicitly, that the chances aren\xe2\x80\x99t great that we end up between now and August 2nd with a sweeping grand compromise between the Republicans and Democrats that reduces the deficit $3 trillion to $4 trillion over 10 years, includes balance between entitlement reform and tax reform. That\xe2\x80\x99s not likely, but it\xe2\x80\x99s available if the political will is there.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the short term, there are other options to do what we need to do at the bare minimum and then we can return in a serious way to tax reform and entitlement reform.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Henry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Thank you, Jay. I want to follow on Jake, because when he asked you whether the Boehner bill is better than nothing you seemed to indicate it\xe2\x80\x99s not better than nothing. So I want to know what is the President willing to put on the table in these final hours if we\xe2\x80\x99re really in such a desperate situation --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Well, I want to be --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ -- will he give on spending cuts? Will he give on having a debt ceiling vote early next year? What is he willing to put on the table now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Well, I appreciate the question. Absent a willingness to do something big and historic on the part of the Speaker and other Republicans, our bill is -- we have indicated pretty strongly our support for Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s bill. And what is he willing to do? He\xe2\x80\x99s willing to take the cuts put forward in Senator -- Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s bill and increase them dramatically, which is what is in the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s -- in the Senate Majority Leader\xe2\x80\x99s bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99s willing to allow for a mechanism, which he thinks is very important, that if we can\xe2\x80\x99t get the grand bargain now, that would make it a time-specific period where this committee would consider these options. He will hand over the reams of paper to that committee that could form the basis of serious entitlement reform and tax reform in a bipartisan way, and certainly is willing to consider measures that are enforcement mechanisms to move that process forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat he is not willing to do is allow this obviously damaging situation -- damaging to our economy -- continue. People have asked -- and I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember if it was you or others -- about a previous vote; the fact that under previous Presidents there have been numerous votes to raise the debt ceiling. And the fact is, while these votes were often unpleasant for Congress they were routine. And we never had a situation like this where -- there were sometimes confrontations over this, and I read from the letter from President Reagan -- but the overwhelming number of times is the -- Congress acted because this was not a question. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t this one-for-one thing. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the question that I am going to blow up the economy, if you will, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t do what I want. It\xe2\x80\x99s just crazy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ But what I hear you saying is he\xe2\x80\x99s still not happy with the Boehner bill, you want the Reid bill. But if the Reid bill is not able to get through the House and all you have to sign is some version of the Boehner bill, are you now saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s still willing to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: But the Boehner bill won\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ -- hold on, but he\xe2\x80\x99s still willing to veto it, and basically all these awful consequences you\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out -- maybe a stock market crash, all these other things -- he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to let all that happen --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Well, I understand one of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s come out of the House conference is this desire to stand firm and then stick the President with default, I think is one quote that came out of there, which is really incredibly juvenile, right? Is this the game that the idea here is who can be blamed for doing serious harm for our economy? Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the idea be, what can we do to compromise to make sure that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst of all, the bill being considered in the House cannot be an option because it will not pass the Senate, so it\xe2\x80\x99s dead on arrival.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ But you won\xe2\x80\x99t know that until it goes to the Senate floor.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Well, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it can\xe2\x80\x99t pass the House before Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s measure is voted on. And you don\xe2\x80\x99t know that, until the votes happen, that it won\xe2\x80\x99t emerge as a viable option.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ This weekend, Boehner may be the last thing standing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Well, a lot of things may happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ So if it\xe2\x80\x99s Boehner bill or default, you\xe2\x80\x99ll go default.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear how we feel about the Boehner bill, the Speaker Boehner bill, because it is incredibly bad for the economy to have this kind of circus to go on in Washington with folks saying that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to force default; we will not let the United States pay its bills unless you do what we want, unless you enact spending cuts that were rejected already that are more draconian than are in the Ryan bill that would do significant damage to Social Security and Medicare; force incredible cuts in education and clean energy programs -- all these sorts of things, all those things that nobody -- nothing close to a majority supported and certainly not in the country. Otherwise, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just default. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a mechanism that is good for us, good for the economy, good for the American people. So that\xe2\x80\x99s what we oppose.</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond that, there are a lot of ways to get to compromise here and that is what the American people, I think, really want us to do is to compromise, not stick it to anybody, not score political victories and see who can be blamed for the economic damage that would be done by the fight here. People want these fights to result in -- they\xe2\x80\x99re happy to have -- because they vote every two years, every four years for President and obviously people feel strongly that they send representatives to Congress with points of view and they want those points of view to be expressed and to guide votes. But in the end, they want the fights to result in good things, not bad things.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Last thing, in the 2008 campaign as a candidate, the President said if he\xe2\x80\x99s elected, he\xe2\x80\x99d put the health care negotiations on C-SPAN. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, but he got the health care reform through. And he later told \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d that he regretted it. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a price to that. People then felt like what\xe2\x80\x99s going on behind closed doors isn\xe2\x80\x99t so good for us. I think it hurt us politically.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last couple of days you seem to be arguing that it\xe2\x80\x99s better to do these things behind closed doors, because if it\xe2\x80\x99s all public, interest groups are going to blow it up, right? So do you have any regrets now that we\xe2\x80\x99re at this precipice that -- the President has put some details on the table, but if you had put more of the details on the table earlier, you might be further along in this process because it would have been more transparent?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Well, I appreciate the question. And the answer is no, because if the President had gone into a room and said, here\xe2\x80\x99s my bipartisan compromise, guess who would not have been in the room with him? A Republican leader, okay? And his interest in the end was to sit down with the Speaker of the House and other Republican leaders, Majority Leader Cantor as well, and try to work out a deal -- and understanding that this was politically hard and that the only kind of compromise you could achieve would be one that was reached between the leaders and then presented to members of Congress of both parties to evaluate. And then those who were the architects of the deal could say, here\xe2\x80\x99s why we think it is not perfect, but on balance the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re a veteran Washington reporter. There are a lot of you here. And I think we all understand how that works, that if you lay out a proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s politically -- by yourself that\xe2\x80\x99s extremely politically hard for your party, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re Republican or Democrat, it\xe2\x80\x99s like putting a clay pigeon in the air. It\xe2\x80\x99s ensuring its defeat. And that\xe2\x80\x99s -- and maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s a sad statement, perhaps, about how Washington works, but it\xe2\x80\x99s an incredibly realistic statement about how Washington works.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact of the matter now, Ed -- and you and I have talked about this and others -- is there is no plan that has been offered, certainly in the last several months, about which more detail is known or has been specified than the Obama-Boehner plan, okay, in terms of the cuts in domestic spending, both defense and non-defense discretionary; the savings coming out of entitlements programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security; the kind of tax reform that was envisioned and the mechanisms by which tax revenue would be a hard thing for Republicans to accept but was part of the deal -- that would be $800 billion, that would be part of this proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tEverybody knows these details. There is -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s not that people are hiding the details of the Boehner plan or the Reid plan, it\xe2\x80\x99s just there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot less to them than the plan that was worked on by the President and the Speaker of the House, and now, in the aftermath, the details of which are very well known by so many people.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ You say everybody is on the hook for how they behave in their votes on the economy and on this plan. Does default inevitably arise if the debt ceiling is not lifted?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: What happens if the debt ceiling is not lifted is that we lose our borrowing authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ But that\xe2\x80\x99s different from default.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Correct. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this -- I will at some point refer you to the transcript yesterday. But what happens then is that we no longer have the ability to borrow money, but we have bills coming due and a limited amount of cash in our pockets. Even as money flows in -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no question because revenue flows in -- it will not even come close to being enough to pay our bills. And that leads to a process of default. How quick that is depends on a lot of different factors, and I refer you to Treasury.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this is not --the moment that we send the signal that the United States government has ceased -- no longer has the ability to borrow money but has bills that, for every dollar we have in a bill we only have 60 cents to pay, you\xe2\x80\x99ve created essentially a crisis situation -- what we\xe2\x80\x99ve described as an impossible situation -- that leads to horrendous choices about how we go about paying our bills and making choices about which bills to pay and which not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ I\xe2\x80\x99m going to follow up -- in your answer to Erica, I thought it was interesting the way you phrased it. Last week or maybe in the week --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: If it was interesting it was probably unintentional. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Last week or the week before you indicated that if they\xe2\x80\x99re close to compromise, if it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of crossing the t\xe2\x80\x99s, dotting the i\xe2\x80\x99s, then the President would go along with a short-term extension and not let process get in the way of an agreement. And then you said that the basis of a compromise is already there. Are we at the point where the President would agree to a short-term extension beyond August 2nd? And what -- if not, what is the threshold?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: We are not at that point. We are not at that point. The fact is there is -- what a compromise would look like, if you\xe2\x80\x99re lowering your sights and accepting that you can\xe2\x80\x99t get a grand bargain, is clear, and it requires us to get through our system the votes on bills that can\xe2\x80\x99t pass, and then look at what can pass in a bipartisan way through the House and the Senate on the pretty simple measures that are out there -- that would involve, basically, targets for -- real numbers, but targets, unspecified discretionary spending cuts, and mechanisms to create a committee to allow for, hopefully, further reductions through entitlement reform and tax reform.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we remain confident that as these hours churn on and the days go by that we will get to that point and that compromise will be reached. But it is -- we are not the only actor in this play and we need to make sure that others understand the stakes and are willing to reach that compromise. We\xe2\x80\x99re confident they will.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Okay. And finally, you say this is a matter of economics, not politics; you\xe2\x80\x99re wanting to avoid another vote on raising the debt limit around Christmas or whenever it is that the Boehner plan would necessitate a vote. But one of the agreements that\xe2\x80\x99s been on the table in virtually every compromise or every plan out there is for this super committee to come up with a way to handle entitlements and overhaul -- a comprehensive overhaul of the tax code by a date certain. That\xe2\x80\x99s no garden party right there. I mean, that would be an intense debate around the same time that would speak to the government\xe2\x80\x99s ability, much like the debate we\xe2\x80\x99re having now, to handle debt and tell the world and the rating agencies and the markets and everybody else --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: No question. And we would hope that a bipartisan consensus and majority would be created out of that process to do something big and historic. It would be hard --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ As wrenching as everything we\xe2\x80\x99re going through now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: No, no, no, not as wrenching as the potential for default for the first time in our history. And that is the key. We cannot link the successful passage of further spending reductions through that process to raising the debt ceiling again, precisely for the reason that you just enumerated -- the reasons you just enumerated. We cannot hold the American economy hostage to that process.</p>\n<p>\n\tMembers of Congress were sent here to make hard decisions and get things done, right? And they should be able to do that. And, look, we are open to, and have always been open to -- and this was also part of some of the discussions that the President had -- to mechanisms, enforcement mechanism, to force Congress, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s through a committee or other means, to act on measures that would create more deficit reduction -- measures -- entitlement reform and tax reform being the toughest ones. We are very much in favor of that because we want the kind of Damocles sword hanging over Congress to force it to make a decision and act.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat that enforcement mechanism cannot and -- should not and cannot be is if you don\xe2\x80\x99t do this we won\xe2\x80\x99t extend the borrowing authority of the United States, again -- so we go through this whole process again with all the resulting damage done to the economy, the uncertainty it creates -- uncertainty, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been told, and we agree, by so many people from so many political persuasions, is the number one thing that affects -- that dampens economic growth or decisions made by private businesses about how are they going to invest and the kind of -- how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to hire.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is nothing comparable to the kind of uncertainty that this has created. So let\xe2\x80\x99s get rid of it and move on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Can I just follow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Let me get around here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Two quick ones.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ On the prioritization, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it too late to wait until Monday for people to understand really -- I mean, enough time for people who get Social Security checks and veteran checks to know --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I have exhausted my ability to talk about that. I just refer you to Treasury.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the answer about what is going to be prioritized. But isn\xe2\x80\x99t just the fact that we may not know until Monday what\xe2\x80\x99s going --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d just refer you to the Treasury Department for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Okay. And then on the grand bargain real quick, you had said that -- even today and also last week -- that this is easily solvable. Can you just tease out what you mean by the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s easily solvable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: The differences that -- because of the serious and good-faith work that was done, the differences that remain on the table could be resolved. And what the President I believe said to you from here on Friday is that he never issued any ultimatums. If there was something on the table that was unlivable then we can work it out. And that was true -- that\xe2\x80\x99s $400 billion that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. And that was certainly true with the last-minute insertion in this process, going back to triggers, of, oh, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a trigger of -- use the individual mandate as a trigger -- if Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do that, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll just remove the individual mandate.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the hypocrisy of that, besides being obviously political, is that that actually increases the deficit, right, because as CBO has scored, the individual mandate reduces spending, reduces the deficit.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut these were not -- these were things that we could talk about. Okay, you can\xe2\x80\x99t live with this? We can\xe2\x80\x99t live with this? Let\xe2\x80\x99s -- we have done so much negotiating here and come so close, let\xe2\x80\x99s get to the end here, and we can do that. And what happened is there was not a willingness to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ So you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to take the $400 billion --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to negotiate the specifics here, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve made pretty clear that we are willing to talk about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ve got about two more minutes because I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go see the boss.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Following up on a question you said you\xe2\x80\x99d check into yesterday -- speaking of the boss. Has he consulted with other Presidents who have faced this same thing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: You know, I apologize, I did not get an answer to that question. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll see --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Can you post it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ A quick one. The President said the other night the whole world is watching. There are many concerns abroad, Jay. Why is the President not viewing this as a national security issue, basically take it into his own hands and stop the political wrangling once and for all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Because Congress has the authority to raise the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ But he has plenty of authority himself, does he not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Well, he certainly does. He\xe2\x80\x99s President of the United States. But the fact is that the -- it is Congress that has to act to ensure that Congress pays its bills -- or that the bills that Congress ran up are paid. So that\xe2\x80\x99s the process. That\xe2\x80\x99s the country we live in.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is my last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ One quick one. Once the House votes, why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the President call everybody back here and get them back to the table?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling announcements to make, but thanks for asking. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tSee you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:57 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
