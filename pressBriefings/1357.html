CARROLL:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.\xc2\xa0 On the call today we have Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen; we have Nashville Mayor Karl Dean; FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate; and Red Cross Senior Vice President for Disaster Services Joe Becker.</p>\n<p>As you know, the President has declared a major disaster for the state of Tennessee, and FEMA personnel are currently on the ground as part of the state\xe2\x80\x99s response and recovery effort.\xc2\xa0 And FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate is actually making his second trip to Tennessee and FEMA personnel went down in support today.</p>\n<p>Governor, I\'m going to turn the call over to you.</p>\n<p>GOVERNOR BREDESEN:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And thank you all for joining us here.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had here in Tennessee -- we\'re speaking from Nashville, which was very hard hit, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve had across the state a lot of communities that have been hit by some very hard flooding.\xc2\xa0 These are -- the range we experienced this last weekend were just completely the black swan of weather events, just something completely unanticipated, unlike anything we\'ve ever seen here before.</p>\n<p>I think that from the standpoint of some of you on the call, this thing that happened in Tennessee was sandwiched between everything that was going on in the Gulf and what was happening up in New York, and maybe it didn\xe2\x80\x99t get recognized quite that much.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re dealing with some pretty serious issues down here.</p>\n<p>I have to say that FEMA and the White House have both been absolutely supportive.\xc2\xa0 Very quickly FEMA was on the ground here before the raindrops started falling.\xc2\xa0 This is the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s second visit down here.\xc2\xa0 The President was on the phone to me before the sun came up practically on Monday morning. Slightly after it came up, other people from the White House had called and checked in with us and helped.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve had a couple long conversations with Secretary Napolitano about how she could help.</p>\n<p>I have been -- I was mayor of Nashville for eight years before being governor, now seven.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve never seen this kind of a response to things that have happened.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had our share of tornadoes and those kinds of things.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m -- certainly from my perspective as governor, we have a lot of issues to deal with; I\'m very, very pleased with the response that we\'ve gotten from the administration.</p>\n<p>I\'d also say, just take a word, when these kinds of things happen, so much of the stuff that\'s important on the front lines happen in local government.\xc2\xa0 It happens with the mayors and especially the first responders.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we have in Tennessee lots of professional first responders, lots of people who are volunteers who spent the weekend out there doing some extraordinary things.\xc2\xa0 I hope someday somebody kind of gathers up and recounts the -- there were people here in Tennessee who lost their lives literally trying to save other people.\xc2\xa0 And it just gives you great faith in your fellow Americans when you watch the kind of response to this kind of a disaster.</p>\n<p>There will be plenty of time for questions and other people have things to say.\xc2\xa0 I just want to say that we\'ve had an extraordinary event here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just Nashville; it really is across a number of places in the state.\xc2\xa0 A place like Nashville has lots of resources to deal with it.\xc2\xa0 Some of our rural counties are a much tougher case in that regard.\xc2\xa0 And those are places where FEMA becomes extraordinarily -- Red Cross becomes extraordinarily important in the response.</p>\n<p>But so far things are moving smoothly.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re digging out, but this will take a long time before Tennessee is back to normal.</p>\n<p>Mayor Dean?</p>\n<p>MAYOR DEAN:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve been very appreciative of the response we\'ve gotten from the state and from the federal government.\xc2\xa0 The Governor has been in constant contact with us and has helped us in any way that he could.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ve been very happy that FEMA has been present and on the ground almost immediately and helping us.</p>\n<p>The storm which occurred really Saturday and Sunday was unprecedented.\xc2\xa0 It was by any measure, on both days, record-setting amounts of rain.\xc2\xa0 There is no recorded record of rain in Nashville that is anywhere remotely close to the figures we got. And it simply overwhelmed the system that we have here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\'ve been very satisfied with the response of our Office of Emergency Management.\xc2\xa0 They were prepared.\xc2\xa0 We went into operations really full-bore on Saturday afternoon.\xc2\xa0 And the first responders -- police, fire, and ambulance -- were fantastic.\xc2\xa0 They answered thousands of calls; made many, many water rescues; and worked very hard all during the storm.</p>\n<p>On Monday and Tuesday we sort of sweated out how far the river would rise.\xc2\xa0 The river finally crested sometime between 6:00 and 8:00 on Monday night, and has been steadily falling since then.\xc2\xa0 We\'re hoping that we\'ll get down to flood level probably tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Our schools are still not in session yet.\xc2\xa0 We have roads closed.\xc2\xa0 We were hit in a variety of places around the city.\xc2\xa0 Nashville is a metropolitan form of government -- the area I\'m mayor of is 500 square miles -- and there are pockets north, south, east and west where things were really, really flooded and property damage is substantial, and people have been placed out of their homes.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had nine deaths here so far.</p>\n<p>Right now we\'re going door to door, trying to determine if there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody in some of the buildings that were totally submerged.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s taking some time, though we\'re getting it done.\xc2\xa0 We\'re beginning the recovery process.\xc2\xa0 We have five local assistance offices set up.\xc2\xa0 The Public Works Department is out working already and we\'re waiting just as the water totally recedes so we can get done what we need to do.</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We were watching the risk of severe weather across the southeast as we went into the weekend, but I don\'t think anybody was quite prepared to look at how much rain fell in such a short period of time over such a large area and across Tennessee and other states.\xc2\xa0 The weekend before, we dealt with tornadoes, but this weekend we did have some tornadoes but the predominant factor here was just the amount of rainfall and the damage it caused.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve been working very closely with our partners here at TEMA -- the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency -- our regional staff in Region IV were here as liaisons.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President, who had been briefed on this and understood the magnitude of this, particularly in the initial reports of loss of life, which unfortunately continued to go up, asked that we come here.</p>\n<p>I met with the Governor, where he formally requested the President to declare a disaster area, which the President did the next day.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work at adding counties to the declaration and working as the local communities still are in response phase, but as they begin moving toward recovery, to support that.\xc2\xa0 And again, as always, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt with FEMA before, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask your indulgence in helping us get the word out to the survivors in Tennessee that have been impacted by these floods and these tornadoes to register with FEMA at 800-621-FEMA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, a second way to get information, I know many people probably, with their home damaged, may only have their phones with them.\xc2\xa0 If they do have a mobile phone that can go to a website, we\xe2\x80\x99ve set up a mobile FEMA website -- it\xe2\x80\x99s m.fema.gov -- that will again get them the information numbers and start that process of them registering for assistance from the federal government.</p>\n<p>MR. BECKER:\xc2\xa0 This is Joe Becker, from the American Red Cross.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard described the tremendous geography that this storm spanned and the damage across such a widespread area.\xc2\xa0 What that also means is different communities are in different places in response and recovery, depends if the water is still up or down, or whether roads are passable or not.</p>\n<p>And what that means is people are in different stages.\xc2\xa0 Some still need immediate emergency help.\xc2\xa0 Others are starting to figure out how to move forward with their lives.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of a tremendous government response.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Across Tennessee, there\xe2\x80\x99s also a great network of nongovernmental organizations, nonprofits -- and particularly the faith community -- who stepped forward and done a terrific job of responding to needs.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s also been a very heartwarming sense of neighbors helping neighbors in a fairly unprecedented way here -- great hospitality in the people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I can tell you from the Red Cross perspective, we have volunteers here from 37 states who have fanned out across the state of Tennessee and are still meeting those immediate emergency needs in many places -- shelter, food, supplies that people need to clean up and just immediate comfort items.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear here.\xc2\xa0 This is going to be a long slog.\xc2\xa0 This is going to be for weeks and weeks with various communities in different stages.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a team effort of government, of nongovernment, and of people helping people.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing with -- this is a tough response.\xc2\xa0 The people have been through a lot.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just their physical needs.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also their emotional needs.\xc2\xa0 And as they lean on each other, our job is to make sure that the network of nonprofits steps forward, that the Red Cross takes a lead role in that response, and that we work closely with government to make sure that the people\xe2\x80\x99s needs are met.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hello.\xc2\xa0 Thanks much for having the call.\xc2\xa0 To Mr. Fugate, there was some concern in Washington about FEMA\xe2\x80\x99s disaster funding running dry.\xc2\xa0 I wondered how urgent is it to get funding restored through a supplemental appropriations bill.</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is an urgency there.\xc2\xa0 We have two pieces of this funding.\xc2\xa0 Within the disaster recovery fund, we do have money for immediate needs response, so that we are not going to be delayed in helping individuals in the emergency response costs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But as this flood is going to show, we already have almost a billion dollars in outstanding projects from previous disasters that are permanent work that we cannot go forward on, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that with this flood in Tennessee, as we get these numbers that\xe2\x80\x99s going to add to that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So while we can continue to meet the immediate needs of the survivors in these declared disasters, and we can support state and local government and the immediate response, we do not have the ability right now to fund permanent work.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a key factor in this recovery, as well as previous disasters all the way back to Katrina and even earlier, that we cannot go forward with permanent work until we get additional funds.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Governor, would you be able to estimate the damage around the state at this point?</p>\n<p>GOVERNOR BREDESEN:\xc2\xa0 I have some anecdotal information at the moment, but this is the sort of thing -- I\xe2\x80\x99d like to wait.\xc2\xa0 We have in FEMA an organization that is very well qualified, very well prepared to go do these damage assessments, and I think rather than just throwing numbers out there, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather wait and see what they have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The communities -- when we do these initially, it is generally because we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a presidential declaration and have to show a certain level of damage.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not going to be a difficulty.\xc2\xa0 If you just walk down one street in some of the counties, we\xe2\x80\x99ve already met the level of damage.</p>\n<p>So if you don\'t mind, I would like to wait until we have an assessment, and then will be glad to share with you the detailed information.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\'d be astonished if there weren\xe2\x80\x99t -- I would say I\'d be astonished if there weren\xe2\x80\x99t a billion dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of damage in the public or private sector, and probably considerably more.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously a lot of the focus has been on Nashville, and you did mention that outside areas have seen a lot of damage, as well.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk a little bit about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening out in the state, addressing issues like in Dyersburg County and other more far-flung areas?</p>\n<p>GOVERNOR BREDESEN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we have been -- I went up yesterday up into Montgomery County and Sumner County to look at the damage up there.\xc2\xa0 This is one where, as you know, the level of ability of counties to respond to these things is very, very -- in a place like -- we\xe2\x80\x99re sitting here in Nashville in an operation center, which would be suitable for any city in the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a great location with a lot of people.\xc2\xa0 In a smaller county, you just don\'t have the staff and the people on there.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re very dependent on TEMA.</p>\n<p>But TEMA is working and has a presence in every one of these counties, helping through the issues.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the issues of water, of water supply, and there still are a number a counties in which there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- more than a suggestion, really a requirement to boil drinking water.\xc2\xa0 There have been some water supply issues in other places.\xc2\xa0 A number of counties have now come off of that requirement or request to boil the water.</p>\n<p>But this is where TEMA earns its pay.\xc2\xa0 They have the ability to do that.\xc2\xa0 They have the breadth of staffing that it takes to respond to these things.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve had a presence out in all of these counties helping people.</p>\n<p>There is some frustration.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had some county mayors on the phone wanting to know why this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet and so on, but that\'s normal and reasonable.</p>\n<p>This is a place where we\xe2\x80\x99ve invested a lot of money and a lot of time in putting together an organization that can respond. And just as FEMA does in the federal government, this is the time at which you turn to them and say, okay, one person, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get around every county that\xe2\x80\x99s out there and see it; this is where you put this stuff into play.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it and we\xe2\x80\x99re helping these counties as best we can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Governor, in your conversation with the President, was there any discussion about him coming down at some point to visit the area?\xc2\xa0 He obviously went down fairly quickly the Gulf. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a full tour of the oil damage down there, but he was in the region.\xc2\xa0 Any conversation about him going to Tennessee?</p>\n<p>GOVERNOR BREDESEN:\xc2\xa0 I talked with him briefly about that and also with Valerie Jarrett at somewhat greater length -- I think it was the following day.\xc2\xa0 And what I basically said is that, first of all, he certainly would be welcome and we would accommodate him.\xc2\xa0 During the first two or three days in my previous experience, it sometimes is counterproductive in that when a President comes with all that\'s involved in that, it can slow things down -- it can slow things down a little bit.\xc2\xa0 But that as we -- the point we\xe2\x80\x99re at now, if he wanted to do so, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve communicated back that he would be very welcome.</p>\n<p>The President has a lot of things on his plate, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99re working through these things with the help of FEMA and the Red Cross and a lot of others.\xc2\xa0 But he certainly is welcome to come here any time that he wants.\xc2\xa0 And I talked to Secretary Napolitano this morning, made the same offer to her.</p>\n<p>But I want to just say, both of them -- I know as a governor something like this happens and every place you don\xe2\x80\x99t go to suddenly feels that somehow they\xe2\x80\x99ve been slighted.\xc2\xa0 And I want to make absolutely sure that no one feels that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is one of those things that we would love to see him if he wants to come, or if the Secretary wants to come, they\xe2\x80\x99d be delighted here.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re getting the help that we need and if what he needs to do is to be in Washington or dealing with the Gulf or something, or any one of a myriad other problems, that is completely understood and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone takes any offense whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 I understand the Opryland Hotel complex was flooded and 1,500 people were evacuated.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s happened to them and what is the overall cost to Nashville\xe2\x80\x99s tourist industry?</p>\n<p>MAYOR DEAN:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the overall cost to the tourist industry, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet.\xc2\xa0 Opryland was flooded and it will be closed for several months as they fix it up.\xc2\xa0 The folks who were evacuated from there were brought actually for the most part to a high school here in Nashville, McGavock High School.\xc2\xa0 And I think that operation went very well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I would note that the Grand Old Opry itself, which is in the building next to Gaylord Hotel, that that was flooded, but the Opry went on -- the Opry took place at the War Memorial Auditorium, which is downtown next to the state capitol, and was a successful event.\xc2\xa0 And I applaud Gaylord for being innovative and keeping the show on during this trying time.</p>\n<p>I think clearly Nashville is very much associated with music -- all types of music, and the Grand Old Opry, in particular, and the fact that we were able to keep it going really hours or a couple days after this event speaks well of Gaylord, and it speaks well of the city of Nashville and it speaks well of country music.</p>\n<p>MR. CARROLL:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Operator, I believe we have time for two more questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, thank you for having this.\xc2\xa0 I was interested in knowing if you could tell us what sorts of things FEMA will be able to do for Tennesseans.</p>\n<p>MR. FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Yes, this is Craig Fugate.\xc2\xa0 In the President\xe2\x80\x99s disaster declaration and the counties that are declared, he declared for individual assistance.\xc2\xa0 And that turns on a variety of programs, including Small Business Administration disaster loans for businesses, and for those people that have the ability to repay loans, to provide them assistance in rebuilding and repairs that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have insurance for.\xc2\xa0 It provides a variety of FEMA programs that can provide rental assistance or other direct grant assistance to individuals.</p>\n<p>And it provides additional items that the state may request to include crisis counseling, as well as working with our federal partners with some of the programs that will be available to the state if it\xe2\x80\x99s needed, including things like disaster unemployment insurance for people that have been impacted by this disaster.</p>\n<p>But the other part of this is that FEMA is not the team, we\xe2\x80\x99re just part of the team, and a lot of this will be done in conjunction with our volunteer partners -- with Red Cross and others -- in making sure that as we address needs that our federal programs can fit and provide that support, we utilize those, and where we have other unmet needs that we work together with our volunteer and local agencies and address those needs.</p>\n<p>But our individual assistance programs are again -- the trigger for this is people do have to register.\xc2\xa0 They can either do that by calling 1-800-621-FEMA or registering by going to our mobile site m.fema.gov, or just <a href="http://www.fema.gov">www.fema.gov</a>, and you can apply online if you are able to do that, as well.</p>\n<p>MR. CARROLL:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Operator, we have time for one more question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Fugate, could you say how many applications for assistance FEMA has received at this point?\xc2\xa0 And what percentage are coming from people who don\xe2\x80\x99t have flood insurance?</p>\n<p>MR. FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Right now, what\xe2\x80\x99s coming to our tele-registration, which is that 1-800 number, is about 8,500.\xc2\xa0 Until we do the inspections and actually get out there, we won\xe2\x80\x99t have a breakdown on insurance.\xc2\xa0 But as we get that information, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be working back to state and local governments -- because that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a huge issue with the people that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have flood insurance, and looking at what, from either SBA disaster loans or FEMA grants, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to provide.</p>\n<p>And the other thing I wanted to mention is, as the Governor points out, this has not just been Nashville that\xe2\x80\x99s been hit.\xc2\xa0 It has been other areas of Tennessee.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll be here part of the day, and then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to head over to the western part of the state.\xc2\xa0 And again our goal here is to really try the story of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in Tennessee -- that although the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s team and local officials have been doing a great job of response, we want to make sure that FEMA, on behalf of the President, that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can and that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone in these areas and made sure that we have a good understanding of what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be needed to support the state of Tennessee, and many of these local communities recover from what, as the Governor says, this is a very large, very complex flood event, and the numbers, as we continue to look, are only going to go up.</p>\n<p>MAYOR DEAN:\xc2\xa0 Could I add one thing that I should have said earlier?\xc2\xa0 On the question about tourism, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people around the country to understand the magnitude of this event and how we have needs in national in terms -- particularly in terms of housing and people whose property was damaged severely during this flood.\xc2\xa0 But one thing I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand is that we\xe2\x80\x99re still open for business.\xc2\xa0 I mean, Nashville is -- there are huge portions of the city -- 80, 90 percent of the city -- that\'s really unhurt by the flood.\xc2\xa0 The airport is open; the interstates are running.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have also a strong downtown where we anticipate things like the Country Music Hall of Fame to open this weekend.\xc2\xa0 The honkytonks, which are really the most important thing, are already open and there\xe2\x80\x99s music there and beer there and barbeque. We have -- our art museum is open.\xc2\xa0 We will have the country music festival in June -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve already said that is clearly going to go on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get across to folks is -- and this is really important to get -- is that we\xe2\x80\x99re open for business right now.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99ve got reservations to come to Nashville, we want to see you here, we expect to see you here.\xc2\xa0 And you need to make reservations to come to Nashville.\xc2\xa0 This is really one of the great destinations in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And the downtown I guarantee you will be thriving this weekend and it\xe2\x80\x99s only going to get stronger day after day as you go out -- because we\xe2\x80\x99re going to restore that very, very quickly.</p>\n<p>GOVERNOR BREDESEN:\xc2\xa0 This is Phil Bredesen, just to wrap this up.\xc2\xa0 First of all, if the mayor ceases to want to be mayor and would like to become the commissioner of tourism -- (laughter) -- I would be delighted to work it out.\xc2\xa0 But what the mayor says is absolutely right.\xc2\xa0 I was the mayor when the tornado came through here in the late \xe2\x80\x9890s, and part of the problem was half of the country thought that Nashville was wiped off the face of the Earth, and nothing could be further from the truth.</p>\n<p>One of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very tough about this is that a lot of the homes that were affected were not in those A and B designations of the flood plain areas where flood insurance would have been required by mortgages.\xc2\xa0 They were homes that no one would have thought would be in a flood plain.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The engineers draw all these nice careful lines where the flood plains are, but when you get this kind of event and flowing water, water goes where it wants to, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an awful lot of homes and no one dreamt of would ever be in danger of that. Therefore, people didn\xe2\x80\x99t have flood insurance and therefore they\xe2\x80\x99re in a lot of difficulty.\xc2\xa0 For these homeowners, it just adds to the pain that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already experienced in this country with home values in the recent past here.</p>\n<p>But I just want to conclude by saying we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a significant event here, a huge -- less than once-in-a-lifetime kind of event certainly in terms of the weather.\xc2\xa0 It is all over the western and middle parts of the state, not just in Nashville. First responders and local governments, our TEMA operation is doing a great job.\xc2\xa0 FEMA and the White House could not have been more helpful in this thing.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not a veteran of a number of these disasters and I really -- I very, very much appreciate the support that we have had.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re working through this and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get through it just fine.\xc2\xa0 And we appreciate all the help that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been receiving from everyone up to this point.</p>\n<p>Thank you all very much for being on the call.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n4:25 P.M.
