Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:16 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 I see only a couple of familiar faces from last week.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to be back in Washington and to be here with all of you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements at the top, but in the spirit of the Vineyard, Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you go first off the tee here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 To start with -- Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Hosni Mubarak may be released from jail later this week while the last democratically elected leader, Mohamed Morsi, remains detained.\xc2\xa0 Considering that Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s ouster was one of the major things that brought secularists and Islamists together in Egypt, how alarming is that to the President?\xc2\xa0 And has he spoken, or has the White House spoken with Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s military leaders about Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s possible release?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations to read out to you in terms of conversations between senior Obama administration officials and leaders of the interim government in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 But I do want to draw a line between a couple of things that you referred to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The legal proceedings against former President Mubarak are something that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing inside of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 That is an Egyptian legal matter and something that I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave for them to determine, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to weigh on from here.\xc2\xa0 But something that we have weighed in on, something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said previously but other senior administration officials have also said -- that politically motivated detentions inside Egypt should end, and that certainly would include the politically motivated detention of former President Morsi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the U.N. and others here have been for weeks calling for that type of non-politicized end to violence, reconciliation and such ever since the military ousted Morsi with pretty poor results and a death toll that\xe2\x80\x99s reaching about a thousand.\xc2\xa0 So is the U.S. changing either its tactics or its strategy in response to the approach not working up until now?\xc2\xa0 Or are we continuing with the same approach and hoping that somehow things will work better?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a couple of different things that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 The first is -- and this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made reference to on several occasions -- there are ongoing conversations between senior administration officials here in this country and senior administration officials in Egypt, that there is a dialogue that\xe2\x80\x99s open.\xc2\xa0 And in the context of those conversations, this administration and senior leaders in this administration have made clear that it is incumbent upon the interim government in Egypt to follow through on their promise to transition back to a democratically elected, civilian government in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also important for that interim government in Egypt to respect basic human rights.\xc2\xa0 That includes everything from the right to peaceful protest, and it means the end of politically motivated detentions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we have made our position on these issues, on these very important issues crystal clear.\xc2\xa0 In the context of this, we have also -- the President has also directed all of the relevant agencies and departments in this administration to review the assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s provided to the Egyptian government.\xc2\xa0 That review is ongoing and that review is being made in light of actions that are taken by the interim Egyptian government.</p>\n<p>So there certainly are consequences for the actions that are taken by the interim government.\xc2\xa0 There are a couple of good recent examples that I can point to on that.\xc2\xa0 The first is the delayed delivery of the F-16s that were in the pipeline and scheduled for delivery to Egypt; that delivery was delayed.\xc2\xa0 And also, last week, the President delivered a statement from Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard, where he announced the cancellation of the joint military exercise known as Bright Star.</p>\n<p>So there have been some consequences for the actions that have been taken by the interim government.\xc2\xa0 And we are hopeful that -- well, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99d also say this:\xc2\xa0 There have also been consequences for other nations, that there are other nations that have raised concerns in the region and in Europe and other places about the actions taken by the interim Egyptian government.\xc2\xa0 So this is not something that is only in the interest of the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\'s in the interest of our partners in the region and our allies around the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting today on Dodd-Frank, it comes about a little over three years since he signed that law.\xc2\xa0 One count says that about 60 percent of the rule-making deadlines have been missed.\xc2\xa0 And even the former FDIC chair says it\'s been disappointing and she\'d give it about a C-plus.\xc2\xa0 So what is the President\'s view of the progress on the law and the reason for those delays?\xc2\xa0 Does the banking industry have too much influence over the regulators?\xc2\xa0 And what\'s going to be his message to regulators today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, part of his message to these independent regulators who have a job description that\'s codified under the law -- but the President will have a message to these regulators, which is he is going to convey to them the sense of urgency that he feels about getting these regulations under Wall Street reform implemented promptly and, most importantly, implemented in a way that protects the long-term stability of our financial system and the financial interests of middle-class families all across the country.</p>\n<p>A recent good example of this was the confirmation of Richard Cordray as the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\xc2\xa0 For the first time, consumers in America will have a watchdog in Washington, D.C. that will be looking out for their interests.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no question that large financial institutions, including investment firms and banks on Wall Street, wield significant influence over the political process in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the benefit of having independent regulators who can make their own determinations about the rules and regulations that should be put in place to protect the financial system, but also to protect the interests of middle-class families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President is pleased with the progress that they have made.\xc2\xa0 There are some important rules that have been put in place.\xc2\xa0 More work needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 And as we approach the fifth anniversary of the financial meltdown, today seems as an appropriate day as any to start having that conversation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 British authorities detained David Miranda, who, as you know, is the partner of Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who wrote about the secrets that Edward Snowden revealed.\xc2\xa0 Human rights groups have called this detention -- which was for nine hours -- harassment.\xc2\xa0 The Brazilian government has said there was no justification for it.\xc2\xa0 Was the United States government at all involved in this?\xc2\xa0 And what is the justification for it, if so?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, what you\'re referring to is a law enforcement action that was taken by the British government.\xc2\xa0 The United States was not involved in that decision or in that action.\xc2\xa0 So if you have questions about it, then I would refer you to the British government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. feel that Miranda could have revealed information that\'s useful in terms of finding Edward Snowden or pursuing its case against Snowden in any way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Like I said, I\'m not aware of any of the conversations that Mr. Miranda may have had with British law enforcement officials while he was detained.\xc2\xa0 But that detention was a decision that was made by the British government and is something that if you have questions about you should ask them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to Josh\'s question about Dodd-Frank, numerous important rules have been delayed -- the Volcker Rule, the naming of some systemic important institutions, risk retention.\xc2\xa0 Are there any particular rules that the President is going to push regulators to get done quickly?\xc2\xa0 And if so, which ones?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything that detailed to read out to you in terms of the conversations that the President plans to have with these independent regulators.\xc2\xa0 There are some important decisions that remain to be made by these regulators as they implement Wall Street reform.\xc2\xa0 And the President is going to urge them to put those rules in place in a way that protects the interests of middle class families.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President believes.\xc2\xa0 As you know, and as you\'ve heard us talk about quite a bit and as you\'ve heard the President talk about quite a bit, the economic interests of middle-class families is his top domestic priority.\xc2\xa0 And there certainly is an important stake for middle-class families in the implementation of some of these financial regulations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, again, these are independent regulators, so they\'re going to make their own decisions about what those rules should be and how this regulatory regime is put in place.\xc2\xa0 We\'re certainly pleased with the level of cooperation and coordination that\'s taken place among these independent regulators.\xc2\xa0 And the President wants to encourage them to capitalize on the momentum they\'ve already built up to put this regulatory regime in place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the financial institutions that are being regulated under these new rules are saying that the sheer volume of these rules has placed a burden not only on them but on regulators, making it really difficult to implement them.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to try to simplify these rules, streamline them in any way to make them easier to put in place and actually enforce?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the regulatory regime is the responsibility of these regulators to put in place.\xc2\xa0 So they have a significant mandate -- there\'s no doubt about that -- that what we saw was a lack of regulation contributed to the worst economic recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re coming up on the fifth anniversary of that financial crisis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the reason that Wall Street reform was put in place was to make sure that Wall Street banks weren\'t exercising too much influence over that process and that middle-class families could be confident that there was an independent watchdog that would be looking out for their interests.\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly something that Richard Cordray has an important role in.\xc2\xa0 And there is a responsibility of all of these different regulatory agencies to work in coordinated fashion to put in place a regime that will protect our financial system and protect the interests of middle-class families.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that they have a tall order, but we\'re pleased with the progress that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made, and we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for them to exercise that responsibility outside of the influence of some Wall Street firms and other large financial institutions that are seeking to water this down.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, is there any area of the financial system where the President feels there\xe2\x80\x99s a risk of risky practices that are going unregulated, that should be reined in?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an analysis like that to share with you at this point.\xc2\xa0 But he certainly believes that the mandate of these independent regulators is really important and it\xe2\x80\x99s important to the broader stability of our financial system.\xc2\xa0 And they have an important job to do, and the President is going to encourage them to keep doing it.</p>\n<p>I\'m going to stick to the front row, but I\'m going to start jumping around here, so if you\'re in the back and you have a question, don\'t be shy.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your repetition of what the President said about the review of assistance to Egypt being ongoing seems to suggest that there\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility that it could be reduced or eliminated.\xc2\xa0 But what difference would it make, given the fact that Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States are supporting Egypt at a much greater rate than we are, given the fact that most of what we give them gets spent on U.S. military products, and given the concern that any less in aid could result in less protection for American facilities and pave the way for another Benghazi?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess there\xe2\x80\x99s a question in there somewhere.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are three of them.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll try to divine it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me start here by saying there are two criteria that the President and other senior administration officials are using to evaluate the ongoing provision of assistance to the Egyptian government.\xc2\xa0 The first is evaluating what\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the national security of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 That\'s how the President makes all national security and foreign policy decisions and that\'s how this one will be made, too.</p>\n<p>The second one is considering our obligations under the law, and in this case, that is Section 7008 of the Annual Department of State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Act.\xc2\xa0 And this administration, of course, will make these decisions to ensure that whatever assistance is being provided is being provided in the context and within the confines of Section 7008.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the bigger picture here?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there no concern that a diminution of U.S. aid would prompt the Egyptian generals to lower their level of protection on U.S. facilities?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would characterize the relationship between the United States and Egypt as a really important one beyond just the financial cooperation -- I should say the military cooperation that we have with the Egyptian military.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is a relationship that extends to economic support and economic assistance that\'s provided by the United States government to the Egyptian government.\xc2\xa0 Certainly there are issues related to International Monetary Fund assistance that the Egyptian government is seeking.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, the United States would have some influence on that process as well.\xc2\xa0 There are also issues related to tourism, that there are -- that has a significant impact on the Egyptian economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is a multifaceted relationship that we have with Egypt.\xc2\xa0 We certainly value that relationship.\xc2\xa0 I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the Egyptian government does as well.\xc2\xa0 But the question that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking is:\xc2\xa0 What impact would changing our posture toward providing assistance to the Egyptians have on the situation?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I can tell you that that is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re evaluating on an ongoing basis.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the purpose of these reviews, is to determine what impact it would have on our national security, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in compliance with the law, and is it going to get us closer to seeing the kind of outcome in Egypt that we would like to see, which is the prompt return to a democratically elected, civilian government in Egypt.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when are you going to figure it out?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that is being conducted on an ongoing basis, and it certainly is influenced by the day-to-day decisions that are being made by the current leaders in Egypt, okay?</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the back.\xc2\xa0 Olivier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the Mubarak detention as being a Egyptian legal matter.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about Morsi\xe2\x80\x99s politically motivated detention.\xc2\xa0 And then with regard to Mr. Greenwald\xe2\x80\x99s partner, you called it a \xe2\x80\x9cmere law enforcement action.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Given that the White House has never been shy about criticizing detention policies overseas, do you have any concerns at all about the U.K.\xe2\x80\x99s law enforcement actions in this case?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can say is I don\'t have a specific reaction other than to observe to you that this is a decision that was made by the British government and not one that was made at the request or with the involvement of the United States government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not going to go as far as to say it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong or it\xe2\x80\x99s cause for concern?\xc2\xa0 You\'re just separating yourself entirely from it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m separating -- what I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that this is a decision that was made by the British government without the involvement and not at the request of the United States government.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s simple as that.</p>\n<p>Stephen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow then, does the U.S. government expect to be briefed on those -- the questioning that took place in London, or the information that was taken away from Mr. Greenwald\xe2\x80\x99s partner?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 To be honest with you, Steve, I don\'t have a way to characterize for you any of the conversations between the British government and the U.S. government on this matter other than to say that this is a decision that they made on their own and not at the request of the United States.</p>\n<p>But in terms of the kinds of classified, confidential conversations that are ongoing between the U.S. and our allies in Britain, I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to characterize that for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there are consultations on this matter taking place?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to provide any insight into those conversations at all.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A thought on Egypt.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, the Egyptian -- the interim government in Egypt says that what they\'re doing is controlling terrorism -- that\xe2\x80\x99s their line.\xc2\xa0 In fact, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been very forceful about that line.\xc2\xa0 The United States has said that -- it has come out against attacks on peaceful protests.\xc2\xa0 Does the United States believe that the people who have been killed in Egypt, for the most part, are terrorists?\xc2\xa0 And that those people who are protesting peacefully in the squares of Egypt have been terrorists?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What you\xe2\x80\x99re asking is a pretty broad question, because we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a large number of people in a large country under a lot of different circumstances.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99ve concluded is that there are a -- that it is evident that a large number of people who were peaceful protestors were the victims of violence that was perpetrated by the interim government in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 That is something that we have strongly condemned.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President himself has personally condemned, which he did in his statement on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 And it is not in line with the commitment that was made by the interim government in Egypt to transition back to a democratically elected, civilian government.\xc2\xa0 It does not reflect their commitment to begin an inclusive process to transition back to that democratically elected, civilian government.</p>\n<p>So there are a number of actions that have been taken by the interim government that have aroused the concern of people in the United States and people all around the world because of their refusal -- or at this case, failure, at least, to respect the basic human rights of their people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But among those who have been killed and attacked, when you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated issue, do you believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated issue.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to characterize thousands of people who have been the victim of violence, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just not in a position to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to comment on what the Egyptian government is saying now, that what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is carrying out violent acts against terrorists.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we have commented on and what we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about are those instances in which the basic human rights of some Egyptian people have been so obviously and grievously violated -- in some cases, costing these civilians their lives.\xc2\xa0 That does not live up to the promise that was made by the interim government to transition back to a democratically elected, civilian government through an inclusive process.\xc2\xa0 The imposition of a state of emergency is certainly not in line with a commitment to upholding and protecting those basic human rights, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that has drawn the strong condemnation of the President of the United States, the Secretary of State of the United States, and leaders all around the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, finally, besides the military aid, there\xe2\x80\x99s also economic aid.\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us about what kind of economic aid the United States is now withholding from Egypt?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s been -- no decision has been made to withhold any aid outside of the F-16 example that I cited for you earlier, as well the joint military exercise example that the President announced on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 No decisions about economic aid have been made, but they\xe2\x80\x99re subject to evaluation through the same criteria, which is Section 7008 and a determination about the national security interest of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 So that aid is being similarly evaluated through similar criteria, but no decisions about that have been made at this point.</p>\n<p>Jessica.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Can you state with authority that the U.S. government has not obtained material from the laptop the British authorities confiscated from Glenn Greenwald\xe2\x80\x99s partner or from any of his personal devices they also confiscated?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not in a position to talk to you about the conversations between British law enforcement officials and American law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you can\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that the U.S. has obtained this material?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to do that right now, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You also didn\xe2\x80\x99t condemn -- the White House didn\xe2\x80\x99t condemn the detention.\xc2\xa0 Is the President pleased that he was condemned -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, is the President pleased that he was detained?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is a law enforcement action that was taken by the British government, and this is something that that they did independent of our direction, as you would expect -- that the British government is going to make law enforcement decisions that they determine are in the best interest of their country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the White House consulted or given a heads-up in advance?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There was a heads-up that was provided by the British government.\xc2\xa0 So, again, this is something that we had an indication was likely to occur, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that we requested, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that was done specifically by the British law enforcement officials there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it at all concerning to the President, this sort of a nine-hour detention?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is an independent British law enforcement decision that was made.\xc2\xa0 I know the suggestion has been raised by some that this is an effort to intimidate journalists.\xc2\xa0 And with all of you, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been undergoing a pretty rigorous debate on a range of issues related to an independent media -- an independent journalist covering the application of national security rules, questions about national security leaks and other classified or confidential information and policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President, I think, in the course of the debate, has made pretty clear his support for independent journalists, the important role that independent journalists have to play in a vibrant, democratic society like ours.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also talked about the responsibility of the government to protect the right of independent journalists to do their job.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President feels strongly about and has spoken candidly about in the past.\xc2\xa0 But, again, if you have specific questions about this law enforcement decision that was made by the British government, you should direct your questions to my friends over there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One on Egypt, quickly.\xc2\xa0 How angry is the President with the Saudis for their quick assurance that Arab and Muslim countries will make up any aid the U.S. might pull from Egypt?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t actually seen that announcement from the Saudis.\xc2\xa0 All I can say is -- I would refer you back to the question, or the exchange that Bill and I had, which is that there is an important longstanding relationship between the United States and the Egyptians, and not just the two governments but also the people of those two countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is a relationship that we take very seriously, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re carefully -- part of that relationship involves aid to that country.\xc2\xa0 And that aid that we have provided in the past -- or the aid that\'s in the pipeline for us to provide moving forward is something that is under review and will be evaluated in the context of additional decisions that are made by the Egyptian government.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why was the United States given a heads-up by the British government on this detention?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, that heads-up was provided by the British government, so you can direct that question to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But was this heads-up given before he was detained or before it went public that he was detained?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a heads-up if they would have told us about it after they detained him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say they told you they were going to do this when they saw that he was on a manifest?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that is an accurate interpretation of what a heads-up is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this gentleman on some sort of watch list for the United States?\xc2\xa0 Can you look that up?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to check with the TSA because they maintain the watch list.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t know if they\xe2\x80\x99d tell you or not, but you can ask them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If he\xe2\x80\x99s on a watch list for the U.K., would it be safe to assume then that he\xe2\x80\x99s been put on a watch list in the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The level of coordination between counterterrorism and law enforcement officials in the U.K. and counterterrorism and law enforcement officials in the United States is very good.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of who is on different watch lists and how our actions and their actions are coordinated is not something I\xe2\x80\x99m in a position to talk about from here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the United States government -- when given the heads-up, did the United States government express any hesitancy about the U.K. doing it -- about the U.K. government doing this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is the British government making a decision based on British law, on British soil, about a British law enforcement action.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the United States, when given the heads-up, just said okay?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They gave us a heads-up, and this is something that they did not do at our direction and it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that we were involved with.\xc2\xa0 This is a decision that they made on their own.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the United States discourage the action?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize the conversations between law enforcement officials in this country and law enforcement officials there other than to say that those conversations occurred and to point out the fact that this is a decision that they made on their own.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if the -- is it fair to say if the United States had discouraged it, you\xe2\x80\x99d tell us?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, because I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair for you to determine that those kinds of law enforcement conversations are not ones that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk about in public.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Egypt, since everything is -- is it fair to characterize that the President is still considering officially calling this a coup as part of the aid review process?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We have said --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You ruled that out completely?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve said for some time now that we have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll never refer to it as a coup?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve concluded that it is not in the best interest of the United States to reach a determination on a coup.\xc2\xa0 That is a decision that will be set aside and that we will evaluate our assistance to the Egyptians based on the two criteria that I laid out before:\xc2\xa0 the law, as described in Section 7008, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s assessment about the national security interests of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you -- that the administration needs Congress to legislate in order to get the President more tools to determine what to do with Egyptian aid?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 that\'s a question that I would encourage you to direct to some of our national security professionals who may be able to explain that to you here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have anything --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything in front of me to indicate that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there a certain amount of time that President Morsi is in custody that changes the equation?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you talked about strongly condemning.\xc2\xa0 Why not connect an action, saying to the Egyptians, you have 10 days to release him or this happens?\xc2\xa0 Why not the decision to do something like that?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been -- it\xe2\x80\x99s now a month and a half.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken out in pretty clear terms about these politically motivated detentions and our concerns about them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In strongly worded letters and press releases.\xc2\xa0 But is there --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And in conversations and the declaration --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the declaration that will come with --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And the declaration that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to review our assistance to the Egypt -- to the Egyptian government in light of their conduct.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that\'s ongoing, and I don\'t have any -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no new announcements about that to make other than the decision by the President that was announced on Thursday to cancel the joint military operation and the decision of a few weeks prior to that about the deliver of F-16s.\xc2\xa0 So there have been some consequences and some decisions that have been made, but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new to report out at this time.</p>\n<p>But it\xe2\x80\x99s fair for you to understand and for your viewers to understand that these conversations between senior Obama administration officials and senior officials in Egypt are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And they recognize the unambiguous position that the President and this administration -- and his administration has taken to condemn violence that\'s been perpetrated against civilians, the failure of the interim government to respect basic human rights, and the failure of the interim government to live up to their promise to transition back to a democratically elected, civilian government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the United States offered security to President Morsi if some of sort of -- if the Egyptians will release him to the United States or help give him security if there\xe2\x80\x99s fear that his life is in danger, or something like that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of anything like that.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to the back.\xc2\xa0 Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I don\'t want to standardize a term of \xe2\x80\x9cheads-up,\xe2\x80\x9d but to what degree was a heads-up given to the Egyptian government, the interim Egyptian government prior to the administration\xe2\x80\x99s decision last week to cancel the Bright Star games next month?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I have conveyed to you a couple of times from this podium and the podium up in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard last week that there are -- there\xe2\x80\x99s an open line of communication between senior administration officials here in the United States and their counterparts in the Egyptian government.</p>\n<p>And certainly, if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make a decision like canceling a joint military exercise, then it would make sense that the formal notification of that cancellation would be provided to the other half of the joint, if you will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To what degree was the interim Egyptian government prepared and enthusiastic to participate in the Bright Star games before the President made the decision to cancel them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Questions about the degree of enthusiasm of the interim Egyptian government should be directed to the interim Egyptian government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about preparedness?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them about their military preparedness.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a second question then -- with aid to now Egypt under question, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had so many questions over the last few months about aid to Syria, is there a guiding principle -- is there any guiding principle or underlying philosophies that you can reveal to us about aid to countries in that region or countries with certain backgrounds that the administration is taking that is guiding the administration in any way that we can understand?\xc2\xa0 Because it doesn\'t seem like -- it seems like these are being done on an ad hoc basis.\xc2\xa0 And if that\'s true, then maybe that can be clarified?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I actually think that I\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out -- or at least I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to lay out two very clear criteria that we are using to evaluate continued assistance to Egypt.\xc2\xa0 The first is a determination about the national security interests of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 That is the foremost criteria that the President uses in making any national security decision.\xc2\xa0 What impact is it going to have on our national security -- that\'s the first thing.</p>\n<p>The second thing is there are some aspects of American law that apply to these determinations about providing aid and assistance.\xc2\xa0 In this case, it\xe2\x80\x99s Section 7008 of the Annual Department of State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Act.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re obviously going to make decisions about providing aid and assistance to ensure that it complies with relevant law.\xc2\xa0 And those are the two principal criteria that we\'ll use to make decisions about aid and assistance.</p>\n<p>Now, that will also be affected by, of course, the future actions of the Egyptian government.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been pretty clear about that.\xc2\xa0 And there are a couple actions that we have taken as a result of our strong disappointment in actions that were taken by the interim Egyptian government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can I follow?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Hold on just a minute, we\'ll get around to you.</p>\n<p>Carol.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about the aid debate that\'s going on over Egypt.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you see a number of members of Congress are weighing in and you guys have consistently said that this aid is under review.\xc2\xa0 Bits and pieces are dripping out in terms of steps you\'re taking.\xc2\xa0 Is there a point in which the President feels that it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for him to come out and explain the process here to the American people in terms of why this is not an easy decision, why he has not made a decision on certain things, what his thinking is on this?\xc2\xa0 Because essentially what\xe2\x80\x99s happening is that people are watching this debate unfold and he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said all that much about where his thinking is and why he\xe2\x80\x99s doing this.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, he did have a news conference 10 days ago where he talked about this a little bit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Things have moved pretty far along since then.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They have.\xc2\xa0 They have.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s one other aspect of this that probably makes it difficult to cover this, which is that this is unfolding on a daily basis here.\xc2\xa0 And because of this ongoing review, these decisions about aid and assistance are the kinds of things that are being evaluated on a daily basis, and so that evaluation may or may not change.\xc2\xa0 No specific decisions have been made as a result of that at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But this is something that we\'re carefully looking at.\xc2\xa0 And we have tried to be clear about what are the factors that influence this decision, and this determination about our national security, about the best interests of our national security, and the specific section of the law that applies to foreign assistance.</p>\n<p>So we\'ve tried to explain to you and to your readers what kind of -- the criteria that we\'re using to make these decisions.\xc2\xa0 And you\'re right, the conditions on the ground are changing on a pretty regular basis and that has an influence on the calculation about our national security interests at play here and how the law applies.</p>\n<p>So I\'m not going to try to deny the notion that this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s evolving, and I think even that is evident from the fact that we have taken a couple of steps in terms of suspending the delivery of the F-16s and canceling the joint military exercise.\xc2\xa0 But this is something that is being evaluated on an ongoing basis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just quickly on the British detainment.\xc2\xa0 When was the U.S. given a heads-up?\xc2\xa0 How much -- how far in advance?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I actually don\'t have that information.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure how much of a heads-up they got.\xc2\xa0 But in advance of his detention, American officials were informed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know what American officials were informed?\xc2\xa0 Or which department -- was it the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, since the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement, more violence has continued and more deaths.\xc2\xa0 What options are on the table?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got Bright Star.\xc2\xa0 It seems like Bright Star hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really made a dent; you cancelled that.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s next?\xc2\xa0 What other options are on the table?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are a couple of things at play here.\xc2\xa0 There is some additional assistance in the pipeline, and that is -- the decision to move forward with providing that assistance is something that\xe2\x80\x99s being evaluated on an ongoing basis.\xc2\xa0 There are ongoing conversations between senior administration officials in this country and their counterparts in Egypt.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In the context of those conversations, unambiguous perspectives from the United States are being shared with the Egyptian government, urging them to follow through on their commitment to transition back to a democratically elected, civilian government.\xc2\xa0 On a regular basis, we\'re urging them to respect the basic human rights of their people.\xc2\xa0 On an ongoing basis, we\'re urging them to initiate an inclusive political process so that we can have a democratic government in Egypt that reflects the will of the Egyptian people.\xc2\xa0 So there are a number of conversations like that that are ongoing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There also is a role to be played by our allies and other partners in the region that also have an important relationship with the government of Egypt and the people of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 So this is a multidimensional policy challenge and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\'re evaluating on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0 And the President has spoken out on a couple of different occasions about how he views that situation and will continue to do that in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I asked that question because last week the President laid out that there are consequences, and Bright Star was the one consequence.\xc2\xa0 And he used words like \xe2\x80\x9ccondemn\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdeplore\xe2\x80\x9d and other strong words.\xc2\xa0 So, therefore, I mean -- you just have Bright Star lingering right now and that\'s in September.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s next?\xc2\xa0 What other options, tangible options or consequences that would hurt, that would make them take notice?\xc2\xa0 Because Bright Star apparently hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done much.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to draw that conclusion right now.\xc2\xa0 But what I would say is that there is a\xc2\xa0 -- I mean, there is a publicly disclosed menu of assistance that\'s in the pipeline to be provided to Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And I can ask somebody to follow up with you on that if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to take a look at that, and you can evaluate for yourself the significance of those programs.</p>\n<p>But, again, I\'m not suggesting that a decision has been made on those programs, just that those are in the pipeline and on an ongoing basis that assistance is being reviewed.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Josh, I want to go back to something that Olivier I think alluded to on Egypt before where you were saying when it comes to Morsi, at least a couple of times you\xe2\x80\x99ve said this is politically motivated detention and he needs to be released, but when it comes to Mubarak you\'re saying that\'s an internal legal matter that you\'re not going to get involved in.\xc2\xa0 Why are you not speaking out about the possibility of Mubarak being released when people are saying if he is released the Muslim Brotherhood may be inflamed even more and may target and kill more people?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason for that, simply, Ed, is just that President Mubarak is part of an ongoing Egyptian legal process right now.\xc2\xa0 He was charged with crimes.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s in the midst of that legal process.\xc2\xa0 And because that is a process that is internal to Egypt, it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that I\'m in a position to comment on from here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the interim government could say, look, what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with Morsi, it\xe2\x80\x99s internal legal business for them and stay out of it.\xc2\xa0 So what leverage do we have to tell them to release Morsi when we\'re not saying anything about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with Mubarak?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason that -- no one is suggesting, at least that I\'m aware of, no one is suggesting that the detention of Mubarak is politically motivated.\xc2\xa0 I think that there are crimes that he was charged with in the Egyptian criminal process.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m not going to comment on that.\xc2\xa0 You often hear me stand up here and say that I\'m not going to comment on an ongoing legal matter here in this country, and so I certainly wouldn\'t do that on Egypt.</p>\n<p>However, in the case of Mr. Morsi, what we see there is a pretty clearly politically motivated detention that is not in line with the human rights standards that we expect other governments to uphold.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Adam Gadahn, the American-born al Qaeda militant, has spoken out again and it\'s getting some notice around the world.\xc2\xa0 He praised the Benghazi attack.\xc2\xa0 He urged more violence against Americans, unfortunately.\xc2\xa0 What reaction do you have when Republican Senator Graham today put out some statement saying that he should be targeted by the U.S. military as an enemy combatant, even though he is a U.S. citizen?\xc2\xa0 What reaction do you have to that?\xc2\xa0 What reaction do you have to the statements that he is making?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I did not see Senator Graham\'s statement, so it\'s hard for me to comment on that.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the statements made by this one individual, it\'s a reminder that the global threat alert that this administration put out at the beginning of August remains in effect.\xc2\xa0 And our national security professionals are vigilant as ever in trying to protect the national security of the United States of America, our interests and our allies and our citizens all around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that they remain hard at work on.</p>\n<p>We have made tremendous progress in decimating core al Qaeda in the region between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 But there is an ongoing violent and dangerous threat that\'s emanating out of the Arabian Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\'re focused on, because the President believes and understands that his chief responsibility as President of the United States is the national security of the United States of America and her citizens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last thing on the NSA.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the President\'s news conference where he talked about a debate on the NSA issue and more transparency.\xc2\xa0 And then a few days after that news conference, we learned there were actually many violations of privacy.\xc2\xa0 The government says they were inadvertent, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 That debate continues.\xc2\xa0 But Congressman Amash was on one of the Sunday shows yesterday; he has been involved in this debate.\xc2\xa0 And he says that weeks, months ago when he approached the intelligence community, they told him no such violations had happened.\xc2\xa0 And then we learned last week that some of them did.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, is there a credibility gap here where the President is in a news conference saying we want more transparency, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- there\'s no privacy violations and yet it turns out there were?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not sure that\'s exactly the way that I would characterize the position that we\'ve maintained.\xc2\xa0 Let me start here.\xc2\xa0 When the President took office, he took office with what he described as an inherently skeptical perspective on some of these programs, and the success that these programs had had in striking the appropriate balance between the privacy rights that are enjoyed by American citizens and our national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Upon taking office, the President ordered a review of these programs.\xc2\xa0 As a result of that review, there are some additional protections that were put in place -- some additional oversight measures that were put in place and some additional measures to ensure transparency into these programs were put into place.</p>\n<p>Now, the President is not opposed -- as he indicated during his news conference -- to additional measures that members of Congress may think would be helpful in inspiring greater public confidence in these programs.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re happy to have that kind of conversation with members of Congress who feel strongly about this issue.\xc2\xa0 There are members of Congress in both parties who feel strongly about this issue.</p>\n<p>But the thing that\'s important for people to understand -- and the President thinks this is important, too -- we\'re talking about national security programs that are critical to the protection of our national security.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve heard national security professionals testify before Congress that these programs have been instrumental in disrupting terror plots all around the world.\xc2\xa0 They also are an important element of our cooperation with other countries in protecting the national security and the national security interests of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>So there is an important balance for us to strike here, and part of the success of these programs depends on public confidence in them.\xc2\xa0 So if there are steps that we can take to provide greater transparency or additional oversight in a way that it will inspire greater public confidence in them, then the President is eager to work with Democrats and Republicans in Congress to effectuate those changes.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on the unauthorized NSA surveillance, does the President stand by his statement of a few weeks ago that there is no spying on Americans?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the President does stand by that statement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there were 2,700 incidents of unauthorized surveillance.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The facts here are really, really important.\xc2\xa0 We saw -- and I actually read an op-ed from Mike Hayden, who served in the previous administration, where he pointed out that almost 70 percent of those violations that were included in that report were violations related to surveillance of foreign individuals who happened to temporarily be in the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 So understanding the facts of this complicated policy is important.</p>\n<p>I also want to produce two other things to remind you of -- point out two other things to you.\xc2\xa0 The first is I want to quote from Senator Diane Feinstein of California.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s the chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and she pointed out, \xe2\x80\x9cThe committee has never identified an instance in which the NSA has intentionally abused its authority to conduct surveillance for inappropriate purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not a surprise because Senator --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was that statement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That was last week.\xc2\xa0 I think she issued the statement on Thursday [Friday] of last week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, there is one other person I want to point out here, too, and that\xe2\x80\x99s Pete King, who is not in the President\xe2\x80\x99s party and not as inclined to agree with the President, and what he points out I think is something that\xe2\x80\x99s also important, which is that that The Washington Post report that got a lot of attention last week that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to was based on NSA compliance reports.\xc2\xa0 So the fact that this Washington Post story could be written in the first place is evidence there is rigorous oversight ongoing at the NSA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are compliance problems that were identified by the NSA, that were tabulated by the NSA, that were reported by the NSA to Congress in the appropriate fashion, and they are compliance issues that were -- where action was taken to rectify them.\xc2\xa0 So what this Post story illustrates is that there is in place at the NSA a very strict oversight regime.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Last thing, I want to just quote from Pete King who was asked about The Washington Post report, and he says -- he was asked whether or not there was a problem with the compliance system at the NSA, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a problem.\xc2\xa0 The fact is it worked.\xc2\xa0 If you have 99.99 percent compliance and you have self-reporting errors -- this came from an internal report, which then becomes part of an overall IG report.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He went on to say that it was all available and "there\'s nothing there that bothers me.\xc2\xa0 Quite frankly, that shows that the system works.\xc2\xa0 And it works.\xc2\xa0 We should be proud of it."\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is a conclusion that was reached by a Republican member of Congress who has quite a bit of experience with some of these issues, indicating his confidence in the oversight of these NSA programs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I recognize that there are members of Congress who have said there should be additional oversight or there should be greater transparency measures.\xc2\xa0 And the President is willing to work with those members of Congress to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>J.C.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the President and this administration that the present military government in Egypt may use access to the Suez Canal as a bargaining chip?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen those reports and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that prospect raised.\xc2\xa0 Suffice it to say, we value the working relationship that we have with the Egyptians.\xc2\xa0 And that is a relationship that goes back decades.\xc2\xa0 But we have been concerned about some of the steps that have been taken by the interim government to violate the civil rights of their people, to not follow through on their commitment to transition back to a democratically elected civilian government.</p>\n<p>So we\'ve made those concerns pretty clear not just to them in private conversations, but to all of you in the public pronouncements of the President and other senior administration officials.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I just quickly follow up?\xc2\xa0 How much support does the President intend to be receiving from his NATO allies like Great Britain, France and Germany, and the regional allies like Qatar as he moves to perhaps other initiatives?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Related to Egypt?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would say is that obviously these other countries will be making a determination on their own about their own national security interests.\xc2\xa0 But because you\'re talking about allies, it\'s reasonable to assume that those interests are largely going to overlap.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ll certainly be, and have been, consulting with our allies as they confront this policy challenge as well.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you just quoted from Senator Feinstein\'s comment.\xc2\xa0 But as I recall in The Washington Post article, to follow up on Mark\'s question, she commented to The Washington Post that she was not aware -- she and her staff were not aware of the compliance audits until The Washington Post asked her about them.\xc2\xa0 So my question to you is, are you misinformed about what she saw?\xc2\xa0 Was she telling The Washington Post something different?\xc2\xa0 Are we talking about two different reports?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it has anything to do with me being misinformed.\xc2\xa0 But if you have questions about her comments, then you should check with her.\xc2\xa0 I read to you her on-the-record statement on this issue.\xc2\xa0 I think what she may have been referring to in that report --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did you understand her to mean when she was quoted in the Post?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the story in front of me, so it\'s hard for me to see exactly what you\'re referring to.\xc2\xa0 I know that at least some members of Congress -- and I don\'t know whether or not it was Senator Feinstein -- have suggested that they didn\'t see these NSA reports that were reported on by The Washington Post.\xc2\xa0 But what they did see and what many of them were briefed on were the regular reports that are due to Congress from the NSA as part of their oversight function, that there are reports on a regular basis that are made to members of Congress oftentimes to the intelligence committees about some of these issues and some of the broader issues that allow Congress to fulfill their responsibility to conduct oversight over the NSA.</p>\n<p>That is cooperation that we\'re committed to.\xc2\xa0 But if there are members of Congress who have ideas about how we can strengthen that oversight and improve that oversight in a way that yields greater public confidence, then we\'re willing to work with them to make those changes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So included in that would be the President would consider making those audits public?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any specific proposals, and I don\'t know that anybody has proposed that either, because we\'re talking about classified confidential programs that are critical to our national security.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\'t make any broad promises like that.</p>\n<p>But if there are people who have looked at this issue that come to this from a perspective of conviction that have the best interest of American national security and the privacy rights of Americans at heart, then we\'re eager to sit down at the table and work with them to put in place measures that will inspire greater public confidence in these programs.</p>\n<p>These programs work better in protecting our national security when the American public has confidence in them.\xc2\xa0 And so if there are steps that we can take that will inspire great public confidence, then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with Congress to get that done.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, on a lighter note, I had a couple of questions I wanted to ask you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s appearance tomorrow with the \xe2\x80\x9972 Miami Dolphin NFL team.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The first question being where did the idea come up with -- to honor a team four decades after the fact?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 To be honest with you, I don\'t know whose idea it was.\xc2\xa0 But marking the 40th anniversary of their Super Bowl victory seems appropriate considering they won that Super Bowl at a time before NFL Super Bowl champions regularly visit the White House.\xc2\xa0 So this an opportunity for them to get the kind of White House visit that contemporary Super Bowl winning teams get to enjoy.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you the President is certainly looking forward to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Several members of that team, though --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you take that question on whose idea it was?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll look into it.</p>\n<p>Go ahead, Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Several members of that team said that they won\xe2\x80\x99t appear because of political differences with the President.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House disappointed about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, people are certainly allowed to make whatever decision they\xe2\x80\x99d like to make on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, do you have any more on the bus tour at the end of the week in terms of whether the President will actually be proposing anything new on college funding or education more broadly?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the bus tour is three days away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But I welcome your interest in this bus tour because I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I figured you would.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because I think it is going to be hopefully both fun and informative.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President does plan to have some new proposals that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be talking about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You want to share those just between us?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe later.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Not at this point, but in the next couple of days, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more information on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On what subject will the President --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President is going to be talking about his view that we need to rein in the skyrocketing costs of a college education, that never has a college education been more critical to the economic success of middle-class families in this country and if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure that middle-class families continue to have access to economic opportunity, that means that more students are going to need to have access to a high quality college education.\xc2\xa0 So we need to make sure that more middle-class families can get access to that college education, and that, frankly, families that are trying to get into the middle class also have the chance to afford a college education.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s generally what will be --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the whole thing is college, not more broadly pre-K and some of other proposals that the President --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The focus of the proposals that the President will be talking about will be higher education.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the fun part?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Beer pong and frats?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to Miami.\xc2\xa0 Maybe that would be on the agenda if we were doing that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the fun?\xc2\xa0 Why --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Getting on a bus for a couple of days and seeing America.\xc2\xa0 Sounds pretty good to me.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to it.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s fun.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be fun.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fun, it was just an interesting way to describe it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It should be good.\xc2\xa0 It should be good.</p>\n<p>Phil.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the Vice President going to join him at all on the bus tour?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the plan is for the Vice President currently -- the current plan is for the Vice President to join the President in his hometown of Scranton.\xc2\xa0 So that should be fun.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s fun.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 See.\xc2\xa0 It will be lots of fun.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Clashes between Turkey and Egypt are increasing.\xc2\xa0 On Sunday, Prime Minister Erdogan accused Egyptian authorities of committing a state of terrorism after nearly 600 people killed -- were killed on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 Turkish government recalled Turkish ambassador from Egypt and cancelled joint military exercises.\xc2\xa0 And my colleague from TRT, a reporter was captured by Egyptian forces, is still in custody, which is straining ties now further.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House share (inaudible) Prime Minister with Egyptian officials actions, and President is going to take some serious steps to stop this violence rather than just symbolic steps?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say to you a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One is the President did deliver a statement on Thursday where he strongly condemned the violence that was perpetrated by the interim Egyptian government against peaceful protesters.\xc2\xa0 That was a violation of human rights that the President strongly condemned.</p>\n<p>We have indicated that we\'re going to continue to review the assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s provided to the interim Egyptian government, and we\'re going to continue to call on the interim Egyptian government to follow through on their promises to transition back to a democratically elected civilian government.\xc2\xa0 And this is -- these are conversations that are ongoing between senior administration officials in this country and senior administration officials in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And the review of that assistance is ongoing.</p>\n<p>So our position on the violence that we saw last week in Egypt is very clear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on Egypt --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll do one more.\xc2\xa0 Steve, the last one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 We\'re sort of almost six months into the sequester now, and we\'re facing another deadline.\xc2\xa0 And so far, the White House strategy has not worked.\xc2\xa0 There\'s nothing moving through Congress that would roll it back.\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be any change in strategy?\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to be demanding a sequester fix before he\'ll sign a new spending bill for the next year?\xc2\xa0 Are there other things that the White House is considering doing to try and get Congress to act?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I understand that we\'re at the White House briefing and so you\'re justifiably reviewing the strategy of the White House when it comes to the budget.\xc2\xa0 I\'d just point out that House Republicans who have a similarly strong view on the sequester have tried to advance some of their proposals through their own conference that would factor in the sequester into a basic budgeting exercise, and they have been unable to advance that agenda as well.\xc2\xa0 We saw the recent failure of the transportation HUD bill in the appropriations committee in the House, and that is among House Republicans themselves.</p>\n<p>So again, your interest in our strategy is justified, but their strategy is relevant, too.\xc2\xa0 And it is clear that even on their own terms, Republicans are struggling to cobble together a strategy that members of their own party support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You\'re asking me how we\'re going to get members of the other party to support our strategy, so the terms here are a little bit different.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is there was an interesting story in The Washington Post again today about the impact of -- you guys are just killing it, Phil.\xc2\xa0 It\'s good stuff.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Put it in a PR.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There was a story about the impact of the sequester on the Head Start program and how there are thousands of kids who will not be able to benefit from the Head Start program because of the sequester, that there are more than a million hours of Head Start instruction that was eliminated because of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 So the impact of the sequester on basic education programs is something that the President is seriously concerned about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He\'s seriously concerned about the impact that the sequester has had and could have moving forward on our national security.\xc2\xa0 The President has already articulated his concern about the impact that the sequester will have on economic growth and job creation moving forward.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen some pretty concerning studies from the CBO that\xe2\x80\x99s conducted an analysis indicating that job creation will not be as strong and economic growth will not be as robust because of the sequester.</p>\n<p>So this is a problem that needs to get fixed.\xc2\xa0 But at the end of the day, the framers of the Constitution delegated budgetary authority to the United States Congress, so members of Congress in both parties are going to have to come together and figure out a way that they can pass a budget that will protect these critical investments in the middle class.</p>\n<p>The President has put forward his own proposal -- this is the -- I would remind you -- this seems like ancient history, but the President put forward his own proposal that would protect these critical investments in education; make important, long-overdue investments in infrastructure; and actually do more to reduce the deficit than the sequester does.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\'ve got our proposal out there.\xc2\xa0 Republicans have put forward a proposal that Republicans themselves don\xe2\x80\x99t even support.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, at the end of the day, Congress is the one that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to come together and figure this out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>One last thing.\xc2\xa0 For years, we saw House Republicans suggesting that the best way for us to resolve some of these budgetary issues was through the regular order.\xc2\xa0 And so what they did was they insisted that the Senate pass a budget -- the Democratic-led Senate passed a budget.\xc2\xa0 The Democratic-led Senate passed a budget.\xc2\xa0 So the next step in that process is the appointment of conferees.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner has refused to appoint conferees to that process.\xc2\xa0 So the person who was the leading advocate for the regular order budget process is now doing more than anyone to gum up the regular order budget process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Speaker Boehner has, right before the break, put out his own marker and said that the sequester is going to stay until the President comes forward with a plan for alternative, smarter cuts.\xc2\xa0 And up until now, the White House has said we need tax increases, we need revenue in addition to other spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to continue to insist on tax increases to get rid of the sequester?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I want to go back to this because this is important.\xc2\xa0 The most important thing for you to understand is that marker that Speaker Boehner laid out is not even supported by members of his own party, members of his own conference.\xc2\xa0 The people who voted to make him Speaker of the House don\xe2\x80\x99t support that when you get down into the budget-making process.</p>\n<p>So, again, I welcome your interest in our strategy about how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to put forward a budget, but ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to do it and so far, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen congressional leaders on the Republican side unable to build support in their own party for their own strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear where the -- who is responsible right now for where we stand in this budget process.\xc2\xa0 What the President has said is that he is willing to work with Republicans in Congress to try to find common ground, but at the end of the day, the President is not going to sign a budget agreement that undermines important investments, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t act in the best interest of middle-class families in this country.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the criteria the President is going to use to evaluate a budget deal, but ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s up to Congress to get to work to solve this problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the sequester has to go.\xc2\xa0 Something has to be done.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s sounding like --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m pointing out to you that there are House Republicans who are unable to pass what I think what is among the least politically risky appropriations budgets because the sequester was too onerous and they were unable to budget under that criteria.\xc2\xa0 So for the Speaker of the House to stand there and insist that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to stick to that seems, at best, unreasonable, considering he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the support of his own party to do it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but you just said the President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sign something that undermines --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President has said a couple of times already here, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But yet he has also said the sequester does undermine a whole bunch of things --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does, including the Head Start program that was reported by The Washington Post today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to come back in September insist the sequester --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I welcome your interest in our budget strategy because we\xe2\x80\x99re at the White House briefing, but I think there are some elements of this that will play out down the road.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:16 P.M.
