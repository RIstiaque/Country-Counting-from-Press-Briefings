EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So let\'s do this and then we can all eat.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a great pleasure to have you aboard Air Force One as we leave snowy Denver for what I am told is sunny and warm Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 It\'s been a great trip. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President, this morning, was able to speak to a University of Colorado-Denver crowd about his new initiative to assist students, former students with the burden of their student loans, easing that burden a little bit through some initiatives he announced, the details of which you have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s part of an effort that he\'s undertaken to do everything he can, broadly speaking, to help people in this difficult economy, put people back to work, and help the economy grow.\xc2\xa0 Because while he makes very clear that executive action is not a substitute for legislative action, he will do everything he can within his power to address the number-one priority that the American people have.\xc2\xa0 And so you can expect that he will continue to do that in the coming days, weeks and months.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you at all concerned that, when people start seeing the details of these actions, they might learn that they, by their very nature, are somewhat limited?\xc2\xa0 And, for instance, what he announced today is not going to alleviate the true burden of student debt for most people, so --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is -- to suggest that an initiative doesn\'t entirely solve a problem, that makes it not worth doing, is I think a faulty analysis at best.\xc2\xa0 When you tell it to what I think is 1.6 million students who would be assisted and see their burden reduced by this -- by the initiatives that would simply move up the program that was going to start in 2014 and start it in 2012 -- I mean, if our economic problems or challenges were solvable by two or three proposals, I think we\'d be done already.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as the President says, the hole we found ourselves in, as a country, because of the great recession was very, very deep. And we didn\'t get there overnight, and we won\'t climb out of it overnight.\xc2\xa0 But we are climbing out of it.\xc2\xa0 And this President is committed to doing everything he can, through working with Congress and working with his executive powers, to assist Americans -- middle-class Americans who are struggling in this economy to do better.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, speaking of debt burdens, what\'s the current level of concern about the seeming inability of the Europeans to come to terms with the issue there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, we are very engaged in this. Secretary Geithner has been in constant contact with his counterparts.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, has also been in communication with a fair amount of regularity with European leaders on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And we have made clear that we believe that the Europeans have the financial capacity to deal with this challenge and they need to meet that capacity with political will that\'s necessary to meet it, and that they need to take action that will conclusively deal with this challenge -- which, of course, is important not just because these countries are all our allies, it\'s a very, very important part of the world, but because the situation in Europe creates headwinds for the American economy.\xc2\xa0 And this President is, again, very focused on doing everything he can to grow this economy and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the assumption of where that situation is going to be when he gets to the G20 table next week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to make predictions about the future, but we continue to discuss with and urge our European counterparts to take conclusive action to deal with this problem in a timely fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They were having a big meeting today in Brussels.\xc2\xa0 Has he been briefed about that?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to talk to anybody about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any readouts to give you or previews to give you of phone calls or discussions he may have, but he is, of course, being kept up to date, as he is every day, on events around the world, including in Europe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 China has agreed to come out and help the Europeans, investing in the bailout fund.\xc2\xa0 Is there any sense that the U.S. might do that in the future?\xc2\xa0 Is that off the table, whether or not the U.S. would intervene?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe so.\xc2\xa0 I would ask that you maybe direct that question to Secretary -- rather, to the Treasury Department.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\'t believe so on what?\xc2\xa0 Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That the U.S. would provide assistance directly to the Europeans.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s not my understanding that\'s our position.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask an Iraq question?\xc2\xa0 There have been some reports that the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t get very personally involved in the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Given that a lot of this had to do with Iraqi politics and unable to get to immunity, does it also show that ultimately the administration just didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was necessary --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m glad you asked that, Scott, because that report is just categorically false to suggest that the President and the Vice President hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been in communication with Iraqi leaders, and it turns out that\'s wrong.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President had many, many conversations with Iraqi leaders over the time period mentioned in that story.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke with Prime Minister Maliki this summer.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s simply erroneous. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, as we discussed and the President announced, the President is keeping his commitment to draw down U.S. forces to zero at the end of this year; to end the American war in Iraq in a responsible way that honors the remarkable sacrifice and service of our men and women in uniform, as well as our civilian personnel, and gives Iraq the best opportunity to build a prosperous and democratic future. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We will continue to have a vital and important relationship with Iraq in the years ahead.\xc2\xa0 The Strategic Framework Agreement, as you know, Scott, is very, very important to the Iraqis and it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to us.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to build on that.\xc2\xa0 We want a normal relationship, the kind of relationship we have with sovereign nations around the world -- which is why we are so puzzled by those who suggest that keeping this commitment is somehow not the right thing to do, when it was a commitment signed by President Bush, first of all, and secondly, it is -- by fulfilling this commitment, we\xe2\x80\x99re demonstrating the fact that largely because of, or certainly in part because of the remarkable efforts by our American men and women in uniform and civilians, Iraq is now in control of its destiny, and able to secure its own country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That has been the case step by step in this process.\xc2\xa0 When the President said we would remove U.S. forces from Iraqi cities by the summer of 2009, people said, oh, well, that will be terrible, it will -- these critics said that will be terrible and cause a dramatic increase in violence.\xc2\xa0 The opposite happened. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Same thing when the President said we\xe2\x80\x99d draw down to 50,000 troops and end our combat mission -- the situation improved.\xc2\xa0 And it improved because of the remarkable work that our forces have done with the Iraqi security forces. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President is very confident that this is a course of action that is good for the United States and good for Iraq.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there any record then of all these calls that you say occurred?\xc2\xa0 Because the McClatchy report looked at embassy logs --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There was actually a readout of at least one of these calls that they seem to have missed.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is, as you know, Jim, we don\xe2\x80\x99t read out every call we have, the President has or the Vice President has with foreign leaders. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Vice President, as you know because he was asked to basically oversee our Iraq policy by the President at the beginning of this term, was throughout my time working for him and has continued to be in regular consultation and contact with Iraqi leaders, as well as other interlocutors who have worked with us on Iraq, including the United Nations and others.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m puzzled by the piece.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In light of that, though, will you be producing some of the logs or records --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, to produce -- to prove an utterly false story, I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- and, again, some of this stuff has been read out.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you, as a fact, that the Vice President was in regular consultation with the Iraqi leaders.\xc2\xa0 The President had a conversation with Prime Minister Maliki this summer.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m puzzled by it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President was interrupted today by some protestors about the Keystone Pipeline, and he responded by saying their concerns would be addressed.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on Keystone and what role is he playing in the decision-making?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you heard the President address this in his remarks.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of him.\xc2\xa0 The State Department is obviously the agency tasked with -- as a matter of precedent -- with evaluating this and making a decision.\xc2\xa0 The President said today that he understands the concerns of those who have expressed themselves, as some did today.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of that decision or get ahead of the President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- it will be by the end of the year like the State Department originally said, a decision --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the latest is on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he weighing in on it at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Friends of the Earth have argued and have emails that show some relationship between the Canadian company and some State Department officials.\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned about that, or has he looked at that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more on that for you.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that discussion with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you respond to Paul Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s comments today that suggest that the President has not lived up to the promise that he set out when he launched his presidential campaign?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is the speech that Congressman Ryan gave about -- decrying the politics of division, which he gave at a conservative think tank, a very partisan conservative think tank, in which he then spent most of his speech criticizing and attacking the President?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the speech you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the speech I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do have something to say about that.\xc2\xa0 This President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to trying to overcome the kind of divisive politics is at the core of who he is as a leader and a politician.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, despite what Congressman Ryan says, the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach, is viewed even recently -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m citing somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s work here that I saw, a little item -- even recently cited in a Fox News poll with a somewhat leading question about, do you believe that the approach the President is taking is bringing people together or is he deliberately dividing people -- 56 to 32 said the former.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what was that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Said that his approach is trying to bring people together.\xc2\xa0 This is his current approach to these problems. And that is the approach he\xe2\x80\x99s taken.\xc2\xa0 This President, from the beginning, has tried repeatedly to work with Republicans, and has successfully worked with them on a number of issues. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would simply remind Congressman Ryan that the Republican leader in the other body, the Senate, made clear in public statements that his number-one priority wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to work with Democrats, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to work with the President, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to get things done in a way that the American people want them to get done, but to -- his number-one priority, as he said explicitly, was to do everything he could to assure that President Obama was not reelected.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like politics of division to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More importantly, again -- and this is not about Congressman Ryan\'s motives or sincerity of his beliefs, but he put forward a budget plan that would give an average of a $200,000 tax cut to the average millionaire, and through the voucherization of Medicare, heap extraordinary new burdens on senior citizens in America.\xc2\xa0 That seems pretty divisive to me.\xc2\xa0 It\'s certainly not an approach that the American people support.\xc2\xa0 And I would contrast it with the kind of support the American people in survey after survey have shown for the approach the President is taking. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What else do we have here?\xc2\xa0 There\'s a familiar refrain that we heard in the speech about going after small business and punitive tax hikes on job creators -- something I always find interesting because by the way Republicans define small businesses, did you know that more than 200 of the 400 highest earning people in America, people whose average annual income is $271 million -- that they\'re small business owners because they\'re in partnership with law firms and other things, and that those are the jobs -- the small business owners that they say shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be paying a little extra.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- responded by talking about a lot of what Republicans have done that\'s been divisive.\xc2\xa0 But what about just sort of addressing the core of what he\'s saying?\xc2\xa0 President Obama came to prominence, his whole political rise was based on the promise of bringing people together, and at the end of the day --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been very candid about this, that it\'s been -- that it has been a very difficult task, but it is one that he remains committed to.\xc2\xa0 And again, I know because I was there, that he went to extraordinary efforts from the very beginning of his administration to work with Republicans in a bipartisan way to take the necessary measures to prevent what was a catastrophic situation for our economy from becoming a second Great Depression -- and measure after measure where he sought Republican support.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think we know now from what we\'ve heard quite explicitly from Republican leaders is that their priority was to prevent the President from getting that bipartisan support because they thought it was politically advantageous for them to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 But the President still believes that we can work together because that\'s what -- not because he has some power to make it happen, but because the American people really are fed up with the continual dysfunction we find in Washington.\xc2\xa0 You see it again and again and again when you talk to folks out in the country and you see it in data -- they\'re just fed up with that dysfunction.\xc2\xa0 They\'re fed up with people putting party ahead of country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he believes that he\'s going to keep taking a pickaxe to the rock and try to break down that kind of resistance to the sort of bipartisan cooperation that he believes the American people are crying out for. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, I mean, he could have crafted an American Jobs Act, a proposal that was filled with ideas that only Democrats had ever supported.\xc2\xa0 Democrats would have thought, perhaps, that was a good idea.\xc2\xa0 Instead, he put it -- filled it with ideas that Republicans have traditionally supported as well, not just Democrats -- because he wanted it passed because he thought it was the right thing to do for the country, and he was realistic about the need to put something forward that Republicans could support -- because they have in the past.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, that, as of yet, has not occurred.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, returning to the student loan question, just a kind of a technical question.\xc2\xa0 You said, the White House has said that it\'s no cost to taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 But if you\'re consolidating the loans and lowering the rate by half a point, don\'t you end up with a loss -- some loss of revenue out of that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I believe that there is an overall actual savings, reduction to the deficit through this program.\xc2\xa0 I would -- I\'ll have to steer you to the policy experts on how that works.\xc2\xa0 But it is actually a deficit reducer, not a -- no burden to the taxpayer.\xc2\xa0 And I know that there are GOP talking points out there that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- an expectation that more would pay back --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me see if I can find some data -- I know that there\'s been people out there discussing -- conference calls that have been had and policy people talking to your colleagues about how this will work.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re very confident that, contrary to the criticism from some quarters, that far from being a burden on taxpayers, this will be a deficit reducer -- and a huge help to students all across the country who are heavily burdened by this student debt.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said, this has become a major, major problem for Americans, and he thinks it\'s the right thing to do to try to help them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you tell us anything about the unpublicized meeting that the President had in L.A. yesterday with Hollywood executives?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has lots of meetings.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have -- I saw that report, like a secret meeting.\xc2\xa0 Did that mean did he have a secret meeting with the motorcade drivers and the police officers that he does every time?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he has conversations that aren\xe2\x80\x99t on the public schedule.\xc2\xa0 But I think it was just talking to supporters.\xc2\xa0 It was not a campaign event in the sense that it was not -- there was no -- it was not a fundraiser.\xc2\xa0 It was just a discussion -- brief, very brief, like 10 minutes -- with some supporters.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you think of Rick Perry\xe2\x80\x99s flat tax, and the claim that his economic policies will create 2.5 million jobs if he\xe2\x80\x99s elected?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I confess I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to evaluate it yet, or to talk to our folks here about it.\xc2\xa0 Our belief is that we need to, through tax reform, make sure that we don\'t shift an even greater burden on the middle class.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- going back to Laura\xe2\x80\x99s question about Congressman Ryan -- I think he was asked about -- the new CBO report, the nonpartisan CBO report, that demonstrates the remarkable transformation that\xe2\x80\x99s been happening in this country with a greater and greater concentration of wealth among the very, very top earners in this country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you know what, the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach is we want to make sure that more people have that kind of upward mobility; more people can move up from the lower rungs to the middle class, from the middle class higher and higher.\xc2\xa0 And, unfortunately, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is a reduction in the kind of opportunities, and in part because of some of the policies. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The middle class does not deserve new, added burdens.\xc2\xa0 They do not deserve tax hikes.\xc2\xa0 They do not deserve, we think, policies that actually would benefit those who have already benefited so greatly in the last decade -- a time when middle class incomes stagnated or even declined.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance, again, to look at that particular plan.\xc2\xa0 I know that that is often the issue with so-called flat tax plans, is that what they end up being very, very regressive and even -- I believe the flat tax plan proposed by one of the other candidates in the Republican primaries has been criticized by other Republicans for doing that, for shifting the tax burden away from -- onto the middle class and giving greater tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is the President doing right now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Last I -- I talked to him right before I came out.\xc2\xa0 He asked me if I was going to gaggle.\xc2\xa0 I said, yes, I was. He said to say hello.\xc2\xa0 He hopes you enjoyed your trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why does he so rarely come back here, Jay, and talk to reporters --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he has come back a couple of times on my watch.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that he gives a lot of press conferences and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\'ll be back to say hello in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you have a comment on the State Department spending $70,000 on President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s books?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I saw that.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 What I do know, because we looked into it -- obviously the White House didn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do with this --I think this is an embassy-by-embassy based decision, based on what they think is, in buying books, makes sense to them in terms of advancing American foreign policy interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, I see in some paper that a lot of these embassies have books by Colin Powell or George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan.\xc2\xa0 But, again, in terms of this particular news story, I would refer you to the State Department.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 2:56 P.M.
