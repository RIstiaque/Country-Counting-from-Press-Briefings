EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you for joining us on this leg of this trip as we make our way from Florida to the Buckeye State.\xc2\xa0 Always a pleasure to return to Ohio, especially Dayton.</p>\n<p>I have no announcements at the top.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps Jen does.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 So I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen this and your organizations have reported on this, but I just wanted to re-flag that we launched this morning a full-scale, multi-platform, organizational effort that will include direct mail advertisements and distribution at field offices to ensure every voter knows what a second term of an Obama presidency would mean for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 You saw the President do it this morning. The Vice President did it.\xc2\xa0 I expect this will be a consistent part of their stump speeches moving forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is us using our -- enlisting our grassroots army across the country to remind their friends and neighbors, remind their cousins, roommates, brothers and sisters, the stakes in this election, why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important to get registered, get engaged and, of course, to vote on or before November 6th.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s two weeks before the election.\xc2\xa0 Is the move by the campaign putting out this blueprint an acknowledgement at all that the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t provided enough clarity on what he would do with a second term?\xc2\xa0 And if he had provided enough clarity, why would you have to put out something like this?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, throughout the course of the last several months as the President has been out there campaigning nearly every day, and in his speech that he delivered at the convention, he laid out these exact specific plans, the exact specifics about what he would want to do moving forward.</p>\n<p>We know that people are continuing to tune in.\xc2\xa0 We know that some people are still making decisions.\xc2\xa0 And we just feel this is a pivotal time to engage our grassroots supporters across the country, make sure they have the tools they need to do what the President does on his stump every day.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s more about making sure we\xe2\x80\x99re providing people with the information they need to encourage their friends, neighbors, cousins, brothers, sisters and roommates to do exactly what the President has been doing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Because we know, as much as he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be out there every day, we have ads on the air, he does interviews nearly every day, people also get their information from all different places.\xc2\xa0 And this is an opportunity to really take advantage of our strength, which is the millions of energized grassroots supporters we have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President last night -- I\xe2\x80\x99m paraphrasing, but he said there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a sequester.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, is that something new for him, or did you feel like that\xe2\x80\x99s a continuation of what his position has always been?\xc2\xa0 How can he be so sure?\xc2\xa0 And is he saying that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be one because he\xe2\x80\x99s going to stop it, or because the Republicans will blink first?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What the President said last night was a reiteration of what his position has long been, which is that the sequester, which was designed and passed by Congress, was never meant to become policy.\xc2\xa0 It was never meant to be implemented.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a designed trigger, a forcing mechanism to compel Congress to make the difficult decisions required to reach a balanced deficit reduction package.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is confident that Congress will take the appropriate action to achieve a balanced deficit reduction package in order to avoid these onerous cuts in both defense and non-defense discretionary spending that were written into the law by Congress.</p>\n<p>I would simply note when it comes to the enforcement mechanism here, the trigger, that the President\xe2\x80\x99s position throughout the negotiations last summer, when the final preparations for the Budget Control Act were being worked out, has always been a trigger to include revenue.\xc2\xa0 That was the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.\xc2\xa0 If the trigger had been balanced, if it had included not just cuts in defense and cuts in non-defense discretionary spending, but also revenue, the cuts would have been less deep in both non-defense and discretionary spending.</p>\n<p>As they have consistently, Republicans, especially in the House, adamantly refuse to include balance in the triggering mechanism.\xc2\xa0 They made a decision that they would rather see steeper cuts in defense and non-defense spending programs than ask millionaires and billionaires to pay a single dollar extra.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is unfortunate, but the President remains confident that we will be able to move forward, there will be a balanced deficit reduction package, because there is a growing consensus behind that very proposition that we have to have balance.\xc2\xa0 We have to have serious cuts in our spending, but also we have to ask millionaires and billionaires to pay a little bit extra.</p>\n<p>One step that the House of Representatives could take tomorrow, if they saw fit to return to Washington to do a little work, would be to pass the bill the President proposed and the Senate passed, which would make sure that 98 percent of the American people did not see their taxes go up on January 1st.\xc2\xa0 That would alleviate some of the so-called fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 And if Republicans were serious about addressing that issue, they would pass that bill tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question for Jen.\xc2\xa0 So as we discussed this morning, there\xe2\x80\x99s a perception among many that this race is in dead heat and that Governor Romney could actually win.\xc2\xa0 How does it feel to be in a race like that?\xc2\xa0 Or do you reject that premise?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, we always thought this would be a very close race.\xc2\xa0 It is a close race.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re out here pounding the pavement every single day, speaking to as many voters as possible, upping our phone calls and door-knocking out of our field offices.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re exactly where we thought the race would be.</p>\n<p>I do want to dispute a couple of points that I know our friends on the Romney team are making.\xc2\xa0 One is, we\xe2\x80\x99re out-performing our early vote margins in key states compared to 2008. We\xe2\x80\x99re ahead of where we were against John McCain.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a really important point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Two is, the electorate is bigger this year and our vote margins are, too.\xc2\xa0 So in every presidential election since 1984, the turnout in the presidential year -- and many of you know this, as political reporters -- has eclipsed turnout in midterm elections.\xc2\xa0 In every presidential election since 1996, the voter turnout has increased significantly over the previous election.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t think this year will be any more different.\xc2\xa0 In fact, more people will early vote this cycle than in 2008.</p>\n<p>Another important point, my third point, I will say, is that the Romney campaign has said in all their chatter about their momentum that young people and minorities won\xe2\x80\x99t turn out.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in any stretch of the word.\xc2\xa0 One, early vote helps us get out low-propensity voters, people who haven\xe2\x80\x99t voted before, less likely voters, and frees up more to get out the vote -- and our resources later on, especially leading up to Election Day.</p>\n<p>And two, the electorate has become consistently more diverse.\xc2\xa0 And minority voting, as far as we estimate, will probably reach an all-time high this year, which is contrary to what our opponent is predicting.</p>\n<p>So we know we have 14 days to go.\xc2\xa0 This race is going to be incredibly close -- razor thin in some places -- until the end.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re up or tied within the margin of error in every single swing state.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly where we thought it would be.\xc2\xa0 We feel good about the resources we have.\xc2\xa0 We feel great about our second-to-none ground game.\xc2\xa0 And we think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to feel good when we\xe2\x80\x99re sleeping on November 7th.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 What do you think the effect of last night\xe2\x80\x99s debate will be, especially given that the economy seems to be the major issue?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I think everyone agrees on that.\xc2\xa0 The President had a very strong and steady performance.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s broad agreement on that by people who were watching.\xc2\xa0 And people watching at home I think saw the Commander-in-Chief who they elected four years ago -- who promised to end the war in Iraq and did; who promised to lay out a timeline for winding down our presence in Afghanistan and has; who has restored our presence in the world, brought together a coalition to hold Iran accountable; and remains committed to holding China\xe2\x80\x99s feet to the fire when they\xe2\x80\x99re not evening the playing field and keeping -- evening the playing field for American workers.</p>\n<p>There were a number of economic issues that were discussed last night, as you know -- some that were linked to foreign affairs, some that were not.\xc2\xa0 I expect when we go to Ohio later this afternoon that people watching in Ohio last night, one of the pieces that was most interesting to them was the discussion on China.\xc2\xa0 The President has a very strong record he stands behind.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s put in place more than twice the number of -- he\xe2\x80\x99s taken more than twice the number of trade enforcement actions than the past administration. And he has acted tough, not just talked tough.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He\xe2\x80\x99ll talk this afternoon -- I expect to hear more on autos than he even said this morning, and why this is important, and why this matters to the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But just to sum it up, I think a strong performance like the President had last night energizes our supporters just like the second performance did.\xc2\xa0 They see a Commander-in-Chief who\xe2\x80\x99s going to stand up for them, who\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep this country safe, and also a Commander-in-Chief who wants to make sure that America is continuing to lead in the global economy.\xc2\xa0 And that means being tough on China when we need to be tough.\xc2\xa0 That means making sure that the playing field is even for workers across the country, including in Ohio.\xc2\xa0 And I expect you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him continue to talk about that today and in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the United States interested in having bilateral talks with Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You heard the President say last night that it has been his policy since he took office that he is open to considering bilateral talks with Iran in order to assure that Iran meets its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 His red line is that Iran cannot and must not acquire a nuclear weapon, and he reiterated that position very strongly and forcefully last night.</p>\n<p>His approach, which he launched when he took office, was to rally the international community behind a set of sanctions and diplomatic isolation that has put more pressure on Iran than it has ever felt; has caused great damage to the Iranian economy -- and the Iranian people have their leaders to blame for that -- and has isolated Iran like never before.\xc2\xa0 When he took office, as you know, the world was divided on this issue and Iran was resurgent.\xc2\xa0 The opposite is true today because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>His approach has always been dual-track -- increasing pressure, increasing isolation, increasing international consensus against Iran because of its failure to live up to its obligations, because of its refusal to give up its nuclear ambition, on the one hand, on the one track.\xc2\xa0 And on the second track, a willingness and openness to engage in serious bilateral negotiations -- either bilateral or through the P5-plus-1 -- that has always been his approach.</p>\n<p>But the President made clear the window of opportunity here will not remain open forever, and he will not tolerate -- if we get to the point of negotiation with Iran -- endless negotiations or negotiations that serve merely as a stall tactic.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s red line is the President\xe2\x80\x99s red line.\xc2\xa0 He will take every action necessary to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the second track, can you tell us what types of steps are being made or taken right now to achieve the bilateral talks between the two sides?\xc2\xa0 How close are you to getting to that point?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have no talks on the schedule.\xc2\xa0 We have no agreement with the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 We obviously are and have been interested in pursuing negotiations with the Iranians through the P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 We have been open to considering negotiations that are bilateral, but we have none scheduled and we have no agreement with the Iranians to do that.</p>\n<p>What the President made clear last night is that he will continue to apply relentless pressure on the Iranians, on the regime, until the Iranians make the fateful decision to abide by their international obligations and to give up their nuclear ambitions -- nuclear weapons ambitions in a verifiable way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that position has not changed.\xc2\xa0 And I think that it was quite clear last night in the debate that we have gotten to a situation because of the approach the President took that Iran is in dire straits economically; divided politically; its exports of oil are down dramatically.\xc2\xa0 And that has created a situation where Iran needs to make a decision.\xc2\xa0 Because this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment is clear:\xc2\xa0 As long as he\xe2\x80\x99s President, he is committed to ensuring that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there informal talks going on right now between U.S. officials and Iranian officials to set something like this up after the election?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is nothing scheduled.\xc2\xa0 There is no agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there talks going on --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are constantly in conversations with our\xc2\xa0 P5-plus-1 partners.\xc2\xa0 We are and have been open to pursuing negotiations if and when the Iranians are serious about having negotiations.\xc2\xa0 But we have nothing to announce and there is nothing scheduled or no -- and there is no agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, can you tell us what the President is doing while he\xe2\x80\x99s in transit -- anything about taking phone calls?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Wednesday and Thursday, on our trip tomorrow, the President will be -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details for you on this tomorrow -- but part of his America Forward trip we\xe2\x80\x99re kicking off bright and early tomorrow morning -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many of you are lucky enough to be joining us -- but is reaching out to undecided voters.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be making some phone calls on the plane.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details for you on that tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And he\xe2\x80\x99ll also be making some local stops and meeting with supporters, some undecided voters, some people that are going to be pivotal to our plan to win 270 electoral votes, and getting them out and participating in this process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s -- as you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just every event on the ground.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also moments when he\xe2\x80\x99s on the plane and moments when he\xe2\x80\x99s in the car.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details for you as it progresses on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any firewalls you have to build in terms of his campaigning from the plane?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything, like, if you get a special phone or anything like that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how that works, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did either of you or both of you speak with the President last night or this morning?\xc2\xa0 And can you talk to us about his reaction immediately after the debate and how he thinks that changes the momentum or whatever -- how he approaches the next couple of weeks?\xc2\xa0 Was he surprised by anything last night about how Governor Romney approached the debate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we both spoke with him.\xc2\xa0 We both spoke with him.\xc2\xa0 He felt that he was able to articulate his vision for America\xe2\x80\x99s role in the world; that he was able to forcefully explain the decisions he\xe2\x80\x99s made, and make the important point that when you are Commander-in-Chief you have to be clear and decisive, even when you\xe2\x80\x99re making decisions that aren\xe2\x80\x99t popular. And I think he felt good about his performance last night.\xc2\xa0 I know that we all felt very good about it.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I agree.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one more question about the new plan for today?\xc2\xa0 So the folks who cover this regularly, more than I do, analyzed it and said that there\xe2\x80\x99s really not much new in it, since it\xe2\x80\x99s stuff that he\xe2\x80\x99s said before, and you sort of said that, too.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, what\xe2\x80\x99s the strategy behind that?\xc2\xa0 Was there a concern that the criticism that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a second-term agenda was starting to take hold?\xc2\xa0 Is that at all why he did it?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 One, I have a manila envelope I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to offer to the Romney campaign that he can put his $5 trillion tax cut plan in, which is one page.\xc2\xa0 Ours is a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In a binder?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 No, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even need a binder.\xc2\xa0 A manila folder will do just fine.\xc2\xa0 Two, the President has accomplished a great deal in his first term, which he talks about on the campaign trail nearly every day -- making sure people have access to affordable health care; passing the biggest tax cut for middle-class families into law; giving more kids the opportunity to go to college; taking steps to reform our education system.\xc2\xa0 But his job isn\xe2\x80\x99t done yet.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s more he wants to do.</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s part of his message to the American people.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen great progress in our manufacturing sector, he made tough choices to save the auto industry, but we need to do more. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he wants to create 1 million manufacturing jobs.\xc2\xa0 It builds on the success he\xe2\x80\x99s had to date.\xc2\xa0 He has taken tough steps, including putting in place the car rule, bringing together many different, opposing, sometimes adversaries to get that done, which has helped us increase [sic] oil imports.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something he thinks we can do more of.</p>\n<p>He\xe2\x80\x99s laid out a plan to wind down our troop presence in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to follow through on that, and use some of those savings to pay down our deficit and also continue to rebuild here at home.</p>\n<p>So he\xe2\x80\x99s building on plans that he\xe2\x80\x99s already had some success in, but there\xe2\x80\x99s more work he wants to do.\xc2\xa0 And he says this almost every day, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve come too far to turn back now.\xc2\xa0 So his message to the American people is, send me back; I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be the fighter for you in the White House.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to continue to build on the successes we\xe2\x80\x99ve had.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m a better choice than the guy that I\xe2\x80\x99m running against.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I say, as a matter of policy, throughout this year and prior to that, the President has put forward concrete proposals that you in the press and others have been able to evaluate, have been able to take to outside, independent economists and have those economists judge on the merits.\xc2\xa0 That stands in stark contrast to the proposals that have been put forward by Republicans, including Governor Romney.</p>\n<p>The President put forward an American Jobs Act that outside, independent economists to this day say if the portions that weren\xe2\x80\x99t passed were passed tomorrow would put a million more Americans back on the job.\xc2\xa0 The President supports a policy that -- supports a bill that passed the Senate and is languishing in the House that would ensure that 98 percent of the American people would not have their taxes go up on January 1st.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Independent economists will tell you, because it is a fact\xc2\xa0 -- it is an economic fact that tax cuts for the middle class help those families, but they also help the economy.\xc2\xa0 Tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires are not economically effective when it comes to creating growth and jobs.\xc2\xa0 That is a fact.</p>\n<p>The difference here, when you look at the assessments made by independent economists of alternative plans, could not be more clear.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward a proposal that would reduce the deficit by $4 trillion.\xc2\xa0 In principle, it mirrors the balance that was put forward by the Simpson-Bowles Commission, by the Domenici-Rivlin Commission.\xc2\xa0 It has been poked and prodded and assessed by outside economists and it has judged -- it has been judged to be true, in the claims about it that the President and his team have made.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That could not be more different from the proposals put forward by Republicans, including Governor Romney.\xc2\xa0 And I think at some point, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to acknowledge that, as a matter of policy, there is a great deal of substance and fact behind what the President has put forward, and that is very different from what we\'ve seen from the other side.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 And one thing to add.\xc2\xa0 After the convention, when he laid out his specific five-point plan that builds on his accomplishments and goals in the first term, we saw a bump in the polls.\xc2\xa0 People were paying attention.\xc2\xa0 They liked what they saw. They liked what they heard.\xc2\xa0 And we know that we need to keep reminding people across the country of what the differences are between what they\xe2\x80\x99re presenting.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s a big part of our strategy here.</p>\n<p>And if everybody on November 7th has a copy of the plan and has it in their backpacks, has it on their iPad, is looking at it online, then great, then that\'s been a success.\xc2\xa0 And then people will be with us as we\'re pursuing a second term.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is part of that also a desire to have a positive message and agenda to sort of go with Romnesia, some of the attacks that he\xe2\x80\x99s made?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know you haven\xe2\x80\x99t spent a ton of time with us out here.\xc2\xa0 The President -- the rest of his stump speech nearly every single day -- and I\'ve been out here almost every single day since July, and Jay far longer than that -- has been about his positive agenda for the country, what he wants to do moving forward.\xc2\xa0 He talks about the pieces in this plan every day.\xc2\xa0 He talks about the importance of fighting for access to affordable health care every day.\xc2\xa0 He talks about the middle-class tax cut every day.</p>\n<p>There is a difference and there is a choice in this election.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s part of what people will be making their decisions on.\xc2\xa0 And certainly we feel it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate and right for him to be laying that out, so that certainly is a part of what he talks about as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Have you had enough?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We can talk more.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk housing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Joking.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, guys.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:06 P.M. EDT\xc2\xa0</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
