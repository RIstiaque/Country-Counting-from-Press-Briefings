EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I have with me a special guest at the briefing today.\xc2\xa0 Sitting to my right is Adam Szubin.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about him in the briefing a lot -- (laughter) -- as I told him.\xc2\xa0 I told him it was all good stuff, so I hope you guys will back me up on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, obviously, Adam and his office play a very central role in a number of our national security priorities, including shutting down ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to finance their operations.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that Adam is here today is that, tomorrow, his boss, Secretary Lew, will be convening a meeting of the *National [U.N.] Security Council at the U.N. to discuss how we can further integrate and intensify our efforts to shut down ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd obviously this is something that Adam works on every day, and so I thought this would be a good occasion for him to both help you understand exactly what will be discussed at the meeting, but also describe to you the success that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had over the last year or so in our efforts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll open up to a few questions for him, and then he\xe2\x80\x99ll go.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to our regularly scheduled programming.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, Adam, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, Josh.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure to be here.\xc2\xa0 And good afternoon to you all.\xc2\xa0 As you all know, our strategy to counter ISIL has been a whole-of-government approach, including military, diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement, as well as financial efforts to address all aspects of this very dangerous threat.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne critical piece has been our work to cut off ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing.\xc2\xa0 That is going to be a focus, as Josh noted, of the U.N. Security Council meeting tomorrow, a historic meeting, where Secretary Lew will chair a meeting of finance ministers at the U.N.\xc2\xa0 I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s the first time in the history of the Security Council that finance ministers have sat in the chairs around the table.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe goal of the meeting is to bolster our international efforts to get at ISIL sources of revenue, to isolate them from the international financial system, and to counter-financing of terrorism more broadly, even beyond ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So, first, I want to speak briefly about the work that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing to target ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing both within the U.S. government and with our international partners, and then I want to turn to the resolution that we expect to be introduced tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn our ISIL efforts, of course ISIL presents an extremely challenging financial target because of its ability to extract revenues from the territory that it controls.\xc2\xa0 But ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s need to control territory is also a vulnerability.\xc2\xa0 ISIL requires large and steady streams of income to pay salaries, procure weapons, maintain infrastructure and a semblance of government.\xc2\xa0 And ISIL needs access to the international financial system.\xc2\xa0 They are not entirely self-reliant.\xc2\xa0 They need to be able to move money, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s with respect to importing oil infrastructure, oil pieces; whether it\xe2\x80\x99s with respect to procuring weapons or communications equipment, or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s with respect to moving money to their off-shore affiliates.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve targeted both ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s ability to generate funds and its ability to use and transfer funds through the international financial system.\xc2\xa0 On the revenue side, the most important pieces, of course, are military -- working with coalition partners to target the entire oil supply chain, from the oil fields and wellheads, to the refineries and processing plants, to the tanker trucks themselves.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen the impact that that\xe2\x80\x99s been having over recent weeks.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond, in terms of accessing the international financial system, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been targeting, using our sanctions tool, to get at ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s key financial facilitators and their leaders and companies.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve designated more than 30 of their senior leaders and financiers this year alone.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working through international forums, like the Counter-ISIL Finance Group, which is co-chaired by Saudi Arabia, Italy and the United States.\xc2\xa0 It includes more than 30 jurisdictions worldwide, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a platform for us to be sharing information, both targeted and more systemic, about ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s revenue streams and flows, and then work together to collaborate to cut them off.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re working, of course, very intensively with our regional partners.\xc2\xa0 In Iraq, we saw the central government cut off over 90 bank branches that were in ISIL-controlled territory from the Central Bank, and therefore from access to any international financial platform.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve also worked with the governments in Jordan, the governments in Turkey to intensify the scrutiny and the oversight of less formal financial channels, like money service businesses and exchange houses, which we believe ISIL is using to smuggle cash to and then place them in order to move the funds.\xc2\xa0 All of this work will only intensify in the coming months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me now turn to the upcoming U.N. Security Council meeting that, as I said, will take place in New York tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 We expect that the Security Council will be adopting a new resolution to focus its longstanding al Qaeda sanctions regime equally on the threat posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 As a word of background, the al Qaeda sanctions regime has been the principal U.N. sanctions tool to direct asset freezes against terror groups.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing is elevating ISIL, putting it on that same level, and turning those tools and that same experience that we\xe2\x80\x99ve built up internationally against ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe resolution will add a designation prong, making it a sanctionable offense as it were to associate with ISIL, and giving us more flexibility to go after those who are helping ISIL, whether to move funds, to store funds, or to earn funds.\xc2\xa0 The resolution will also include a number of new broader measures to strengthen our international efforts against terror groups across the board.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be calling on all countries to fully criminalize the financing of terrorism and terrorist fighters for any purpose, even in the absence of a link to a specific terrorist act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd further, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be calling on countries to expand and intensify information-sharing, both across governments, within governments, and with the private sector.\xc2\xa0 That last piece may sound mundane, but I can tell you, having worked in the counterterrorist financing arena basically since 2002, that\xe2\x80\x99s where the rubber meets the road.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about when banks see a suspicious transaction, are they flagging that for financial authorities.\xc2\xa0 And if they are, and that system is working well, is that information then accessible to law enforcement, and can it married with travel data, can it be married with intelligence data so that we can have the best possible chance of disrupting the next attack.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur experience in combatting terrorist financing over the last 15 years has shown that we can successfully pressure these groups, that we can make an impact, and really put fierce pressure on them with respect to sustaining their operations, especially with a group like ISIL that is so dependence on renewable revenue streams.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will be continuing to do this work -- as I said, intensifying in the weeks to come.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to be adaptive.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to be nimble.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to be persistent.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a few questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mike, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Can you sort of give us a sense of how the strength of this compares with the financial sanctions against the Iran regime, which really were effective?\xc2\xa0 And what specific real impact will this U.N. resolution have on financial institutions?\xc2\xa0 What will be different for financial institutions after this passes, specifically, than before?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 So, on the first, I would say we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about apples and oranges in some respects.\xc2\xa0 With respect to Iran, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a large developed government that had major, in the numbers of billions, in imports and exports whose oil revenues were being derived from overseas sales and were going through conventional means, like large tanker deliveries to other developed countries.\xc2\xa0 Their banking system was a developed banking system that had access to other banks through the normal financial platforms.\xc2\xa0 All of those things that would distinguish a government from a terror group are things that distinguished, I would say, our sanctions approach.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, our sanctions approach is going to be tailored.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What unifies the two is we see a tremendous international agreement and tremendous international focus with respect to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 It was a key ingredient in getting us the pressure we needed with respect to Iran.\xc2\xa0 And we see that same consensus when it comes to pressuring ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I should mention -- I neglected to mention earlier, we\'re going to be co-sponsoring tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s resolution with the Russians, jointly bringing that to the Security Council.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a reflection of the unity of purpose that we see here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other thing that I would say that we have working in our favor with respect to ISIL is we have all those same tools.\xc2\xa0 So when you talk about the financial measures that we use, whether they\'re about freezing assets, whether about increasing due diligence at banks, whether about closing access to the international financial system, obviously we\'re going to be drawing on each and every one of those tools in the ISIL context.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To turn to your second question, with respect to what will this mean for banks, I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to change what Western banks are doing right now, or, frankly, banks around the world.\xc2\xa0 We do not see that financial institutions are receptive to ISIL money flows.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about finding those flows, and that\'s where we need to be collaborating.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to have, as governments, better intelligence, better information than a bank would.\xc2\xa0 But banks are also going to be picking up on suspicious cash movements that we might not see.\xc2\xa0 So it needs to be a very active two-way conversation.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you, if you\'re interested, to a number of advisories that FinCEN -- it\xe2\x80\x99s our anti-money-laundering bureau within Treasury -- has put out to say to banks in the U.S. and around the world, here\xe2\x80\x99s some red flags to look for as you\'re trying to track ISIL financing, whether with respect to the periodicity of flows or whether with respect to some more pretty obvious geographic things, like a customer makes ATM withdrawals at a branch on the border of Turkey, on the border of ISIL-controlled territory.\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s something that you should be raising a red flag about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that, how big an impact do you think this can have on cutting off funds?\xc2\xa0 Do you think you could cut off 100 percent of their financing, 50 percent, 25 percent?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 You\'re talking about ISIL in particular?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ISIL in particular.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 So we never said -- I mean, obviously, it would be wonderful if they had zero percent of their financing.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the way we structure our goals.\xc2\xa0 The object is to put substantial and ultimately severe financial pressure on the organization such that they\'re encumbered, they\'re constrained.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not able to pay salaries.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not able to pay benefits.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not able to provide the governance that is so central to their narrative.\xc2\xa0 In all of those ways, you put ISIL back on their heels, and it can change the dynamic.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re trying to do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Gardiner.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You want to criminalize the financing of ISIL and of terror generally.\xc2\xa0 We did a series this past year about how the Europeans are routinely paying for their citizens to be released from kidnapping, and that kidnapping is a huge source of financing for ISIL and other terror groups.\xc2\xa0 Tell me how you\'re going to get this passed through Europeans if they continue to fund terrorism as they are doing and continue to do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 So your question I think is bringing together a couple of disparate elements.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, when we\'re talking about criminalizing terrorist financing, the focus is on those who are intentionally, willfully providing financing to terror groups.\xc2\xa0 And what we have in mind by and large is not those who are the victims or the families of victims of kidnapping attempts.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to KFR, as we call it, kidnapping for ransom, we actually don\'t see that as a primary or even secondary source of revenue for ISIL.\xc2\xa0 They have used it.\xc2\xa0 They have obtained millions of dollars in ransom.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re talking about a group where they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to access hundreds of millions of dollars through things like extortion or taxation, and through things like oil and gas sales.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So our efforts have to be focused on the largest revenue streams, and that\'s where we\'re pointed right now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to the Russians, they made an allegation a couple of weeks ago that Turkey was buying black market oil from ISIS.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?\xc2\xa0 And who is buying this ISIS oil?\xc2\xa0 Do you have states I mind?\xc2\xa0 Do you have big names in mind in terms of who is responsible for this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t see any evidence that the Turkish government is purchasing oil from ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The preponderance of their sales, we believe, are happening at the wellhead in a sense.\xc2\xa0 In other words, they\'re selling to middlemen or black marketeers, who are then in turn providing it to others.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of external purchasers, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the Syrian government as a purchaser -- especially when it comes to gas.\xc2\xa0 But I think in terms of the overall destination, a lot of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s oil is going within the territory that they control -- whether with respect to fueling their own efforts and their own military campaigns, or whether with respect to providing electricity to the territories they\'re trying to govern.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ron.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us more detail about the dimensions of the ISIS economy?\xc2\xa0 You said hundreds of millions of dollars I think.\xc2\xa0 The primary revenue streams you said are extortion, oil.\xc2\xa0 Is that, in fact, the order?\xc2\xa0 Is most of it -- are most of their dealings in nontraditional financial venues as opposed to more traditional venues, or vice versa?\xc2\xa0 And is there any evidence that what\xe2\x80\x99s been done so far to decrease this, to shrink this economy, has been effective?\xc2\xa0 Is there any data that points to it being smaller now than it was six months or a year ago, or whatever?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 So, thank you.\xc2\xa0 A lot of key questions that we spend a lot of time focusing on, as you\xe2\x80\x99d imagine.\xc2\xa0 ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s inflows in terms of revenues are large in Syria, and it\'s why this is such a serious challenge.\xc2\xa0 The other aspect to them that distinguishes them from a group like al Qaeda, for example, is that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been internally generated.\xc2\xa0 So if you picture al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s revenue streams, they\xe2\x80\x99re typically coming in from outside donors, from charities that they can abuse or corrupt, or from kidnapping for ransom -- things where the funds need to be transferred to them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With ISIL, it\'s funds from within.\xc2\xa0 And you\'re right to summarize it, taxation/extortion -- whether that\'s with respect to things that we might look at as property taxes if this was a normal state -- income, financial fees on financial transmissions, and then the oil and gas sales.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In both cases, we\'re talking about the potential to generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the bad news, and that\'s the magnitude of the threat we face.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe good news is ISIL has a number of vulnerabilities as well.\xc2\xa0 They have massive needs.\xc2\xa0 They are fighting a multi-front war at the same time that they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to provide governance, provide assistance to overseas affiliates, and trying to build this reputation of a supposed Islamic caliphate.\xc2\xa0 None of that is cheap.\xc2\xa0 And so they not only need the funds that they can get today, they need those to be renewed tomorrow and the day after and the day after.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so our strategy is to put a major dent into that and to, as I said, put them back on their heels, make them make some very hard tradeoffs.\xc2\xa0 And you will see when foreign fighters can\'t be paid, when groups aren\'t getting and people who are used to being paid are not being paid their normal salaries or are being told to wait several weeks, that has an impact.\xc2\xa0 It has an impact on the battlefield, it has an impact on morale, and it has an impact on what the group can do.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne sub-question that you asked I think had to do with are they using the formal financial system.\xc2\xa0 By and large, no.\xc2\xa0 By and large, they\xe2\x80\x99re using things like hawalas within their territory and bulk cash couriers to move funds.\xc2\xa0 But they do need -- and this is a vulnerability for them -- they do need access to the international financial system.\xc2\xa0 There are things that ISIL needs they can\'t get from within.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo whether it\'s replacing oil equipment or oil infrastructure, whether it\'s with respect to certain weapons or communications equipment, if they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to import something they\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to move funds.\xc2\xa0 And when they do that, they\xe2\x80\x99re, one, ideally leaving a money trail that we can follow up on; and two, giving us a vulnerability, something we can disrupt.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any evidence that you have been able to do this?\xc2\xa0 Have you seen the numbers fall?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\'ve heard the administration say that the caliphate is shrinking, or the territory is shrinking.\xc2\xa0 Is the economy shrinking now, too?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 So we believe that the coalition\xe2\x80\x99s campaign -- because your question is going to the influx of funds -- the coalition\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, this operation, Tidal Wave II, is making a real difference and making a real impact.\xc2\xa0 It\'s too soon for me to be able to talk to you about numbers, and what are the percentages, what are the dollar blows.\xc2\xa0 But I think we\'re focused on exactly the right targets, exactly the right vulnerabilities in terms of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make money.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about the Russians.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could tell us about the challenges or the opportunities in dealing with the Russians in terms of sanctions, in trying to fight ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 As I noted, I think it\'s significant -- we\'re going to be co-sponsoring this resolution tomorrow, along with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 There is a unity of purpose when it comes to terrorism, globally.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ve been in this arena for 15 years.\xc2\xa0 There are innumerable instances where we\'ve worked really closely with the Russians -- whether it\'s with respect to raising international standards, keeping money laundering, keeping terrorist financing out of the international financial system.\xc2\xa0 And it extends, I believe, to efforts to cut off ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s revenues, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on that, the resolution.\xc2\xa0 Is it specific just to ISIS, or is it al Qaeda and all associated affiliates?\xc2\xa0 Like, would this also apply to al Nusra and some of the other groups?\xc2\xa0 Is everyone on board with that?\xc2\xa0 How much of this intelligence came from specifically the Abu Sayyaf raid?\xc2\xa0 If you can give us some attribution on how you know what you say you know.\xc2\xa0 And any kind of external flows.\xc2\xa0 Because most of what you\xe2\x80\x99re describing is how you fund the caliphate.\xc2\xa0 Are you seeing money being moved to fund external terror operations in Libya or elsewhere?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try to remember all three parts of that, and am now recognizing for the thousandth time why you have a very hard job.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ll help me.\xc2\xa0 So the first question was --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the resolution.\xc2\xa0 Is this just ISIS or is it --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 The resolution.\xc2\xa0 So it not ISIS.\xc2\xa0 In fact, what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is importing ISIL into what has been the al Qaeda sanctions regime.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a sanctions regime that dates back to 2002, I believe, the aftermath of 9/11.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s been sort of the crown jewel in terms of U.N. Security Council-targeted sanctions.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been the most developed.\xc2\xa0 It has a monitoring team that most people don\xe2\x80\x99t know about.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a U.N. monitoring team that reports to the al Qaeda committee that goes around and surveys countries -- how well are they implementing their obligations -- which is critical.\xc2\xa0 I had an earlier question, I think, about implementation -- what are you going to do to make sure countries are actually adhering to their commitments under this resolution.\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, there is a lot of bilateral jawboning, but also the U.N. monitoring team has been incredibly valuable.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be doing is importing ISIL into that framework, and ensuring that we have the same authorities, the same focus, the same follow-up on ISIL that we do on al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 Nusra, al Qaeda, would all already be covered under the existing regimes.</p>\n<p>\n\tYour second question was I think on the Abu Sayyaf raid?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yeah.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 So the Abu Sayyaf raid was very significant.\xc2\xa0 I know Josh and others have talked about how it advanced our knowledge.\xc2\xa0 But particularly as somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s focused on the financing side, this was an individual who was intimately involved with and familiar with how ISIL was earning and how it was expending its revenue.\xc2\xa0 So I will acknowledge that\xe2\x80\x99s a big advance in terms of what we know and in terms of being able to put scope and some rough dollar figures on some of these flows.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any rough dollar figures on the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 So, our estimates, if you go back, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, six or eight weeks, were about $400 million in terms of oil and gas revenues a year.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a huge amount of money.\xc2\xa0 Again, I want to remind people about the huge amounts of expenditures the group needs.\xc2\xa0 What, of course, we all are focused on now is what impact is the coalition recent strikes -- are the coalition recent strikes having.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a stepped up pace in terms of the number of strikes, but also better intelligence guiding us to more effective, more impactful targets.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something where I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to come back to you in the coming weeks about the impact and what the revenue streams look like now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the last question was about transferring money out of the Islamic State to fund terror operations.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 So I successfully remembered zero of your three questions.\xc2\xa0 I want that noted.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 In terms of transferring money outside of the Islamic State, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s where I think the Treasury expertise and the Treasury tools are particularly useful.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re not in the kinetic strike business.\xc2\xa0 You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want me anywhere near that.\xc2\xa0 But ISIL does need access to the international financial system.\xc2\xa0 It likes to present itself to the world as being self-reliant -- and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And as they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to move money, including to affiliates, as you noted, those are potential vulnerabilities for us, to be able to track funds and to be able to disrupt the funds.</p>\n<p>\n\tI also want to note that the whole discussion so far has been focusing sort of at what I sometimes called the macro level -- how is the organization funding itself; how are they directing money abroad; what are the levels of funding that they need to sustain themselves.\xc2\xa0 But when we work on counter-financing terrorism, there\xe2\x80\x99s also a micro, more operational level, which is are we harnessing the data.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s very rich data when it comes to financial transfers in the most effective way we can to equip the FBI and their equivalents all across the world to be able to detect terror threats, to be able to hopefully stop the next terror attack.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason I note that is because when two terrorists talk to themselves on cell phones, they\xe2\x80\x99ll use code, they probably won\xe2\x80\x99t use each other\xe2\x80\x99s real names, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make lots of efforts to mask what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re sending money to somebody, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to use their real name, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to use identifiers -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s an address, a telephone number.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s the sense in which I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s very rich data, and it\xe2\x80\x99s there for us.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd nearly every jurisdiction around the world has a regime that calls for banks to be submitting suspicious activity reports a financial intelligence unit.\xc2\xa0 What it comes down to is often communication -- making sure that their treasury department is talking to their FBI, their CIA, their DHS.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the focuses that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see in tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s resolution.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jessica, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wonder, you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a big push right now by the administration about the Turkish border, specifically.\xc2\xa0 Would Turkey be any more pushed or eligible for sanctions if it was found to be the case that, over that border, some of these transactions were taking place?\xc2\xa0 Would these sanctions have an extra bite on Turkey specifically in that scenario?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SZUBIN:\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything in the resolution that would be penalizing governments, per se.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about targeting sanctions against the companies, the facilitators, the fundraisers who we see working with and on behalf of these terror groups, ISIL in particular here.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can certainly agree with and underscore your point about the importance of securing that border.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important for the work that I do in terms of cash smuggling and getting funds into and out of ISIL territory.\xc2\xa0 And of course it\xe2\x80\x99s important with respect to foreign terrorist fighter flow, with respect to weapons -- all of the above.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Adam.\xc2\xa0 All right, with that, we can go straight to your questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kevin, do you want to get started?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll get started on the U.S. budget and what Congress approved -- or what Congress has posted.\xc2\xa0 And I wanted to get your overall impressions on the budget, and what are the significant accomplishments as far as the administration is concerned, as well as what are going to be some of the bitter pills that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to swallow in this budget.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good.\xc2\xa0 I was hoping that was where we would start.\xc2\xa0 And in thinking about how I wanted to describe to you the success that we feel like we had in the context of the budget negotiations, I thought I would actually rely on a lot of the good reporting that\xe2\x80\x99s been done in this room about the budget negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For example, over the last couple of weeks I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked on two different occasions if the administration would accept any riders on Dodd-Frank in the omnibus budget bill.\xc2\xa0 We did not.\xc2\xa0 No riders on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the last couple of weeks I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked twice if we would accept a rider delaying the fiduciary rule, which obviously protects retirement investments for middle-class families all across the country.\xc2\xa0 We did not.\xc2\xa0 No impact on the fiduciary rule from the omnibus.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a period of time where I was asked frequently about whether or not the administration would tolerate any riders relating to allowing Syrian refugees to enter the United States.\xc2\xa0 We did not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was asked on at least one occasion last month if the administration would accept a rider cutting funding for our efforts to fight climate change.\xc2\xa0 We didn\'t.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was asked -- Cheryl, you asked at least one time, I think maybe even twice -- if we would accept a rider blocking the NLRB from enforcing the joint employer liability rule, which provides critical workplace protection to franchise employees.\xc2\xa0 We did not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was asked on a couple of occasions, including Mr. Dorning, about whether or not we would accept a rider repealing the medical device tax.\xc2\xa0 We did not.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was asked on a number of occasions whether or not the administration would accept the rider repealing the \xe2\x80\x9cCadillac tax.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We did not.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a period in time earlier this fall in which I was asked frequently about whether or not the administration would accept any riders related to funding for Planned Parenthood.\xc2\xa0 We did not.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was asked -- I don\'t see John Gizzi here, but he had asked about a specific rider relating to the IRS and an audit of Planned Parenthood.\xc2\xa0 We did not accept that rider either.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we walked into these negotiations focused on making sure that Republicans would not succeed in advancing their ideological agenda through the budgetary process.\xc2\xa0 And I think based on all of the solid reporting work that you have done over the last several weeks, there were a variety of attempts that Republicans undertook to try to do exactly that.\xc2\xa0 And we did succeed in fighting off those efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is also true about this budget agreement -- and this goes to one of the central priorities of the administration over the course of this year -- is that it provides substantial funding for both our economic and national security priorities over and above the sequester.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we feel good about the outcome primarily because we got a compromise budget agreement that fought off a wide variety of ideological riders, but yet ensures the priorities that this administration has identified when it comes to investing in middle-class families and protecting the country.\xc2\xa0 And we succeeded.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you feel you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to give up?\xc2\xa0 I know you also talked a lot about opposing removing the restrictions on crude oil exports.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good example, and that is something that we did not support.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, we still don\'t support it.\xc2\xa0 And our objection has primarily been, as I noted on a couple of occasions as recently as yesterday, along procedural grounds.\xc2\xa0 This is authority that was already vested with the administration, and we believe that legislation in this regard was unnecessary.\xc2\xa0 But I would draw a distinction between an objection that we have on procedural grounds from some of the more ideologically motivated provisions that I listed off at the top.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me say a couple of other things about this.\xc2\xa0 One reason that we\'re not overly concerned with the substance of the lifting of the oil export ban is that the United States already exports 4.3 million barrels a day of refined petroleum product.\xc2\xa0 And there were already written into the law a handful of waivers to the crude oil export ban that allowed companies in the United States to export 500,000 barrels of oil -- of crude oil each day under those exceptions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the fact is, yes, this is a legislative action that would require the lifting of this ban.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is there was already substantial petroleum products, both refined and unrefined, that were already being exported.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I would also note that is included in the budget, on the positive side of the ledger, is the biggest investment in the deployment of renewable energy in American history.\xc2\xa0 For a long time, the administration had to engage in negotiations with Congress on a yearly basis about the extension, for example, of the production tax credit -- a tax credit that provides powerful incentives to the wind industry.\xc2\xa0 And these were tax credits that essentially were negotiated at the very end of the year so that they were almost completely retroactive.\xc2\xa0 This created a lot of uncertainty about the financial policies that would be in place for wind energy companies that are trying to make longer-term decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s critically important that we succeeded in securing essentially a five-year commitment to the production tax credit.\xc2\xa0 We also succeeded in securing a five-year tax credit for the solar industry.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is significant because we would be building on substantial momentum that has already been built up.\xc2\xa0 Since the President was elected to office we have tripled the amount of energy that is produced in this country by the wind.\xc2\xa0 And we have increased by thirtyfold the amount of energy that is produced in this country by solar.\xc2\xa0 The United States is now the largest producer in the world of energy by wind.\xc2\xa0 And if you take a look at job creation, the solar industry is creating jobs at a rate of 10 times the rest of the economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last thing I will say about this is there also was an effort on the part of Republicans to try to limit the implementation of a wide variety of clean energy policies that this administration has long championed.\xc2\xa0 This got less attention than some of the riders that I mentioned in response to your first question.\xc2\xa0 But there were tangible efforts on the part of Republicans to limit our ability to implement the Clean Power Plan, to implement the Clean Water Act, to revise ozone standards, to include the social cost of carbon when calculating a variety of environmental rules, to limit the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to implement the Antiquities Act, and to limit the ability of the administration to enforce the Endangered Species Act.\xc2\xa0 The efforts by Republicans to undermine the implementation of those rules was also rebuffed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when you take a look at the entire package, I think the country can feel good about how this budget reflects the priorities that the President has laid out when it comes to transitioning to the low-carbon economy of the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last one.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to make any stops on the way to Hawaii, particularly to visit with people in San Bernardino, California?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, as we mentioned, the President is planning to depart the White House on Friday to travel to Hawaii with his family as he has traditionally done over the holidays.\xc2\xa0 But while he is en route to Honolulu, the President will stop in San Bernardino, California to visit privately with the families of the victims of the terror attack in San Bernardino that occurred earlier this month.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For those of you who covered the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Oregon earlier this fall, this visit will be patterned after that, which is that the President will meet with each of these families in private.\xc2\xa0 And I do not anticipate at this point that there will be any media access to those encounters.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Roberta.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 House Democratic Leader Pelosi has said that she\xe2\x80\x99s concerned that the bill has massive giveaways to special interests and big corporations.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just wondering whether the White House shares that concern at all.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, speaking generally, Roberta, we\'ve acknowledged all along that the successful completion of budget negotiations would require Democrats and Republicans to compromise.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the fact that Republican priorities, particularly in the context of these budget agreements, have centered on giveaways to big corporations and to some of their largest donors.\xc2\xa0 And if the President were writing this budget -- in fact, he did write a budget -- but in our ideal budget, those kinds of giveaways would not be included.\xc2\xa0 But this is a compromise proposal, and based on the priorities that we have set out to accomplish, the President is pleased with the final product even if it does reflect the kind of compromise that\'s necessary when you have a Democratic President negotiating with large majorities of Republicans in both the House and Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there are no measures included in the package that would be so objectionable to the President that he would veto this bill?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are a number of measures that are included in the proposal that we do not support.\xc2\xa0 But taken together, when you consider the overall package and the degree to which this proposal lives up to our values in terms of making sure that we are investing in middle-class families and taking the steps that are necessary to protect the country, the President will be pleased to sign the bill.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, the Fed seems set to raise rates today.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel the economy is ready for this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the more pertinent question is whether or not the board of the Federal Reserve feels that it is appropriate to make that decision.\xc2\xa0 When they feel that it is, then that\'s a decision that they will announce.\xc2\xa0 And given our longstanding respect for the independence of that agency, we\'ll decline to provide any color commentary about decisions that they may or may not be intending to make.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, at the debate last night, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie described the President as a \xe2\x80\x9cfeckless weakling,\xe2\x80\x9d and said that he would advocate the establishment of a no-fly zone over portions of Syria and that, if necessary, he would advocate shooting down Russian planes to enforce that no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 Donald Trump talked about infiltrating the Internet to try to stop ISIS.\xc2\xa0 And Ted Cruz talked about making sand glow by pummeling ISIS or trying to bomb them into oblivion, I think he might have said.\xc2\xa0 What is your response to all of that, some of the rhetoric that we heard in last night\xe2\x80\x99s debate?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that, in the context of the debate, that we heard a lot of bluster but not a lot of good ideas that are going to keep the country safe.\xc2\xa0 And, look, in the context of a presidential election, you would anticipate that there would be a robust and vigorous debate about our priorities even when it comes to our foreign policy and our national security.\xc2\xa0 That is a debate that should occur in the context of a presidential election, and we obviously welcome that debate because there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty stark difference between the bluster-filled approach of Republican candidates for president and the kind of smart, tough diplomacy and leadership that the President has shown consistently on the international stage over the last seven years.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Marco Rubio, Senator Rubio said at one point in an exchange with Senator Cruz that doing away with bulk phone collection over at the NSA may have national security implications.\xc2\xa0 And he said that if there\xe2\x80\x99s a terrorist attack and people want to find out why it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped, the answer better not be, well, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have access to those phone records.\xc2\xa0 I know you can\'t go through everything that was said last night, but what is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view of that characterization that this somehow makes the American people less secure?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, that runs directly counter to the advice that our national security experts in the intelligence community have offered about the true impact of that piece of legislation. It isn\'t just valuable that that legislation put in place better protections for civil liberties of law-abiding Americans, it actually gave the intelligence community more access to more information that they can use to keep the country safe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, you don\'t have to take my word for it.\xc2\xa0 That is exactly what the intelligence community experts themselves told Congress when they were debating this legislation.\xc2\xa0 So the freshman senator from Florida is certainly entitled to his own opinion.\xc2\xa0 But I think most people who are interested in national security are going to put quite a bit more stock in the judgment of the apolitical but dedicated professionals at the leading intelligence agencies of the United States.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And yesterday, during Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s visit with Vladimir Putin -- or I guess afterwards -- there was a press conference, and during the press conference, Secretary Kerry said that our goal is not regime change in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Is that comment in line with the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view on Bashar al-Assad and his future in Syria?\xc2\xa0 Because for the longest time it seems as though you\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying Assad must go, the President said Assad must go.\xc2\xa0 It seems what Secretary Kerry was saying was maybe moving back from that position a little bit.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t think -- our position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed and I don\'t think that\'s what Secretary Kerry was trying to convey.\xc2\xa0 I think Secretary Kerry, even in the context of his opening remarks at the avail, made clear that Bashar al-Assad has lost legitimacy to lead that country.\xc2\xa0 And it is precisely because of his failed leadership and his inability to keep that country together that we\'re seeing so much violence and chaos inside of Syria that did create an opening for ISIL and has negatively impacted the lives of millions of Syrians who have been forced to flee their homes and their communities to escape that violence.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All of that can be traced back directly to the failed leadership of Bashar al-Assad.\xc2\xa0 And Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s response to all of that has been to use the weaponry of the Syrian military to attack his own people.\xc2\xa0 So it is not just our vigorous moral objection to his leadership that has caused us to conclude that it\'s time for him to go; it is just a practical matter that you\'re not going to be able to lead a country successfully if you\xe2\x80\x99ve spent most of the last five years attacking those people, violently, with barrel bombs and other heinous weapons that have caused widespread death and destruction, including the loss of life of innocent women and children.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said before that there is increasing support for common-sense gun safety measures, but for the first time in more than 20 years, most Americans oppose an assault weapons ban.\xc2\xa0 Do you still believe that the momentum is on your side?\xc2\xa0 Are these numbers a sign that the President\xe2\x80\x99s message isn\'t getting through?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mary, I\'ve been frequently citing the data from this New Hampshire poll of Republicans that indicates there continues to be strong support for -- even surprisingly strong support for closing the no-fly, no-buy loophole.\xc2\xa0 Right now, there is no law on the books that prevents somebody who is suspected by the U.S. government of being a terrorist from being able to walk into a gun store and buy a gun.\xc2\xa0 Eighty-five percent of New Hampshire Republicans, about half of whom have a gun in their household, support closing that loophole.\xc2\xa0 That is a common-sense measure, and yet we\'ve seen significant resistance from Republicans to passing that kind of bill.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We saw something similar when it comes to closing the background check loophole.\xc2\xa0 According to that poll, about 75 percent of New Hampshire Republicans support closing that loophole.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we continue to believe that we will see congressional action once the intensity of the argument on the side of those who support gun safety measures has been made clear to members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And the only way that will happen is if people who support those common-sense measures stand up and speak out and make clear to their elected representatives that the way that members of Congress handle these issues is going to have a direct impact on the decisions made by voters at the ballot box.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it seems like we\'re seeing some shift after some of these recent events.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel that some of these recent events are fueling in some ways the position of gun rights advocates?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think it\'s hard to tell.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of data that I can marshal on our side of the argument to indicate that there\xe2\x80\x99s some movement in the direction that we support.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like there\xe2\x80\x99s probably some data on the other side.\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly worthy of a discussion. But the only way that we\'re going to see the kind of change that we need to see is not just in the movement of poll numbers, but in the intensity of the response of those who advocate common-sense gun safety measures when they\xe2\x80\x99re communicating with their members of Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Back to the tax extenders part of the package, Democratic Leader Pelosi had a lot of concerns about extending some of these permanently.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House comfortable making some of these tax credits permanent?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Cheryl, this is another example of an element of this proposal that reflects a bipartisan compromise.\xc2\xa0 That means that the administration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support every element of the agreement, but there are a lot of reasons for the President to feel good about what was accomplished in those negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me walk you through a couple of them.\xc2\xa0 The first is there are a variety of Recovery Act tax credits that are focused on working families that are made permanent in the context of these discussions.\xc2\xa0 So, again, these are things like the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, the expansion of the Child Tax Credit, and the creation of the American Opportunity Tax Credit.\xc2\xa0 The expansion of those first two tax credits and the American Opportunity Tax Credit benefit about 24 million working families a year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So many of you covered the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign in 2007 and 2008, and he vowed to come to Washington, D.C. to cut taxes for middle-class families and make sure that when Congress is handing out tax benefits they\xe2\x80\x99re not just giving it out to the large corporations that can afford to hire well-connected lobbyists.\xc2\xa0 And this is an excellent example of the President making good on that promise.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know many of you are considering the President\xe2\x80\x99s legacy and considering different elements of the President\xe2\x80\x99s legacy.\xc2\xa0 Making permanent tax credits that are focused on middle-class families and that have an average benefit on the order of about $900 a year for working people I think is a great example of how the President brought change to Washington, D.C. in a way that will be felt by 24 million families -- working families -- all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are other elements of the proposal that we do support, other things that the President himself proposed.\xc2\xa0 For example, this would also make permanent a provision in the tax code that would allow small businesses to essentially zero out their capital gains.\xc2\xa0 This was actually a policy proposal that sounds like something that Republicans might support -- they do.\xc2\xa0 This is actually a policy that Senator Obama discussed in his 2008 Democratic nominating convention speech in Denver.\xc2\xa0 This is a hallmark of the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that tax benefits shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just go to the wealthy and well-connected corporations; we need to be looking out for small businesses, too.\xc2\xa0 And this is a good example of that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This would also make permanent a series of other investment incentives for small businesses.\xc2\xa0 This package also includes making permanent the research and experimentation tax credit -- the R&amp;E tax credit.\xc2\xa0 The President has long believed that innovation in our economy will stimulate economic growth and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 This is a tangible way that the government can be supportive of that kind of research and experimentation and innovation, and that\'s going to be good for our economy over all.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there isn\'t just a lot to like in here for Democrats.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot in here that illustrates the significant change that Barack Obama brought to Washington, D.C. when it comes to making sure somebody somewhere is looking out for middle-class families when it comes to a discussion of our tax code.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jessica.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On arms sales to Taiwan, a couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 First of all, why did it take the administration four years to notify Congress of the next sale -- a little bit under four years?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jessica, I don\'t have a lot of insight for you in terms of the pace of these decisions, but I certainly can confirm for you that the administration has notified Congress of a $1.83 billion defense arms sales package to Taiwan.\xc2\xa0 This notification follows previous notifications by the Obama administration that totals about $12 billion in assistance.\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s notification is consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act and U.S. support for Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s ability to maintain sufficient self-defense capability.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would hasten to add that there has been no change to our longstanding One-China policy that\'s based on the three joint communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act.\xc2\xa0 This is a policy that has been pursued by a handful of Presidents, both Democrat and Republican, including President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor.\xc2\xa0 And what we\'ve seen is that across decades and across that series of presidential administrations, the United States has demonstrated its firm commitment to making available to Taiwan items necessary for Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow, the President of this country and the President of China have been on the phone quite a bit in light of the climate announcement -- I think four phone calls, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve read out one of them.\xc2\xa0 Was this brought up in those calls?\xc2\xa0 Can you talk -- if you can\'t talk specifically to that, can you talk about how, if at all, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to prepare China for this inevitability?\xc2\xa0 The last time this happened they severed military-to-military relations for almost the entire year of 2010.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that a discussion of China\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Taiwan is something that has previously come up in presidential-level discussions.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, recently there was a high-ranking delegation of Chinese leaders that met with high-ranking Taiwanese officials, and obviously, the United States supports the warming of those relations and de-escalation of those tensions.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have a more detailed readout of the discussions to share with you beyond that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions on the omnibus.\xc2\xa0 First, the governor of Puerto Rico just said today that he expects them to default on their debts in January or May -- most likely the beginning of January.\xc2\xa0 How does the administration feel about having a U.S. territory default on its debt?\xc2\xa0 And do you all have any reason to believe that he\xe2\x80\x99s mistaken and something will come about to prevent this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen his specific comments.\xc2\xa0 So for more detailed response directly to his comments, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up with you.\xc2\xa0 I will say in general that the administration has long supported Congress taking action that would give Puerto Rico access to certain financial mechanisms that would allow them to deal with the difficult financial situation that they\'re facing.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken those steps yet.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been urging them to do so.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to advocate for Congress giving to Puerto Rico those kinds of options that they don\'t currently have.\xc2\xa0 It has been our consistent policy that we don\'t support a federal bailout of Puerto Rico, and that position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed either.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On the omnibus, as you noted, there was no repeal of the \xe2\x80\x9cCadillac tax\xe2\x80\x9d or of the medical devices tax.\xc2\xa0 However, there was a two-year delay I believe of both of them.\xc2\xa0 What impact do you all assess that will have on the Obamacare program and on the broader efforts to restrain the increase of health care expenditures contained in the Affordable Care Act?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we do know that Republicans laid out a goal essentially since the first day that the Affordable Care Act went into effect of repealing the law and they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken more than 50 votes over the course of the last several years actually trying to do exactly that.\xc2\xa0 They have failed in each of those 50 or so times that they\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to tear down the law.\xc2\xa0 So when you consider their ambitions, the steps that are included in this proposal are quite, quite meager.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe obviously believe -- and you\'ve heard me make the case before about the benefits associated with implementing the \xe2\x80\x9cCadillac tax.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Not only does that kind of tax offer up a clear incentive to lower health care costs, it also gives businesses an incentive to start investing in employees\xe2\x80\x99 wages.\xc2\xa0 And as there is a bipartisan discussion and debate about what can be done to boost wages in this country, this is one clear, tangible example that economists on both sides of the aisle agree would at least put some upward pressure on wages.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why we continue to be steadfast in our support for the \xe2\x80\x9cCadillac tax.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One thing that I would note is that in addition to the two-year suspension of the \xe2\x80\x9cCadillac tax\xe2\x80\x9d is that there are a couple of provisions that we believe over the long term will actually make the \xe2\x80\x9cCadillac tax\xe2\x80\x9d more effective in achieving our aims, so that when the \xe2\x80\x9cCadillac tax\xe2\x80\x9d is implemented, it will be more effective when that happens because of some of the changes that are included in this law.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- how significant the two-year delay is then?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would say that it is minimal.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And will the administration be able to repurpose funds for the Green Climate Fund under the omnibus?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, the text of the omnibus is, I believe, a couple thousand pages long, so it\xe2\x80\x99s still something that we\'re reviewing.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that based on what we have reviewed so far, there are no restrictions in our ability to make good on the President\xe2\x80\x99s promise to contribute to the Green Climate Fund.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, does the coal export-import rider prevent you from the cutoff of funding for foreign coal projects that the administration has promoted?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Again, this would fall in the same category.\xc2\xa0 Based on what we have been able to review about the bill so far, that language that\xe2\x80\x99s included in the omnibus would not require the administration to change our policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jared.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to follow up on Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question about Assad.\xc2\xa0 When I heard and read the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s comments out of Russia, it seemed to me a drastic change but also an evolution of the change that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- Assad must go; Assad won\xe2\x80\x99t have to go on day one of the transition; and now, Assad may not have to go.\xc2\xa0 But your answer to Jim seemed to say that this is not a drastic change.\xc2\xa0 Am I right in hearing that?\xc2\xa0 And should we not expect a completely different footing out of the meetings at the end of the week in New York?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You should not anticipate a change in our policy.\xc2\xa0 And, Jared, what we can do is I\xe2\x80\x99ll have somebody forward you the transcript of Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s remarks earlier today in Moscow -- because he was quite clear later in his remarks about the fact that a political transition inside of Syria is necessary.\xc2\xa0 He was clear about the fact that President Assad has lost legitimacy to lead that country.\xc2\xa0 And I think that should be a clear indication to you that our policy that Assad must go has not change.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the timing of it is crucial here, Josh.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- Assad\xe2\x80\x99s term ends in 2021.\xc2\xa0 Parliament elections in Syria are up in May.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States talking about changing the timelines for any of those, or are we allowing the Syrian people to determine Assad\xe2\x80\x99s future, which has been the Russian policy up till now?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it has been our policy all along that the Syrian people are the ones who should decide their future.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, it is the Syrian people who have the most at stake in the kind of political transition inside of Syria that we believe is long overdue.\xc2\xa0 In fact, that\'s why Secretary Kerry has been working so aggressively with the international community -- not just to organize the contours of a political transition, but also to organize the disparate variety of Syrian opposition groups into a coherent structure that can begin to enter into these conversations about the political transition.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Assad must go, but five, six years from now?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I certainly am not going to put a timeline on it.\xc2\xa0 But, yes, Assad --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 that\'s when his term is up.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this will be under extensive negotiation next in New York.\xc2\xa0 I will say that it is hard to imagine a scenario where the United States or, frankly, the rest of the international community or the Syrian people would allow the kind of chaos and violence that we see inside of Syria to persist for the next five or six years while President Assad finishes out his term.\xc2\xa0 It seems hard to imagine that any of the groups that I just mentioned would be at all inclined to support that kind of approach to the political transition that we believe is desperately needed in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the kind of supposition you would have made four years ago?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily.\xc2\xa0 I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kevin.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On the economy, a lot of people will be talking about it today, especially in light of the Fed rate hike. Because I don\'t want you to sort of have to deal with that, I want to ask you, broadly speaking, how are we doing?\xc2\xa0 How is the U.S. economy from the administration\xe2\x80\x99s perspective -- understanding that there is plenty of research out there that also seems to suggest that the middle class is, in fact, still shrinking although, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from you on a number of occasions, job growth has been consistent over the last 69 months.\xc2\xa0 So if you were to broad-brush it, how are we doing?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think, speaking generally as a layman, I think the broader trends of our economy are an indication that we have built up significant momentum in the context of our recovery from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a deep hole to dig out of.\xc2\xa0 But as you point out, we have made sustained and consistent progress -- both if you measure it based on job creation over the last 69 consecutive months -- if you take a look at economic growth, we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously made substantial progress in growing our economy at a rate of a little over 2 percent a year since 2010.\xc2\xa0 That is progress that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 We certainly would like to see the economy grow even faster.\xc2\xa0 And I think some of the things that are included in this budget agreement would actually support those efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know that a Republican insistence on trying to keep government spending at sequester levels has been and would be bad for our economy, and has been a restraint on economic growth.\xc2\xa0 So, in a balanced way, making critical investments in our economy and in our national security will be good for the overall economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the tax cuts that will be made permanent for working people that I described before -- the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, the expansion of the Child Tax Credit, the expansion of the American Opportunity Tax Credit that offers families a tax credit who are paying for college -- that\'s going to have a positive impact on our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll say, Kevin, some of the priorities that we\xe2\x80\x99ve identified for next year -- particularly congressional approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- as we look to our economic future are going to have a lot of positive benefits for the strength of our economy moving forward.\xc2\xa0 So these kinds of steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Congress, a willingness to compromise, I think will be good for our economy moving forward.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s more that Congress can do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned that the middle class is still shrinking?\xc2\xa0 You talked a lot about it, and yet statistically, it is still getting smaller.\xc2\xa0 It is still struggling for full employment, to say nothing of the fact that overall employment is down at the lowest participation rate in decades.\xc2\xa0 How much of that falls on the President?\xc2\xa0 Or is that primarily Congress\xe2\x80\x99s fault?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let us follow up with you on a participation rate question.\xc2\xa0 But what I will say is that the President has been focused since his first days in office on putting in place government policies that are in the best interests of working families.\xc2\xa0 And there is no denying that in the economic downturn that our country sustained back in 2007 and 2008 and 2009, that middle-class families and those families that are trying to get into the middle class were hit the hardest and they\xe2\x80\x99ve had the deepest hole to dig out of.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But because of their tenacity and their skill and their work ethic, our country has made substantial progress.\xc2\xa0 And what the President is hoping now is that we can seize the momentum that we now have built up from the worst -- from our economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the policies that I\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed that are included in the budget bill are important.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly why we have some ideas for additional things that Congress can do next year to further strengthen the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick follow on Assad.\xc2\xa0 Previously, people have made the criticism that in the absence of a Qaddafi or of a Hussein -- a number of places in that region when you sort of take out one admittedly bad guy, if you want to call him that -- you leave a power vacuum, or you might even make things worse.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position the Assad should go, that the people in Syria should make the decision.\xc2\xa0 But what then, is my question.\xc2\xa0 How do you keep it from ending up essentially like what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in other places?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is exactly the question that Secretary Kerry is working to answer by convening this meeting in New York later this week, where essentially the international community will come together to sketch the outlines of what a political transition inside of Syria looks like.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this has been no small undertaking when it comes to the diplomatic work that Secretary Kerry and his staff at the State Department have been doing.\xc2\xa0 They\'re bringing together into the same room representatives from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, the United States, our Gulf partners to have this discussion.\xc2\xa0 And those countries disagree on a whole lot and on a whole lot of things that are high priorities to them.\xc2\xa0 But they all recognize that a political transition inside of Syria is necessary to try to bring some semblance of stability to that war-torn country. And there are a lot of difficult questions to answer about what that transition looks like.\xc2\xa0 But I think everybody recognizes that this will be a task that must be completed in order to address the serious risks associated with continued chaos inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ron.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, on the military side, is it still the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position that the Russians are not attacking ISIS and are attacking anti-Assad groups?\xc2\xa0 Is there any evidence that that\'s changed?\xc2\xa0 And was that on the agenda in the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s talks?\xc2\xa0 Was there any progress made on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Based on the recent briefings that I\xe2\x80\x99ve received, the vast majority of military operations that Russia has undertaken inside of Syria since September have not been focused on ISIL, but have actually been focused on areas where ISIL isn\xe2\x80\x99t present but where groups that oppose the Assad regime are present.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this is the underpinning of our argument that Russia is more interested in propping up the Assad regime than in fighting ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And the real problem with that strategy -- well, there are a lot of problems with that strategy, but the most significant one is simply this:\xc2\xa0 Even in the context of the fact-to-face meeting that President Putin had with President Obama back in September at the U.N., even before they started carrying out these military airstrikes, President Putin acknowledged -- he agreed with President Obama that a political transition inside of Syria was necessary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The problem is that as long as Russia continues to take military strikes that are targeted at Assad\xe2\x80\x99s political opponents that only serves to prop up the Assad regime, that makes it harder to achieve the kind of political transition that President Putin himself acknowledges is central to the solution.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the rub here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as much as that contradiction is a source of some frustration to the United States -- as maybe is evident from my tone that I\xe2\x80\x99m using right now and from a tone that you\'ve heard the President use in the past -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a much bigger problem for Russia.\xc2\xa0 They\'re going to be dragged much more deeply into this sectarian civil war that is going to drain their resources and create a significant national security problem for them, or at least -- or even worsen a national security problem for them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I imagine Secretary Kerry took a crack at this in his talks over there.\xc2\xa0 And it seems like even though the Presidents have spoken and -- we\'re at a stalemate here.\xc2\xa0 So, conceivably, you have the Russians actually perhaps attacking some of the groups that are going to be at this meeting in New York of opposition leaders.\xc2\xa0 This seems to be -- how do you make any progress as long as that dynamic, that military dynamic is still there?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say, Ron, it\xe2\x80\x99s not obvious.\xc2\xa0 And this is why there has been so much intensive consultation between Secretary Kerry and his counterpart.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has spoken to President Putin twice in the last six weeks.\xc2\xa0 This is an important part of those conversations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I will say that a lot of those conversations are also focused on the need for Russia to stop their destabilizing activities inside of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 That is what has led Russia to become so isolated.\xc2\xa0 And certainly when President Obama has an opportunity to speak with President Putin, that is an important part of their conversations.\xc2\xa0 Maybe even the majority of time is spent on those issues.\xc2\xa0 But when they do talk about Syria, this question that you have honed in on has been a central part of their discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the gun issue, someone asked earlier and you\'ve never really wanted to reveal anything about the work of this committee that\'s scrubbing these laws and so forth.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there -- can you give us any reason why you can\'t tell us more about what they\'re doing?\xc2\xa0 And is the President and the administration concerned that the moment might be passing now?\xc2\xa0 He addressed the nation on these issues.\xc2\xa0 The San Bernardino incident is still fresh, but what\xe2\x80\x99s taking so long?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the hold up?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us anything about what the problem is?\xc2\xa0 I mean, these issues have been out there for a long time.\xc2\xa0 Can you just not find a legal justification for doing this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that our problem right now is that Congress will not support common-sense legislation that would make the country safer without undermining the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.\xc2\xa0 That is the central problem.\xc2\xa0 So part of our solution is to consider the range of authorities that are vested in the executive branch to try to advance some of those common-sense policies.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly do want to make sure that any sort of steps that the President would take have a strong legal basis in the law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seemed stuck in that place for a long time now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I can understand the sense of urgency that you feel.\xc2\xa0 I assure you that the President and his team that\'s working on this shares that sense of urgency, because there are innocent lives that are being lost.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not just talking about in the context terrorist incidents like the one we saw in San Bernardino.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not even just talking about the kind of mass shooting incidents that get so much attention -- particularly in Colorado Springs, or the Oregon incident that I mentioned earlier.\xc2\xa0 There are innocent lives lost in cities all across America every day from firearms being wielded by individuals who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have them.\xc2\xa0 And we need to find common-sense steps that will make it harder for those individuals to get those guns.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re not going to be able to take an executive action or pass a law that will prevent every single act of gun violence.\xc2\xa0 We\'re just not -- we\'re going to be realistic about this.\xc2\xa0 But there are common-sense things that can be done that would make our country safer, that would make it harder for criminals and the mentally ill to get their hands on a firearm.\xc2\xa0 And we can do that without undermining the basic constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Secret Service Officer Baldwin, who was shot and killed in Southwest Washington, I believe he was assigned to the White House branch, which is why I ask about this.\xc2\xa0 Do you know anything more about what happened?\xc2\xa0 And are you concerned that -- we don\'t know all of the facts, but this is another Secret Service officer from the Uniform Division that may be involved in something that\'s tragic and perhaps worse than that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ron, I\'ll say that I do not have access to a lot of the details of this particular case.\xc2\xa0 I\'d refer you to Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 They may have some more information they can share with you at some point.\xc2\xa0 But I will just say that obviously our condolences go out to the family of the officer that was killed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just lastly, Adam Szubin\xe2\x80\x99s status is what -- was there some movement?\xc2\xa0 I thought -- no?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, no.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I do think that all of you had an opportunity to see how critical his efforts are to our national security.\xc2\xa0 As we were discussing what he was going to say today, we were talking in my office about the fact that he recently has spent a lot of time traveling in the Middle East, through the UAE and other countries with whom we work closely, not just focused on counter-ISIL efforts, but actually to counter the financing of Hezbollah.\xc2\xa0 I think everybody in the United States Congress, Democrat and Republican, recognizes the threat that that terrorist organization poses to our interests at least in the region and the destabilizing impact that they continue to have, including in places like Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a lot of ways in which his efforts have a significant impact on our basic national security.\xc2\xa0 And this is the thing.\xc2\xa0 When he travels around the world representing the United States he walks in the door with that \xe2\x80\x9cacting\xe2\x80\x9d title in front of his name.\xc2\xa0 And while he obviously I think commands a lot of respect when he walks in the room, and certainly as he describes the kind of policies that the United States has implemented with our partners around the world to make countries safer, he builds a lot of credibility.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who deserves the respect at least of the Republicans in Congress who have been blocking his nomination for more than a year.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is Mr. Szubin entered this line of work in a Republican administration at the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that politics should be involved here.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the individual that the Bush administration appointed to run this office, Stuart Levey, is actually somebody who served under President Obama.\xc2\xa0 So there is a long tradition of individuals who fulfill this basic responsibility from not being subject to partisanship.\xc2\xa0 They certainly haven\'t been treated that way by the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s, frankly, gross the way that Republicans in Congress -- Chairman Shelby, in particular -- have subjected this nonpartisan national security official to petty partisanship.</p>\n<p>\n\tLauren.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Up until that \xe2\x80\x9cfrankly, gross\xe2\x80\x9d comment, I thought we were sort of on a bipartisan mood today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be -- it would be pretty easy for Republicans in Congress -- because here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 What I could say about Senator Shelby -- I\'m getting back to bipartisanship here -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 This is what it is.\xc2\xa0 Chairman Shelby has acknowledged that Mr. Szubin is eminently qualified for his job.\xc2\xa0 I think all of you come away with that impression after hearing his presentation.\xc2\xa0 And Mr. Szubin has testified on more than one occasion before Senator Shelby\xe2\x80\x99s committee.\xc2\xa0 So Republicans in Congress certainly understand how qualified he is and that he certainly takes a nonpartisan approach to doing his job.\xc2\xa0 And they understand how central his day-to-day work is to our national security.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason this should be a partisan issue.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m happy to not make this a partisan issue either.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Speaker Ryan has tweeted out that he has completed two bipartisan agreements that advance the priorities of the Republican Party this week.\xc2\xa0 He used that earlier -- \xe2\x80\x9cWe succeeded.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Does this mean that the President is pleased with Speaker Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s leadership?\xc2\xa0 Is there a change in tone in D.C. that we could see moving forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, there certainly has been a willingness on the part of Speaker Ryan and other leading Republicans in Congress -- he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only person involved -- in trying to find common ground between Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And the President entered this office confident that we could advance the priorities of the American people, not by capitulating on our principles, but actually having Democrats and Republicans come together, focus on our shared priorities, focus on the common ground that can be seized, and focus on how we can advance the interests of middle-class families all across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that every bill that is passed by Congress and signed into law by the President is going to be perfect in the eyes of members of Congress and the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 But it does mean we surely should be able to compromise.\xc2\xa0 And the willingness of Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell and other Republicans to compromise on this proposal I think is clearly in the best interest of the country, is clearly in the best interest of our national security, and I am optimistic that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be good for our economy over the long term, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another question.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow you\xe2\x80\x99re rolling out another faith-based initiative.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cKnow Your Neighbor.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I know my neighbors pretty well, and I bet you do.\xc2\xa0 What is the goal of this program?\xc2\xa0 And why are you launching it now?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Lauren, let me get back to you with some details on this program.\xc2\xa0 But this clearly is a priority, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up with you on some details.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on Syria, you said earlier that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s priorities appears, in this answer to Ron, appears to be to continue to prop up Assad in the context of ISIL.\xc2\xa0 When Secretary Kerry left the meeting -- three and a half hour meeting with Putin yesterday, he came to the podium and still said there\xe2\x80\x99s no agreement on what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen to Assad.\xc2\xa0 So can you explain to us the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking on what an acceptable role for Assad would be in this new transitional government that\xe2\x80\x99s being created?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to articulate from here because, again, I think this is going to be part of what will be discussed by the international community in New York later this week.\xc2\xa0 And our view is steadfast. \xc2\xa0It is that President Assad has lost legitimacy to lead that country, not just because his actions are morally repugnant in terms of the way that he is using the military to attack his own people, but also because, as a practical matter, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to succeed in uniting and governing a country that you spent the last five years attacking.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just as a purely practical matter, we need to see some new leadership inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 And the question is, how do we bring that about, and who is that person or who is that group going to be?\xc2\xa0 And there are a lot of countries in the region that have a vested interest in figuring out how this is going to work.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the United States that this needs to be a process that reflects the desires and ambitions of the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Assad could be the Prime Minister, he could have another role in the government; he just can\xe2\x80\x99t be the President?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that the Syrian people, most of whom have been violently attacked by Bashar al-Assad, are going to be at all supportive of him having a senior role in their government.\xc2\xa0 But again, the Syrian people will have to decide that.\xc2\xa0 But it would be I guess an irrational decision for them to suggest that he somehow is up to that kind of responsibility.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be pretty hard for the Syrian people, for a million of whom have fled the country and millions more displaced, but then to decide through voting, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be negotiated.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s part of what\xe2\x80\x99s being negotiated, is who does what for how long in this new transitional government.\xc2\xa0 So is it not frustrating to President Obama that there is no timeline still for Assad\xe2\x80\x99s departure, and we\xe2\x80\x99re about to enter on Friday a peace process to hammer out a trajectory within that country?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s not being hammered out by the Syrian people, that\xe2\x80\x99s being negotiated by diplomats.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly diplomats are going to put together a process that we believe can be effective in bringing about this kind of political transition.\xc2\xa0 But this is not something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be negotiated over the heads of the Syrian people, or at least those elements of the Syrian opposition, political and otherwise, who have a legitimate claim to participating in these kinds of talks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a long-term solution for the intelligence community to try to step in and essentially impose the kind of political changes that we believe are best for Syria.\xc2\xa0 We certainly have some thoughts about that; we\xe2\x80\x99ll share them and that will be part of the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately this must be, both in appearance and in fact, something that reflects the will and ambition of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why this effort to cobble together the Syrian opposition into some coherent body is painstaking and frustrating work, but is central to our success.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be frustrating for the President to look at the timeline for his own departure and look over at Bashar al-Assad, a man you described as a mass murderer, and have none for him.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, there is a much stronger tradition of democracy in the United States than there is in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s one reason, frankly, that the United States continues to be the greatest country in the world and a country that can exert such substantial influence in these kinds of discussions.\xc2\xa0 It certainly adds to the credibility of our government when we walk in there and we say, well, the current President of the United States is not carrying out mass attacks against its citizens, but yet he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do the responsible thing.\xc2\xa0 And when his term is up he\xe2\x80\x99s going to leave.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a heck of a slogan.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it fits on a bumper sticker.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But can\xe2\x80\x99t you explicitly say here -- because Secretary Kerry was pretty explicit in saying we don\xe2\x80\x99t need regime change.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re just talking about the guy himself, Bashar al-Assad; we don\xe2\x80\x99t need regime change.\xc2\xa0 Can\xe2\x80\x99t you explicitly say this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about \xe2\x80\x9cAssad has to go\xe2\x80\x9d anymore, it\xe2\x80\x99s about what role he plays in the future?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, it is hard to imagine a rational Syrian voter deciding that somebody --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine a Syrian voter.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is part of the painstaking diplomatic work that is underway.\xc2\xa0 But it is -- we will see what this process looks like.\xc2\xa0 It will play out not just in the short term; this is going to require the sustained effort of the international community, led by the United States, to get there.\xc2\xa0 But based on, just as a practical matter, what Assad has done, the violence that he has perpetrated has basically caused him to lose legitimacy to play a leadership role in that country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you quickly on the omnibus?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It looked like the Republicans were saying they were happy as to what they got on Gitmo, which was a ban against transfers and a block on funding to modify, build, or use any kind of facility to hold prisoners.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House still trying and still believe that they can shut down Gitmo?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The language that they\xe2\x80\x99re referring to I believe is consistent, if not identical, with the language that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Republicans include in other pieces of legislation, including the NDAA.\xc2\xa0 So obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve objected to the inclusion of that language in other bills, and we certainly object to the inclusion of that language in this bill, as well.\xc2\xa0 But it certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t preclude the closing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay continues to be a top priority of the President.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d just note that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t just the priority of this President, it was a priority expressed by the previous President and by Democratic and Republican national security officials that have served Democratic and Republicans Presidents quite proudly.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 JC.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the topic of chaos and violence -- not the domestic kind, but the international kind -- and to follow up on Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s query about when there are leaders who have gone and there\xe2\x80\x99s vacuums created -- certainly ISIL has taken advantage of the situation, the crisis in Libya, and there\xe2\x80\x99s warring factions going on there.\xc2\xa0 And there seems to be a summit in Rome going on now, where U.S. -- U.N. and European officials are gathering, and they are backing a proposed peace plan between the warring factions in Libya.\xc2\xa0 How confident are you and is the President in this particular deal taking place, happening, and becoming something that could be really quite an improvement over the situation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that these are also conversations that Secretary Kerry had the opportunity to participate in earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 There is a U.N.-led political process in Libya that\xe2\x80\x99s advanced farther than the Syria process has.\xc2\xa0 But obviously there are significant challenges facing the people and government of Libya.\xc2\xa0 And we do believe that putting in place a stronger, more stable governing structure inside of Libya must be one that reflects the will of the Libyan people.\xc2\xa0 But it will certainly play a role in making it harder for ISIL to establish a safe haven inside of Libya.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These officials are confident that this peace plan is actually taking shape, that they think this may come off?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated assessment of the talks for you, but certainly this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on and this is a priority, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why Secretary Kerry was participating in those talks just a couple of days ago.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gardiner.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President seen the new \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars\xe2\x80\x9d film?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And if so, what\xe2\x80\x99s he think of it?\xc2\xa0 If not, does he plan to?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have not asked him about it, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he has had the opportunity to see it yet.\xc2\xa0 But I am confident that the President will at some point see the movie.\xc2\xa0 But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to talk to him about it yet.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dave, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Back on the budget.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about Republican leaders\xe2\x80\x99 ability to compromise.\xc2\xa0 Where did the President compromise the most in this budget?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess by compromise I think it means sort of tolerate the inclusion of some Republican priorities in the bill.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think the two things that I would highlight are actually a couple of things that have already been addressed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The first would be the legislation to lift the ban on crude oil -- the ban on exports of crude oil.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a policy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve supported, but it will not prevent the President from signing this bill.\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve explained why that is different than many of the other ideological riders that we succeeded in keeping off the bill.\xc2\xa0 So that would be the first thing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the second thing is some of the changes to the Affordable Care Act are not nearly as significant as the kinds of changes that Republicans routinely advocate for.\xc2\xa0 But they aren\xe2\x80\x99t the kinds of changes that we support.\xc2\xa0 There are some in there that are, but certainly the suspension of the \xe2\x80\x9cCadillac tax\xe2\x80\x9d for two years and the suspension of the medical device tax for two years are not proposals that are supported by the administration, but we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to go along with it because of the important measures that are included in this legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back when John Boehner retired, there was a lot of talk that these budget negotiations were going to become much more complicated and much more difficult.\xc2\xa0 Do you see any difference now that the dust has settled?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think we have seen a willingness on the part of Republicans to compromise.\xc2\xa0 I think one thing that is consistent with previous negotiations is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the deadline slip a little bit a couple of times, but there has been a good-faith effort on the part of Republicans to try to find some common ground here.\xc2\xa0 And I think that will be reflected in the final votes.\xc2\xa0 There will be some Democrats and some Republicans that oppose this, but I think that we will see a bipartisan majority in support of a compromise proposal.\xc2\xa0 And the country is very well served by that kind of legislative process.\xc2\xa0 And Democrats and Republicans both deserve credit for that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, the other undeniable factor here is that Senator McConnell and Speaker Ryan didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to preside over a government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 Leader McConnell recognized at the beginning of this year that being in the majority in the United States Senate was going to be a real test for Republicans in terms of whether or not they could be trusted to govern the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd while there have been a lot of fits and starts over the course of this year, and whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the confirmation of the Attorney General that lasted much longer than it should have, or the delay in confirming Adam Szubin, or the passing of some common-sense gun safety measures, there have been some fits and starts here -- but arriving at this kind of common-sense proposal is a credit to the willingness of Republican leaders to actually work constructively with Democrats to advance the best interests of the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think something similar could be said about Speaker Ryan, but I think in some ways his concerns may have been a little bit more acute.\xc2\xa0 He was brought in to try to solve the dysfunction in the House of Representatives, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think shutting down the government six weeks into his tenure would be sending the kind of signal that he was hoping to send.\xc2\xa0 So certainly their interest in trying to reach an agreement was an important part of the success that the entire country will reap the benefits of.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:27 P.M.
