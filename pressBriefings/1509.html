As you know, my Administration is actively responding to H1N1 and has appropriately utilized the emergency appropriations that Congress provided for development and procurement of 2009-H1N1 vaccine, domestic and international surveillance activities, and continuing to prepare for an immunization campaign this fall.<br/> <br/>  On July 16, 2009, I designated $1.825 billion of the contingent appropriation as emergency funds required to address critical needs related to emerging influenza viruses (specifically, the virus known as 2009-H1N1). To further enhance our Nation\'s capability to respond to the potential spread of this outbreak, in accordance with the appropriation, I hereby designate an additional $2.716 billion to support the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Health and Human Services, State, and Veterans Affairs to support the procurement of vaccine product and supplies, antiviral medications, preparations for a vaccination campaign, and agency preparedness activities. <br/> <br/>  There continues to be much uncertainty about the severity of the outbreak this fall during the northern hemisphere flu season. A vaccine is under development and currently being tested for safety and efficacy. Results from the clinical trials, along with the latest information regarding the evolution of the 2009-H1N1 virus and the worldwide outbreaks, will inform our decisions regarding<br/>  the national response.<br/> <br/>  We will communicate with you further in the future should additional funds be required.<br/> <br/>  Sincerely,<br/>  BARACK OBAMA</div></div></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
