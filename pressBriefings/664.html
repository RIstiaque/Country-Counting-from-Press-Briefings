Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>The Administration released a Statement of Administration Policy last night indicating that if the President were presented with H.R. 2642, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.</p>\n<p>1:07 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here, as ever.\xc2\xa0 Before I go to questions, I have two things to note.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>First, the President had a good discussion with Senators Schumer and McCain about the importance of common-sense immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that there is a broad coalition to support common-sense immigration reform and we are pleased the House recognizes that inaction is not an option.\xc2\xa0 There is support from CEOs and labor leaders, from faith leaders and law enforcement leaders, from Democrats and from Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'re pleased also that they are, in the House, moving forward and we stand willing to work with all parties to make sure that common-sense immigration reform becomes a reality as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 We talked yesterday about the enormous economic benefit that passage and implementation of comprehensive immigration reform would bring to the country -- increase in GDP, productivity, significant reduction in the deficit.\xc2\xa0 And the counter to that is that the cost of inaction is very high.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we want to thank Senators Schumer and McCain for coming today.</p>\n<p>Separately, I want to note for you, on your behalf, that your ballots are due by 4 p.m. -- (laughter) -- in the White House Correspondents Association election.\xc2\xa0 So exercise your right:\xc2\xa0 Cast a vote.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- elections.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t vote.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have that right.\xc2\xa0 Would that I could.\xc2\xa0 I\'m making no endorsements.\xc2\xa0 I think that anybody who actually -- I remember from being here as a reporter covering the White House and obviously now, seeing it from the other side, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty demanding and in many ways thankless responsibility.\xc2\xa0 So I think everyone should at the very least offer their appreciation to those of your colleagues who make the effort, run for these slots, and then actually fulfill the responsibilities, because there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of glory in it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Associated Press.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner said today that the vast majority of House Republicans believe that they need to tackle immigration reform but that border security has to come first.\xc2\xa0 And the White House has said all along that the border is as secure as it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been.\xc2\xa0 It seems like, on that particular issue, it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of going toward a stalemate -- House Repubs on this side, the White House on that side.\xc2\xa0 How does the White House move that from stalemate to resolution so you can get movement on so many parts of immigration reform?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no question that we\'ve made enormous progress in the past five years on border security, and there are a variety of ways to measure that that demonstrate that that progress has taken place.\xc2\xa0 But on the issue of whether or not we need to further improve our border security, I think Republicans in the House and the President agree, as do Democrats.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has long made it one of the criteria that he insists upon in comprehensive immigration reform, that it include improvements to our border security.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, in the process that led to the bill that cleared the Senate with a bipartisan majority, an amendment was passed that dedicates significant resources, new resources, to enhancing our border security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as Senator McCain has said in the past, anybody who says that the Senate bill does not contain significant border security measures is not really serious about border security, because it is an absolute fact that that Senate process created -- led to a result that provides significant resources towards border security and reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to enhancing our border security.</p>\n<p>So our view of where we are now is that we continue to move forward; that it is a good sign that House leaders believe that inaction is not an option; that the cost of inaction is high, in our view, both economically, morally, politically; and that, therefore, we will continue to work with members of both parties in both houses to move this process forward and to see immigration reform passed and signed into the law as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the stakeout after the meeting, Senator McCain said that President Obama should address immigration, he should speak out on it.\xc2\xa0 McCain said that he and Schumer would also be traveling the country to talk about it and promote it, et cetera, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 Will the President also travel and talk up the issue now that it\xe2\x80\x99s moved from the Senate to House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has on numerous occasions spoken about the need to enact comprehensive immigration reform and his views on comprehensive immigration reform, and he will continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 And he has used all the tools in his toolbox to help bring us to the point where we have a bipartisan bill that cleared the Senate and progress in the House.</p>\n<p>So we will make our decisions about what the President does, who he talks to, how he addresses the issue, in accordance with what we think will help move this ball down the field.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done in the past and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And I think that Senator McCain -- and we appreciate that -- recognized that the President has played and will play an important role in this process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But as I said yesterday, this is obviously much bigger than him.\xc2\xa0 By definition, when you have the kind of consensus we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen among labor leaders and business leaders and faith leaders and law enforcement leaders, Democrats and Republicans, this is an issue that transcends any individual, even the President.\xc2\xa0 And I think his commitment to working with Congress and being willing to compromise in order to get something significant done demonstrates his commitment to the issue, as opposed to the politics behind the issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more quickly on Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Is there any comment from the White House on the bill that Senator Paul introduced today to cut off aid to Egypt?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is our view that we should not immediately suspend or change our assistance program to Egypt.\xc2\xa0 We are reviewing our obligations under the law, and reviewing them with an eye towards our national security interests and with an eye towards our objective here, which is to do everything we can to assist the Egyptian people in their transition to democracy and their transition, we hope, to a democratically elected civilian government.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s our view.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific response to any proposed legislation.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that precipitous action here is not the right action.\xc2\xa0 We will review our obligations; we will review what took place.\xc2\xa0 We are mindful of the fact that, while we are concerned about the events that led to the removal of President Morsi from office, the fact is that millions of Egyptians do not see what happened as a coup, and they believe that and they amply demonstrated their belief that there should be a change in government.</p>\n<p>So for all the reasons that we\'ve talked about all week, we are going to be very deliberate and cautious as we assess this and as we review our assistance programs.\xc2\xa0 And the President has asked that all the agencies involved in assistance to Egypt, including, of course, the Defense Department, review those assistance programs as we make these evaluations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to draw you out further on immigration, Senator McCain was saying it\'s important for the President to be respectful of the process, not be too heavy handed while he\'s trying to influence the discussion.\xc2\xa0 Is the President doing that? Does he plan to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 To be heavy handed?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no -- to strike a balance?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ve seen in the way that the President has approached this issue his desire to have -- when the process was in the Senate, have the Senate demonstrate its ability to forge a bipartisan compromise.\xc2\xa0 He and others at the White House obviously worked together with Senate leaders and staff of both parties as that process moved forward, and we continue to work with other lawmakers in the House and the Senate as this issue continues to develop.</p>\n<p>As I said earlier to Darlene, we will engage, as we have all along, and the President will engage, as he has all along, and he will make clear his support for and his insistence upon comprehensive immigration reform because it\'s the right thing for our economy and it\'s the right thing for our people.\xc2\xa0 How that manifests itself, what events he may hold, we\'ll have to see, because we\'re going to make those judgments as this issue ripens over the next weeks and months.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The signal we\'re hearing from the Hill is that this probably won\'t get done by the August recess.\xc2\xa0 Is that your understanding as well?\xc2\xa0 Does that worry you at all?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have said all along that the Congress should address this deliberately but quickly.\xc2\xa0 There has been obviously a great amount of time spent over the years, certainly since the middle of the last decade, on this issue.\xc2\xa0 A lot of work has been done.\xc2\xa0 A lot of work was done to produce the bipartisan Senate bill, and now work is being done in the House.\xc2\xa0 So we believe that the House can and should act quickly.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t control the House so we obviously have to work with the House, as the Senate does, as they move through this issue.</p>\n<p>We were encouraged, as Senators McCain and Schumer said they were encouraged, by the statements from leaders in the House that they recognize the need to act on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And so we will continue to work with Congress, both houses, leaders in both parties, as well as rank-and-file members, as well as all the stakeholders out there in this issue as we move forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, to follow up on that, the House Republican leadership put out a statement yesterday and they reiterated today that they are not going to take up the Senate bill, that they would prefer a more step-by-step approach.\xc2\xa0 And there are several members in the House that have advocated a piecemeal approach to immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 Would the President reject that if it were to come out of the House and Senate after they go to conference, particularly if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include a path to citizenship for the undocumented?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has always made clear that the right way to do this is comprehensively and that the criteria he laid out are essential to successful comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And among those criteria were improved border security and a clear pathway to citizenship, a mechanism to improve legal immigration, and also, of course, to ensure that everybody was playing by the same rules, including all businesses in their hiring.\xc2\xa0 And those elements are reflected in the Senate bill that passed with a bipartisan majority, a significant bipartisan majority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our takeaway from the readouts of the meeting in the House is that there is a recognition that action has to be taken here. And we consider that a good sign that progress is possible.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to game out how that progress is going to play out.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there are leaders in the House and others who will decide what happens.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that we need to act on comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We believe that, as we demonstrated yesterday, the benefits of comprehensive immigration reform are enormous for the country.\xc2\xa0 I mean we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about $850 billion in deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, a good portion of the two and a half years that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at this podium has been dedicated to discussions between you and me about how we go about reducing our deficit and the differing ideas that the President has and the Republicans have, Democrats as well as the President, on how to do this, and the Republican insistence that deficit reduction is perhaps their top priority.\xc2\xa0 Well, here is an excellent way to achieve that as you go about achieving a significant and important goal that goes beyond deficit reduction.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with members of both parties in both houses to get this done.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely essential that we do get it done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is going to insist on a path to citizenship?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has always said that a path to citizenship is essential to immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 That was one of the central elements that he put forward.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to certain parts of what the President proposed, what the Senate passed.\xc2\xa0 Not everything in the Senate bill is as the President would have written it.\xc2\xa0 In fact, not everything in the Senate bill is as it would have been written by individual members of the Gang of Eight.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s what compromise is about.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be part of this process that we hope will forge a compromise and a consensus and a bill that has broad support in both houses of Congress and can be signed by the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about an item in The Washington Post that\xe2\x80\x99s up on their website right now that is noting that the international flights going from Moscow to Havana seem to be taking a different flight path and that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going over U.S. soil.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious -- would an international flight carrying Mr. Snowden be welcome if it were flying over U.S. soil, or would the U.S. prefer that it not take that path?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the agencies that handle flight paths. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the story, but I\xe2\x80\x99m also not aware that you would need to fly over U.S. soil to get to Havana from Moscow.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not an aviation expert.\xc2\xa0 But let me say that our position on Mr. Snowden is what it was, which is that we believe that, and have communicated this to numerous countries, that he should be returned to the United States, where he faces felony charges and is accused of serious crimes.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that there is significant legal justification for him to be expelled from Russia and to engage in only the international travel necessary to be returned to the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The only reason why I ask is there are international flights that are taken over land as much as possible in the event of an emergency, and these flights seem to be going over water.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not familiar with those flight paths.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing, on the Trayvon Martin-George Zimmerman trial that\xe2\x80\x99s happening now.\xc2\xa0 The President once said that if he had a son, he would look like Trayvon Martin.\xc2\xa0 Is the President watching this trial, and does he have any concerns as to what the response might be once it\xe2\x80\x99s come to its conclusion?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that -- well, the President, as you know, does not spend a lot of time watching television during the day, but his comments on that are what they were.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to say anything from here in the midst of a trial of that nature.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on the Travyon Martin case?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, April, and then Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, really fast.\xc2\xa0 Is the Justice Department watching for the outcome on this Trayvon Martin case on civil rights matters?\xc2\xa0 Because we understand while before the trial, all the investigations, there was an investigation into civil rights violations and things like that.\xc2\xa0 Is the Justice Department watching the outcome, and will they be reporting back to the President once this trial is over to talk about possibilities?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I would ask the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, airspace -- what about American airspace from Russia?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s just not something I\xe2\x80\x99m familiar with, so I would refer you to the Pentagon or elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 Our position on this and what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done regarding it is the same as it was yesterday and for many previous days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President has commented from this podium a couple of times that on certain issues his voice can be an irritant to House Republicans.\xc2\xa0 It can make things more difficult because if he lobbies too aggressively, House Republicans reflexively oppose him.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talked about that in the context of the fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 Does he have any anxieties about this as far as immigration reform, and is he going to calibrate his public advocacy because of that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President will take the steps that he believes can help this process reach a positive conclusion.\xc2\xa0 You have seen us do that in the process thus far, and that has included speaking about the matter, both before large audiences and small.\xc2\xa0 It has included giving interviews where he\xe2\x80\x99s discussed the need for comprehensive immigration reform and the criteria that he thinks are essential to comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think that we will approach this as we have in the past, with a mind --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he share the same concerns about immigration that he\xe2\x80\x99s expressed about fiscal matters, where he has become an irritant in the House Republican context?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that he has a fairly sophisticated and nuanced appreciation for how the politics of all of the issues that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with right now play out, and he will engage in a way that he thinks can be most effective.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, as Senators McCain and Schumer said today and others have noted, his role in this is important.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He\xe2\x80\x99s the President.\xc2\xa0 He is, in many ways, a central reason why we are where we are.\xc2\xa0 Because, as we know, in the hard-fought election last year for President, there were two very opposing views on this issue, and had President Obama not been reelected, it is safe to assume that the position of the President and of the Republican Party would be what the position was of the Republican nominee, which is the way to deal with our immigration challenge and the fact that the system is broken is through self-deportation, which is not a position that obviously reflects where we are today or where numerous Republican leaders are today.</p>\n<p>So his role in this has been significant.\xc2\xa0 But as I said yesterday, this is bigger than the President.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about who wins on this issue at a political level.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about doing something extremely important for our country.\xc2\xa0 The system, as President George W. Bush said yesterday, is -- the system that governs our immigration is broken.\xc2\xa0 We need to fix it.\xc2\xa0 And there is an opportunity here to do that in a bipartisan way that would bequeath enormous benefits to our economy going forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand your desire to accentuate the positive, but aren\xe2\x80\x99t there some frustrating aspects as well from this White House\xe2\x80\x99s point of view about what came out of that Republican meeting yesterday?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not going to act before the break.\xc2\xa0 This issue, then, necessarily becomes involved in a lot of other complicated legislative maneuvering around the debt ceiling, about continuing resolutions if one is necessary, the appropriations cycle.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have been happier and isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a degree of frustration with just a very slender commitment that something needs to be done, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be piecemeal, not comprehensive, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be timely, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get involved necessarily in a lot of these other issues that are equally politically charged, if not more so?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has known all along that this would be a challenge, like so many of these issues that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been accomplished because it\xe2\x80\x99s hard, and that requires --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was true yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about specific things that you now know to be true -- scheduling thing that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that we know today that is different from what we knew yesterday about how challenging this would be to bring to conclusion, successful conclusion.\xc2\xa0 But there is an enormous amount of consensus here.\xc2\xa0 There is a bill that emerged from the Senate that represents what bipartisan cooperation can look like on a big issue like immigration reform. And there is recognition in the House by Republican leaders that there\xe2\x80\x99s an urgency to do something, to act on this, because the consequences of inaction are significant and severe.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And when you\xe2\x80\x99re moving forward, the momentum builds -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ll acknowledge that there are a lot of obstacles between where we are today and where we want to be, but that has long been the case.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that in the end, the Congress will act on the will of the American people, on the will of the business community, on the will of labor leaders, of faith leaders, of law enforcement leaders, of Republican and Democratic leaders across the country, and get this important piece of business done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more before I let you go.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a very detailed story in the Wall Street Journal today that essentially says Chuck Hagel, the Defense Secretary, is the principal interlocutor with this transitional Egyptian government and that the State Department and the White House are funneling most, if not all, communications with General al-Sisi through Chuck Hagel.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair characterization?\xc2\xa0 And is the conduit of information flow back and forth that narrow right now between this government and the transitional --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that narrow.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Hagel is playing a very important role in this, as you would expect from the Secretary of Defense, and he is in constant contact with his counterparts -- and counterpart, in particular, General al-Sisi\xc2\xa0 -- but Secretary Kerry is engaged daily in conversations with Egyptian counterparts, and others are also engaged, including obviously the Ambassador.\xc2\xa0 So this is an issue that is occupying the time of all of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security leaders.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when those other conversations occur they\xe2\x80\x99re not happening with the person who seems to be at the head of this transitional government.\xc2\xa0 That would seem to put this particular --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would suggest that you don\'t -- that\'s like saying that the only conversation you can have with the U.S. government is with the President.\xc2\xa0 There are governing authorities that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you would concede this transitional Egyptian government is a little less formed than the current U.S. government --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly, but it has been formed and we are dealing with a number of leaders in the transitional government, making the point to every one of them that the military must show, in our view, maximum restraint, that all parties ought to refrain from violence, and that it is incumbent upon this transitional government to ensure, if it hopes to carry out the plan that they laid forward, to ensure the participation of all groups and all parties and all individuals in that process, because the only way this is going to work successfully for the Egyptian people is if all parties are encouraged and allowed to participate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\'s why we\'ve made clear that arbitrary arrests are not anything that -- that we could not support those.\xc2\xa0 Because if you\'re arresting individuals from one group or one party, you\'re working against yourself if your effort is to be inclusive as you make this transition back to a civilian, democratically elected government.</p>\n<p>Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s actions regarding the Affordable Care Act, does that delay the employer mandate, or just the reporting requirement?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would ask you to address that question to the Treasury.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that the Treasury Department put out very clear language yesterday in a letter that they -- or they provided a letter to the Hill that I think has been put out now about the authority that exists to allow for this delay in the implementation of a provision of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 But the specificity behind it you would have to ask the Treasury Department about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason I ask is because Pelosi says it\xe2\x80\x99s just the reporting requirement and that the mandate itself remains.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how that\xe2\x80\x99s possible.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the implementation of the mandate has been postponed a year -- the deadline -- but the law is the law.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been expunged, as much as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure some members of Congress wish it were.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the cost to the government of doing this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask the Treasury Department, Wendell.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what costs are associated with it, if any. The Treasury Department would have the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 They are the authority that executes on this.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Republican conference yesterday expressed a lack of trust in the President and this administration when they were referring to the immigration reform bill, but specifically they were making reference to the Affordable Care Act as well.\xc2\xa0 There was some commentary from some Republicans today on the Hill who said, \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the issues is, what would stop the President from not enforcing this law\xe2\x80\x9d -- in reference to the immigration reform bill that\xe2\x80\x99s passed through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 So I just want to get a sense, if the employer mandate was delayed a year, Republicans insist, then why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President, if pressured by big business, perhaps delay or not enforce something like an employment verification system that he\xe2\x80\x99s not been heavily in favor of?\xc2\xa0 What do you say to those people who doubt that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- again, I got this exact question almost word for word yesterday, which I know is the sort of Republican talking point.\xc2\xa0 But it is preposterous to suggest that a delay in the implementation of a provision within a law is anything unusual.\xc2\xa0 I have several examples here I could provide to you, and numerous more could be provided to you, and they happened under previous administrations and this one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which is to say the same thing could happen to immigration reform, though, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s like saying that the way that government works is unsatisfying to some members of Congress who are part of government.\xc2\xa0 So this is not unusual.\xc2\xa0 This is a political effort to undermine a law that was passed by Congress, a law that was upheld by the Supreme Court, a law that bequeaths significant benefits to millions and millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0 And this is about an attempt to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Believe me -- and I think you understand this -- the House Republicans who are driving this narrative are not concerned about a delay in the implementation of a law that they oppose.\xc2\xa0 They want to kill the bill -- I mean, they want to kill the law. They want to undermine the law.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve made that clear.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re proud of it.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a fine position to take, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the law, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been upheld by the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the position that they hold -- and this is interesting when you saw some of the members who support repeal and oppose the implementation not just of the employer mandate, but the individual responsibility provision -- they have no answer to what would happen if repeal were to take place.</p>\n<p>One out of two Americans -- half the people in this room -- have a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 The Republican answer to that:\xc2\xa0 Tough luck.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re protected under the Affordable Care Act, half of you, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be if it were repealed.\xc2\xa0 And if you have kids in their early 20s who are on the insurance policy that you hold today, tough luck.\xc2\xa0 And it would be one thing if Republicans had an alternative, but even a faint attempt at providing an alternative, proposing an alternative which the Majority Leader in the House briefly took up was shot down by the ultraconservatives in the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>So the Affordable Care Act is being implemented.\xc2\xa0 It\'s being implemented responsibly.\xc2\xa0 When it came to the delay in the provision that affects 4 percent of businesses with more than 50 employers, we listened to the concerns of business because we want to get this right and it\'s the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you on Syria, very quickly -- and acknowledging that the White House won\'t have any comments on whatever divisions may exist at the Capitol, as you referenced in conversations with us yesterday -- what is the status of the distribution of lethal aid to the opposition groups, to the rebel groups within Syria right now?\xc2\xa0 Yes or no -- has aid already arrived at its destination?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'re in the process of working with Congress on this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates from what I gave earlier in terms of the provision of specific aid.\xc2\xa0 The Defense Department may have more specifics, but as I understand it, we\'re still working with Congress on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you satisfied by the pace then, given the fact that the reports of aid has yet to reach --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We think it\'s important that we continue to step up the provision of aid, as the President made clear was his policy, and that we believe is essential to strengthening the opposition, which is under significant assault by Bashar al-Assad, coupled with the support that Assad has been getting from Hezbollah and Iran.\xc2\xa0 So we believe that it is important to continue to increase the support that we provide to the Syrian opposition and we\'ll work with Congress to make that happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, Camp Leatherneck in southwest Afghanistan, they call it the big white elephant that nobody wants -- this is a 64,000-square-foot U.S. military headquarter that I think the construction or the plans began in 2009 -- $34 million was the cost.\xc2\xa0 The Inspector General came out with a report about this specifically, and then on camera said that he was "outraged."\xc2\xa0 Republicans, or at least opponents of this administration, would suggest this just outlines a waste of money by this administration.\xc2\xa0 Is the President outraged by this spending?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen the report.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re obviously outraged by wasteful spending in general.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not aware of this report or any specifics about the base that you describe.\xc2\xa0 But this President\'s commitment to reducing wasteful spending is strong and has been demonstrated through the numerous actions he\'s taken to reduce waste.</p>\n<p>Peter.\xc2\xa0 Peter two.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What can the White House do to sustain the momentum on immigration coming from the -- this strong vote that you got out of the Senate and keep House members focused on this issue if it goes into the fall?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What can we do in general, or if it goes into the fall?\xc2\xa0 We\'re just going to keep pressing for the consensus that has already built up around comprehensive immigration reform to continue to grow, and for House members to acknowledge what others have said is the urgency of the need to act now, that inaction is not an option.</p>\n<p>As I said earlier, in answer to earlier questions, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to engage in the ways that we have, mindful of what produces the best outcome here.\xc2\xa0 And we have been very engaged thus far and will continue to be very engaged in this process.\xc2\xa0 Again, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be where we are today if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the positions the President took and the positions he took to the American people in the fall of 2012.</p>\n<p>So we remain hopeful and optimistic that the Congress will eventually act on this, and we believe they should act soon because the consensus is there.\xc2\xa0 Business supports it.\xc2\xa0 Labor supports it.\xc2\xa0 Faith leaders support it.\xc2\xa0 Law enforcement supports it.\xc2\xa0 The bill that passed the Senate provides a huge amount of resources for increased border security.\xc2\xa0 The bill fulfills the criteria that all the leaders on this issue said need to be part of comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And there is a continually building consensus here behind this effort, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with everybody involved -- Republicans, Democrats, stakeholders around the country -- to make the case for this important piece of business.</p>\n<p>Yes, Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, today you told us that you\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that the House recognizes that inaction is not an option, and yesterday you said that you felt that a lot of the Republicans were acting out of fear of a challenge from the right --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I said that it would be a shame if this important piece of legislation that would provide so many benefits to our economy and our businesses and the middle class would be blocked because of concerns by some House members in the Republican Party about primary challenges from the far right.\xc2\xa0 That would seem to me not a great justification for blocking legislation that has such enormous bipartisan support and enormous support across the country from communities that don\'t always agree -- business and labor, Republicans and Democrats, and the like.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, following the outcome of their meeting, how much do you feel that that\'s still in play?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That what is still in play?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What you\xe2\x80\x99re saying about a fear by some of them that they\'re going to face a challenge --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I have no doubt.\xc2\xa0 Again, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 There was a time when I used to hang out outside the room and get quotes from participants in those meetings.\xc2\xa0 But based on the reporting that your colleagues did and I suppose some of you did, there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously -- there are a range of opinions within the House conference.\xc2\xa0 But what we believe is significant is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a recognition at the leadership level, as well as the rank-and-file level, among some members that inaction is not an option, because the consequences of inaction are significant both economically and, based on the reporting I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, politically.</p>\n<p>Roger Runningen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 One of the governors of the Federal Reserve Board, Elizabeth Duke, submitted her resignation to the President today, effective August 31st.\xc2\xa0 Is the machinery underway to find a replacement?\xc2\xa0 And does the President have any comment?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think our own Amy Brundage tweeted about the President\xe2\x80\x99s appreciation for her service.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have personnel announcements or any announcements about machinery being underway.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, we appreciate her service.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would there be any effort to try to a get a nomination before the August recess?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any personnel scheduling announcements to make.</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is congressional opposition or hesitation the holdup to stepped-up military aid to the opposition in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re working with Congress to address the concerns that some members may have and information that some members desire.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re making it clear our view and the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that we need to take this step to enhance the provision of assistance to the Syrian opposition.</p>\n<p>Does that work for you?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Probably not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question was, is that what\xe2\x80\x99s holding up the aid?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reports of that nature, but we\xe2\x80\x99re working Congress to get this done.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a couple more questions.\xc2\xa0 On the Senate nomination fight, does the President support Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s threat to use the nuclear option to get the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominees confirmed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe that, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve stated many times, that the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominees are highly qualified and ought to be confirmed, and they should not be held up.\xc2\xa0 The posts that Senator Reid spoke about today, the nominees for those posts, have extraordinary credentials and they have bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And some of them -- several of them have been waiting over 100 days for a vote; Gina McCarthy, Tom Perez have waited over 100 days for a vote.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact is -- and, again, the evidence that the charts are sort of eye-popping in the way that they demonstrate this -- Senate Republicans have brought obstructionism to new heights, and it is a problem.\xc2\xa0 Blocking and delaying nominees who are unquestionably qualified is a problem.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, Republicans are choosing and have chosen to play political games instead of fulfilling their constitutional responsibility to confirm executive branch appointments.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve voiced that frustration many times -- I have, the President has, and others have.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of Senate procedure, that is something that we generally defer to the Senate leadership, and so we defer to Senator Reid on the steps that he may or may not take.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly share and have been vocal about sharing the frustration that he expressed today about the obstructionism, the historic obstructionism that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Senate Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a different issue, the President many times has talked about saving Detroit from bankruptcy.\xc2\xa0 And he was talking about the car companies, but the city is in dire straits.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s near bankruptcy.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is the President looking at doing anything to save the city of Detroit from bankruptcy?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know that the President is aware of the situation in Detroit and that administration officials have been in contact with leaders in Detroit.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any plans or proposals that the President has, but we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly aware of the circumstances.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, student loans -- since the Senate measure that would call for a one-year extension failed the other day, is there any attempt to break this impasse?\xc2\xa0 Is the White House involved in these talks?\xc2\xa0 Are they making any progress?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The answer is yes, yes, and yes.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that there is a compromise available on this important issue and that the sides have not been that far apart and we just need to get it done.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged that there seems to be progress on that front.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve been in close contact with senators from both parties to get this done.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been reported that Denis McDonough, in addition to his food delivery responsibilities, has been -- I hope everybody got some doughnuts today -- but that he has been meeting with senators of both parties on this issue.</p>\n<p>And as I have said previously, one of the ways that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing moving forward here has been offering the addition of a cap to a long-term proposal like the President\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s progress on this issue.\xc2\xa0 We believe that it can be done, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working with the Senate to see if we can get it done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you say to the Republican leaders who have said the problem here is not so much on their side as it is divisions among the Democrats, in the Senate especially?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 One is we\xe2\x80\x99re working with the Senate, with members of both parties.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working with leaders in the House as well on this issue to get this done.\xc2\xa0 The House bill asks students to fund deficit reduction, and we have long opposed that approach.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there is, as others have noted, an obvious -- or at least the potential for compromise.\xc2\xa0 And we have been working with lawmakers to make that compromise happen.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s really important.\xc2\xa0 We think that we need to make sure that students don\'t see their rates double, that we implement a bill here that will be retroactive so that the deadline that passed on July 1st is not a problem for students as they secure loans for the coming year.</p>\n<p>And we need to act on it quickly, because families are planning right now for how they are going to pay for college.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that\'s very important to the President.\xc2\xa0 He believes that college affordability is a huge challenge for this nation and a huge challenge for middle-class families, and we should be not taking action in Washington that makes it more difficult for those families and for those students.</p>\n<p>Anita, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We saw Senators McCain and Schumer here today, and I just wondered if you had anything you could tell us about House members -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s interaction with House leadership.\xc2\xa0 I know the last time they were here it was more about foreign than domestic issues.\xc2\xa0 Is he phoning House members?\xc2\xa0 Has he talked to the Speaker?\xc2\xa0 Have you --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no other meetings or conversations of the President to read out.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t read out every meeting and conversation the President has.\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We want you to.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know you do.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>And by that, I\xe2\x80\x99m simply saying that the President has been and will continue to be engaged.\xc2\xa0 He met with Senators Schumer and McCain today.\xc2\xa0 That was a good meeting.\xc2\xa0 I think as you mentioned, you heard from the two senators after that meeting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President and his team are working on this issue every day.\xc2\xa0 It is obviously a priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s that we get comprehensive immigration reform passed and signed into law.\xc2\xa0 It would produce enormous benefits for the economy.\xc2\xa0 It would be good for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 It would ensure that employers across the country all play by the same set of rules.\xc2\xa0 It would ensure that our border security is improved and enhanced, building on the improvements and enhancements that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made already over the past five years.\xc2\xa0 So this is a very high priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p>And he is working with Congress in a variety of ways to help bring this about.\xc2\xa0 But as I said I think in answer to somebody\xe2\x80\x99s question or numerous questions from the front row, there are obstacles here, and we need to navigate around them and over them and sometimes through them to get this done.</p>\n<p>But the good news is we have a lot of help.\xc2\xa0 We have the support of business.\xc2\xa0 We have the support of labor.\xc2\xa0 We have the support of faith communities.\xc2\xa0 We have the support of the law enforcement community.\xc2\xa0 We have the support of Democrats and Republicans across the country as well as here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a consensus here, and there\'s a compelling case to be made on a number of fronts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the fact is, doing nothing comes with a very high cost.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not -- the status quo is bad for the country, and the alternative -- which is passing comprehensive immigration reform -- is to see a reduction in our deficit that\xe2\x80\x99s significant, an increase in productivity that\xe2\x80\x99 significant, an increase in wages that\xe2\x80\x99s significant -- huge benefits that come from harnessing the talent and entrepreneurial imagination of immigrants who disproportionately start businesses and create jobs here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And we need to get about the business of taking advantage of those opportunities and passing this important piece of legislation.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, related to the immigration -- some people say that one of the challenges the President faces in the House is that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a point people on each side of the aisle -- or to be able to invite like a Schumer and a McCain to the White House to talk about immigration from the House.\xc2\xa0 Who does the White House consider to be the point people in the House on immigration reform right now?<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, we have engaged with members and leaders in the House on this issue for some time.\xc2\xa0 There is a process -- the Gang of Seven, now, that\xe2\x80\x99s been underway, and we obviously have been working with the House on that and with leaders.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll continue to do that.</p>\n<p>As has been noted in some of the exchanges we\'ve had earlier in this briefing, there are a variety of ways and means that we can employ here to help this process move forward.\xc2\xa0 And we -- as we move along, we\'re examining all options in terms of what the President can do, what the White House can do, what the administration can do, what we can do working with supporters of comprehensive immigration reform outside of government and around the country.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re doing all of it, because this is important.</p>\n<p>But it is bigger than the President and it\'s bigger than the three gentlemen who met in the Oval Office earlier today, and is bigger than any grouping of Democrats and Republicans that might have a meeting with the President.\xc2\xa0 This is an issue with broad national support from business and labor, and faith and law enforcement communities.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to keep pressing to work their will through a bipartisan process in Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick change, Jay, of subject.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow I believe is the deadline that the President set for the Attorney General to present him with ideas, recommendations for changes related to investigations that involve reporters.\xc2\xa0 Do you know whether the Attorney General is going to be able to meet that deadline tomorrow, and whether the President will be prepared to respond?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have no reason to believe that the deadline won\'t be met.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about a presidential response.\xc2\xa0 But I would refer you to the Department of Justice in terms of meeting the deadline.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden has been meeting with Chinese officials, and he\'s spoken fairly bluntly about the cybersecurity issue.\xc2\xa0 What kind of response has he received, and is the administration satisfied with the response it\'s received so far?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been clear with the Chinese about our concerns with respect to cybersecurity, and have made it a key point of discussion with China at all levels, and that includes the Vice President and the President on down.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Monday, at the first meeting of the U.S.-China cyber working group, we raised directly our concerns with respect to the theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, and confidential business information for economic gain.\xc2\xa0 And we stressed the need to address these concerns, including through the working group, and are continuing to discuss these issues at the Strategic and Economic Dialogue.</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout of a specific conversation that the Vice President may have had, but this is certainly an issue that we are addressing with the Chinese, among many issues that we are addressing with the Chinese during this dialogue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this issue becoming easier or more difficult to negotiate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a way to qualify it.\xc2\xa0 I think that this is an issue that we consistently raise with the Chinese, we express our concerns, and we urge that the steps be taken that I just laid out.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to engage with them, as we engage with them on a number of issues.\xc2\xa0 As you know from the reporting on and the information provided about the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, this is a meeting and a series of meetings that encompasses a number of issues, not just cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 But cybersecurity is one of them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the steps taken on the farm bill, could you talk about that?\xc2\xa0 And CBC is protesting on the floor about that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We obviously have been concerned about the failure of Congress to act on the farm bill the President put forward, a long-term proposal here that -- and the Senate passed, I believe -- and we want progress to be made on the farm bill.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific reaction at this time to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But SNAP is a nutrition assistance program --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand, and we obviously support SNAP.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes that Congress needs to act, and he has put forward a proposal that is long term, and he supports the Senate measure -- is that correct?\xc2\xa0 And we want to see action on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go.\xc2\xa0 I think time was called a long time ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick one on the event in the Bronx today.\xc2\xa0 Derek Jeter is donning the pinstripes.\xc2\xa0 Your personal thoughts?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as a Red Sox fan --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I ask.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- as well as a Nationals fan, I can say that I have enormous regard for Derek Jeter.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a true professional and a class act.\xc2\xa0 And I hope he does well -- just not well enough for the Yankees to catch up to the Red Sox.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:59 P.M.
