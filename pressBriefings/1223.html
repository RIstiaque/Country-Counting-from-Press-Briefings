EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s going on?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you talk to the President at all about how he felt about the speech last night?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think -- look, he felt good about it.\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously he spent a lot of time, obviously, over the last several weeks thinking about this, thinking about the stories that he wanted to tell about the people that we\xe2\x80\x99ve met in our travels across the country.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s given a lot of thought to it.\xc2\xa0 And I think he was very pleased with the way it went last night, because I think fundamentally it tells the story of our future and the challenges that a global economy gives us, but most importantly, to remind ourselves that America has, for 200 years, risen to any number of global challenges, and if we take some important steps to innovate, to build, to educate, to reform, we will continue to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, last night you issued a statement calling on the Egyptian authorities to allow peaceful assembly.\xc2\xa0 Today, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, they\xe2\x80\x99ve banned gatherings and they\xe2\x80\x99ve cracked down on Twitter and Facebook.\xc2\xa0 What is your response to that?\xc2\xa0 And my second question is, do you still back Hosni Mubarak?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously we are monitoring quite closely the situation in Egypt and continue to do so, obviously, in Tunisia.\xc2\xa0 You heard the President speak about universal rights last night in the State of the Union.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe, first and foremost, that any of the parties -- all of the parties should refrain from violence.\xc2\xa0 We support, as the President mentioned last night about the people of Tunisia, the universal rights of the people of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And this is an important time for the government to demonstrate its responsiveness to the people of Egypt in recognizing those universal rights.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to monitor the situation.\xc2\xa0 I got a couple updates very early this morning, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get more as we go along the day.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you believe they should lift the ban on protests?\xc2\xa0 Should they allow these demonstrations to go ahead as long as they\xe2\x80\x99re peaceful?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, yes, we are supportive of the universal right for assembly and speech.\xc2\xa0 Those are universal values.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we would stress quite clearly, for all involved, that expression should be free of violence.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re working with -- obviously we have a close and important ally in Egypt and they will continue to be.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as you stand today, you still back President Mubarak?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Egypt is a strong ally.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President talked about working with Republicans and Republicans working with him on Social Security, overhauling the tax code.\xc2\xa0 How does that happen without him taking a more direct role in inviting them to the table, telling them where and when to show up?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jackie, I think that many of the next months will be spent discussing and hearing the ideas of both parties on those issues.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has said many times that the hallmark of good ideas is [not] the province of one party.\xc2\xa0 So, look, we\xe2\x80\x99re anxious to sit down and walk through spending, strengthening Social Security, corporate and individual tax reform, education reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think many -- almost all the issues the President laid out last night in many ways demand a bipartisan solution.\xc2\xa0 Shared government demands bipartisan solutions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what we want to see both sides be involved in is that important conversation, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see more and more of that as we go on throughout the year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What broad tax deductions are you looking at, though, in order to lower the corporate tax rate?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, look, I think the President discussed last night some broad concepts of ridding the corporate tax code of special interest loopholes, and by doing so, coming up with a corporate tax code that is reduced and fair.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to, again, start the exact bargaining on that.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, this will be a meaningful process and a discussion that the President and Republicans and Democrats alike will have as we move forward on these issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to reiterate -- we all know it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s important to reiterate, as the President said last night, bills won\xe2\x80\x99t land on his desk without the support of both parties.\xc2\xa0 And if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make progress like we did in December during the end of the legislative session, we did that because we worked together.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to do moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On this issue of government reorganization, he laid out some examples of inefficiencies, his salmon joke.\xc2\xa0 But I guess -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a good joke -- (laughter) -- what does that process look like moving forward to try to identify changes that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make?\xc2\xa0 And does he have any ideas that you guys can tell us right now about changes we\xe2\x80\x99ll see?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this, I think the President is very open to, as you heard him talk about, some substantive and structural changes.\xc2\xa0 As he said, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time since we reoriented the structure of our government to meet the challenges that we face today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there have already been discussions in leading up to the State of the Union about how this would look.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to identify people inside the executive branch, inside the executive office of the President as well, that would begin to think through how do we, as you heard the President say, reduce duplication, how do we prioritize.\xc2\xa0 He talked about the overlap on trade issues and export issues.\xc2\xa0 How do we reduce that duplication and prioritize what we know is going to be important for our continued economic growth going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of working through setting up a structure -- beginning to set up a structure that would start to go through this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And obviously a lot of this is going to require ultimately some congressional action, the authority to pursue executive reorganization.\xc2\xa0 But I think given the fiscal times that we\xe2\x80\x99re in, this makes a lot of sense right now -- not just to meet the challenges but in understanding that we all agree that we are going to have to cut the amount of money government spends.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be leading the process out of the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still some discussions internally, but they\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of figuring out --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So ultimately he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a very detailed sort of blueprint for how he thinks government --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we will begin a larger process of how one comes about the thoughts and theories of reorganizing a government for the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What would be the timetable for putting something out?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would be ahead of the process if I had that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Largely absent from last night\xe2\x80\x99s speech was any mention of specifically gun control issues.\xc2\xa0 When will the President start talking about this?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said that he\xe2\x80\x99s looking at proposals on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 But can you update us on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me say two things.\xc2\xa0 I think, one, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that there are a host of issues that didn\xe2\x80\x99t receive billing in the State of the Union that will still encompass a decent amount of time inside the administration in 2011.\xc2\xa0 So first and foremost, simply because something didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a half page in the State of the Union, or a paragraph or such, I think doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean that it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that people will work on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That having been said, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that at some point the President talks about the issues surrounding gun violence.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timetable or obviously what he would say, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule that out in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the best opportunity he\xe2\x80\x99s got all year long, and it came on the heels of -- when memories of Arizona are fresh?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously what happened in Arizona was a tragedy.\xc2\xa0 But, Jackie, it\xe2\x80\x99s happened to school kids in Chicago.\xc2\xa0 It happens in many places all over the country.\xc2\xa0 So, again, what the President wanted to do last night was outline the global economic challenges that we face in a way that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to do in a while.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also Paul Broun, a Republican from Georgia last night, tweeted during the State of the Union that -- accusing the President of not believing in the Constitution, also not -- and also believing in socialism.\xc2\xa0 What does it say about the call for civility last night that the President was calling for?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I think we will be judged going forward on our ability to sit down and work together on not just sitting near each other or next to each other for an evening, but whether or not today we can get about the process of -- and for the next year -- getting about the process of finding some concrete solutions to the problems that we know we face.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to visit a few companies today in Manitowoc that are meeting many of these challenges.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re competing for -- they\xe2\x80\x99re competing against the world in clean energy manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re hiring.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re investing.\xc2\xa0 And I think all of that is -- all of that is what we should spend our time thinking about and worrying about and, quite frankly, the bulk of our time working together to address.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is today\xe2\x80\x99s stop similar to what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see as you guys ramp up the campaign?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously going to be talking about some of the proposals from last night.\xc2\xa0 But it seems like a lot of the trip today is also focused on touting some of the policies from the past two years.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I mean, first and foremost, and we talked a little bit about this yesterday, had the tax agreement in December not included the hundred percent investing provision and the payroll tax cut, I think they would have been very good candidates to hear very early in the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 In fact, when we rolled out the investing stuff I think in September, most people thought that was a 2011 -- that that\xe2\x80\x99s the next time it would get taken up.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously had spent time thinking about a payroll tax cut in the late summer as well.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, first and foremost, though not part of the State of the Union, the important economic proposals that are now law -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll see companies today that will take advantage this year.\xc2\xa0 And there will be companies throughout the country that will take advantage this year, using some of the cash that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about on the sidelines to invest in growing their businesses.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the payroll tax cut has already started to put money back into people\xe2\x80\x99s pockets, which is tremendously important.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think what the President wants to do today is highlight steps that these companies and other companies are taking.\xc2\xa0 I think as the President talks about building, as the President talks about education on trips in the next several weeks, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him -- you will see him highlight different -- as he did last night -- different stories around the country that help highlight some of the important things that are happening all over this country and throughout the states to meet and address these challenges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following on Jackie\xe2\x80\x99s question, is there some sense of a timeline for the administration to start talking to Republicans about this corporate tax overhaul?\xc2\xa0 Can you give any sense?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- let me see if there are -- let me see if there\xe2\x80\x99s a Geithner or a Jack Lew thing happening in the interim.\xc2\xa0 Let me check and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything specific on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President any closer to finding your replacement and springing you?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cFree Robert Gibbs.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 No, I anticipate that the President is actually quite close in that.\xc2\xa0 And I anticipate that I will, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, probably leave around sometime in mid-February.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- this week --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Could be.\xc2\xa0 I have not been told that, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer.\xc2\xa0 But my anticipation is that it won\xe2\x80\x99t be long.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he knows who it is?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just a --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if, honestly, he has made a final decision on that.\xc2\xa0 And I anticipate, obviously, over the course of the next few days I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll likely see final decisions that will be made on a lot of the -- finishing up the restructuring that began, quite honestly, probably back in September and October with Pete working through the President on what the administration would look like as people decided to go back to what they might have been doing before.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be a Carol Browner replacement?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to -- I mean, I talked to Carol a little bit yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I think -- and, look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that the President rolled out an extremely robust energy agenda last night -- cutting oil subsidies or subsidies to oil companies to invest in clean energy and research and development, and an energy standard that doubles the amount of our electricity produced by renewable energy or clean energy by 2035.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A little different in that was -- and we sort of sometimes get stuck in these debates, well, is it -- are you going to do solar and wind to do that, or are you going to do nuclear and clean coal to do that?\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief is with a challenge as enormous as our energy independence, that the only way we\xe2\x80\x99re going to meet that challenge is to do both, to do all of it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what the structure of her office is going to look like, but I can assure you that regardless of the staffing inside the White House, first and foremost the President is committed to continuing our important investments in the innovation around clean energy manufacturing and in addressing the long-term problems and the continual -- our continual increase in our dependence on energy sources in other places in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to meet the challenges that we have with China and India as they invest more and more heavily in clean energy without a plan of our own, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see some of that highlighted, quite honestly, on our trip today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to give you a -- we are obviously cognizant of the weather in Washington and if anything changes about departure or what have you, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\xc2\xa0 But we still, knock on wood, believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back through to Andrews Air Force Base and the weather will hopefully not be too bad.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just had one quick question about the South American trip.\xc2\xa0 Can you outline the President\xe2\x80\x99s goals on that trip?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think as he said last night, this is a -- historically, it\xe2\x80\x99s the anniversary of the Kennedy Alliance for Progress.\xc2\xa0 It is an enormously important part of the world that we have yet to have an opportunity to have the President spent time in.\xc2\xa0 It would be his first trip to South America and --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 His first trip personally as well?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It will -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a very important part of the world.\xc2\xa0 Obviously a place like Brazil has addressed some of their energy challenges.\xc2\xa0 They have a growing economy.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President believes that it is important for him to get to South America and Central America personally next year and strengthen, as we have in Asia and in Europe, strengthen our ties to that very important region of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right?\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0END</p>\n<p>\n\t11:04 A.M.
