Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t3:18 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: Thanks, everyone. Sorry we\'re late. This briefing is, as I think was indicated in the guidance, on the record, not embargoed. The purpose of it is, as you know, the President -- or the Vice President is heading up to the Hill with Bill Daley and Jack Lew, the OMB Director, to have the first meeting with the House and Senate leadership -- bipartisan, bicameral -- on the budget discussions. And when Jay was up here yesterday there were a lot of questions about the underlying math involving how we\'re approaching this discussion, what\xe2\x80\x99s been cut, what do we propose cutting. So we wanted to bring Gene in here today to help walk you guys through that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe basic gist of this is, as we had talked about, the President believes that given our fiscal environment, we need to cut spending; he proposed in the 2012 budgets a five-year non-defense discretionary spending freeze, which cuts $400 billion and gets us to the lowest level since Eisenhower. So we need to do that. But we also need to make sure we do it in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sacrifice our capacity to win the future by out-educating, out-innovating, and out-building the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the discussions we\'re going to have with the Republicans, that\'s the framework we take going into it. We have, by their measure -- and Gene will explain how this math works -- by their measure, we have already done reduction in spending of $45 billion. We have proposed and we\'ve talked about doing more. So we\'ve essentially met them halfway by their measure. And so that\'s a starting point for this discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe recognize that in this debate both sides are not going to get everything they want. Just like in the tax cut debate in December, both sides are going to have to give to resolve this. We\'re willing to do that. We\'re willing to cut things that in a different fiscal environment we would either maintain, fund, or even expand funding. So we understand that. As you know, we have talked about our opposition to the original House bill that passed, H.R. 1, because we believe that while we agree with Republicans that we need to cut spending, we believe that it goes too far in cutting some of the things that we believe are critical to winning the future -- education, innovation, research and development.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we go into this knowing we\'re going to have to cut, we know we\'re going to have to compromise with them. I\'m sure there will be a lot of questions about the meeting. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet so our ability to answer those will be limited. And we\'re not going to talk even after the meeting a lot about what happens in there because we want this to be a good-faith discussion with both parties.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I\'ll turn it over to Gene.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: Thank you. So as Dan said, the President and the administration is prepared to put forward the specific cuts that will show that we are -- have moved halfway to the Republican House bill, and that we are willing to cut spending further if we can agree on cuts and find common ground in a way that does not do harm to the economy in the short term or in the long term through gutting education, research, innovation -- things that are critical to winning our economic future.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me just explain -- and we\'ll give you -- I will give you the specific numbers and we can come back over them as much as you want. Basically --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Do you have a blackboard?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: What?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ A blackboard would help.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: Sure. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Austan? (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, essentially, as Republican leadership has made clear, they reduce spending -- when they talk about reducing spending over a $100 billion, what they are referring to is that H.R. 1 came in $102.3 billion lower than the President\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal 2011 request. That\'s for all discretionary spending. So they came in at $102.3 billion lower than the President\xe2\x80\x99s request.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you\xe2\x80\x99d like to -- if you so like, I can give you the exact numbers on that, or we\xe2\x80\x99ll do so in a second.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt that point, the President, however, has agreed to a CR that would be $40.8 billion below what the President\xe2\x80\x99s 2011 request was.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ $40.8 billion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: $40.8 billion -- that was $40.8 billion. So when the CR -- the CR itself moved -- the March 4 CR moved $40.8 billion towards where the -- towards H.R. 1. Then the two-week CR on March 18th moved another $4 billion to $44.8 billion. So in other words, the gap, again, between the President\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal year 2011 request and where H.R. 1 was, was $102.3 billion. Of that $102.3 billion difference, we have already moved $44.8 billion to closing that gap -- almost halfway.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are also prepared to put out specifics that will move another over $6 billion closer -- so that we will have met them halfway -- essentially split the difference between the President\xe2\x80\x99s request and H.R. 1. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that we are willing to cut spending further if we can find common ground on cuts that we can all agree would help reduce the deficit without harming the economy in the short term or harming our long-term competitiveness.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, just to give you then the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ -- $6 billion in new cuts that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to put out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: Stay tuned. But we\xe2\x80\x99re making clear that we are willing to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: And this is, as Jay talked about from the podium the other day, we were willing in the course of extending funding for the government to do $8 billion over a month, and so this is in line with that. Essentially we\xe2\x80\x99ve already talked about -- and we have for a few days -- our willingness to go -- already go halfway to the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 $100 billion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Gene, what was the FY \xe2\x80\x9911 request that you\xe2\x80\x99re wheedling down?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SPERLING: Sure. The President\xe2\x80\x99s 2011 request -- and this includes everything -- defense, security, foreign operations as well as non-security -- was $1.1283 [trillion] -- $1.128 --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Trillion.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: -- trillion. H.R.1 was $1.026 [trillion]. So if you wrote that down right, it\xe2\x80\x99s essentially $1.128 [trillion]. Take off $100 [billion] to $1.028 [trillion]. Take off another $2.3 [billion] and you\xe2\x80\x99re at $1.026 [trillion]. So that\'s the $102.3 billion difference.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the CR passed, it passed -- that extended the budget -- extended CR for two weeks, March 18th -- it went to $1.0835 [trillion] -- $1.0835 [trillion]. So that is where you get us moving $44.8 billion of the way. And we\xe2\x80\x99re already committed that we will move the additional $6.5 billion in specifics that will make clear that we can get to half -- meet them halfway.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have not put those out yet, but we\xe2\x80\x99re making a commitment. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to doing that and that we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to cut further if we can find common ground on a budget that we think reduces spending in the right way while protecting our investments in education, innovation and research.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Just real quick, yesterday with Jay, I thought it was $4 billion and then $4 billion, and now you guys are saying $4 billion plus $6.5 billion? So we\xe2\x80\x99ve just gone up $2.5 billion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: We are making clear that we are willing to go $6.5 billion -- it would be $2.5 above --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Yesterday. Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ But you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to say what any of those are today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: I am not going to say what any of those are right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Are you providing --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Why not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: I would say -- I\xe2\x80\x99d just say stay tuned.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ What is your --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Can you just explain --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say whether we\xe2\x80\x99re putting -- I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that we are committed to doing that, and I would just say stay tuned.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Have you determined what they are and you\xe2\x80\x99re just not telling us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: I\xe2\x80\x99d just say stay tuned.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Gene, can you talk about the prior cuts? Can you talk about the prior cuts? Because many in the GOP are saying that you have not detailed. They want to know what the cuts are. They don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: We have detailed those. I mean, Gene can walk you through them in great detail. But the important thing, though, is to understand the basic math here, which is under their $100 billion number -- it\xe2\x80\x99s their number and their measurement of how they got to $100 billion -- as Gene explained, we\xe2\x80\x99re already -- the current CR level before the one the President signed yesterday has $41 [billion] under. We\xe2\x80\x99ve done an additional $4 [billion].</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the basic point to what Gene is saying is, what we have said is we basically are willing to -- just before the negotiations even start, we\xe2\x80\x99ve already come basically halfway. But this is the beginning of the process and that process begins in about 30 minutes up on the Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ What is your number that is comparable to their $61 billion that they actually passed, which actually cuts current spending levels, and not the 2011 request, which was never enacted? What is your comparable number to $61 [billion]?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ It\xe2\x80\x99s $10.5 [billion].</p>\n<p>\n\tQ $4 [billion] plus $6.5 [billion] if you do it. You\xe2\x80\x99ve cut one-sixth of what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done in cutting it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: No, just a sec, can I say something?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ They\xe2\x80\x99re now projecting --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: No, no, no, no -- no, no --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ -- they\xe2\x80\x99re saying, okay, you caught us --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: No, no, no, no --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ -- it\xe2\x80\x99s really $61 [billion].</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: No, but actually --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ And they\xe2\x80\x99re backing off and they\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: Actually -- no, no, no, no. Actually, first of all, this was the standard that they had put forward, the measurement they put forward the whole time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ By mistake and they\xe2\x80\x99ve now admitted that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: No, no, no, no. I mean, before -- hold on, just a second --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ They are, they\xe2\x80\x99re now admitting it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: Just a second. Before you just be that simple about it, you should make sure you understand the way things usually are. Normally for every single time any of us have ever been here, done any of these budgets ever, you take a budget and you make an adjustment for inflation going forward. And if you cut below that, you are cutting actual services because inflation and population goes up every year. Okay? So when you\xe2\x80\x99re doing a CR that\xe2\x80\x99s $40 billion below, off of a $1 trillion base, you are doing fairly significant cuts as any of us would have every measured them.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso, understand the way there\xe2\x80\x99s $40.8 billion above, which was that there was about $30 billion of this was that the President requested more in defense and security and foreign operations than where the CR was.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe CR actually takes down from the last year about $10 billion more in taking money out from the census, from agriculture programs, long-time savings from the crime victim program. So I would not be -- much of this $40 billion below would represent a significant amount if it would represent cuts by any standard that has ever been used in Washington in terms of budgets. So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it should be -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s quite so simple.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Well, we were told by people in the White House that the $100 billion was a fake number. And now you guys are saying, oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a real number, because only by using $100 billion --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: Hold on, just a second. Just a second.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ -- can you get $41 billion.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: If you have a negotiation and one side -- this is the President of the United States -- he puts forward a request. The request was a hard freeze, meaning not even a normal freeze -- normal freeze means with inflation -- but a hard freeze, in which you\xe2\x80\x99re essentially cutting below, doing a real cut -- the President proposes that for non-security. Then they come in $102 billion below that. And you\xe2\x80\x99re having -- what you\xe2\x80\x99re having here is a negotiation about how you reach common ground, how you reach compromise. And we had a $102 billion difference between us.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that we -- that the White House has been willing to move halfway to where they are. Now, when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a negotiation and compromise, that\xe2\x80\x99s very important.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the idea that these things are not kind of real, I mean, if you want to -- the President -- just think about the following. The President had a freeze. That freeze contained a lot of cuts. It also called for increases in things we thought were very important. Those are being -- in agreeing to the CR, that\xe2\x80\x99s seeing $226 million less for national service, $1 billion less for NIH, $912 million less for Social Security Administration dealing with backlogs, et cetera. So the idea this is not real could not be further from the truth.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President, again --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying initially we were told the $100 billion was a fake number by people here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: I think there was discussion before about when people were annualizing numbers. But I\xe2\x80\x99m giving you -- but this is the purpose of doing this. I\xe2\x80\x99m giving you what the President\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal year 2011 request is. I\xe2\x80\x99m giving you what H.R.1 is -- those are the President\xe2\x80\x99s requests, and their preferred position -- and then telling you that we moved nearly halfway and are willing in the near future to move completely halfway and that we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to move more. That is very important in understanding the effort to reach common ground here.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then of the $40 billion and the -- significant amounts of those are cuts in real terms that will have a serious effect on benefits and services in areas that matter to people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Can I follow up, since I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked the first question? Mark Zandi, Goldman Sachs, estimated that the bill passed by House Republicans would cost 700,000 jobs. How many jobs would the package you\xe2\x80\x99re proposing cost?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: We have not tried to -- we as an administration have not tried --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that follow -- it would meet them halfway at 350,000 -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not quite. It\xe2\x80\x99s more like 300,000.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: Look, we have tried to put forward -- we have put forward from the beginning an economic strategy. And we put forward things that we thought were very important to the economy in the December package. It was the administration who put it on the table, having 100 percent expensing, which has made a very significant impact in companies accelerating investment in this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe put on the table and helped pass a $112 billion payroll tax cut that, with higher gas prices, has proven even more important to this economy. That extra $80 a month in the paychecks of families making $50,000 means that people have more to spend than they would have, even with higher gas prices. All of these things are important.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe felt that in light of those things that we are doing to strengthen the economy, starting the process of doing significant spending cuts because of the benefits that would get to long-term fiscal discipline were part of an economic strategy that would be good for growth now and good for confidence and growth going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt some level if you start to cut too deep it becomes harmful. It has not just risks in the short term but it also has risks in the long term. We are, as the President said in the State of the Union, competing with countries that are doing significantly more on modernizing their infrastructure, on research, on investing in clean energy. These are things that we hear from CEOs, Democrat and Republicans, are critical for competitiveness.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo our focus is, yes, not on cutting so deep that you would have a negative impact on jobs and growth now, but our focus is also on the cutting the type of things that hurt our ability to win the future by ensuring that we can compete in terms of education, skills, modern infrastructure and innovation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ How far are you willing to go?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ The additional cuts that you say that you\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to agree to, are those all in the area of discretionary spending?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: I\xe2\x80\x99m making clear today that we are willing to meet them halfway and are willing to put out the cuts to do that. And we have to give a chance for the first meeting to happen at 4:00 p.m. So, again, stay tuned. At some point in the near future, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ You said repeatedly you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to meet them halfway, and just a minute ago you said you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to -- it sounds like you said further than halfway. So I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure out what is the large number --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SPERLING: So what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is, is that we pointed out that there is a $102.3 billion difference between us to start; that with the CR we had already moved nearly halfway, $44.8 [billion]. And we\xe2\x80\x99re making clear now that we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to move so that it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly halfway.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that that\'s the end. We\xe2\x80\x99re making clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re still willing to negotiate, to try to find common ground and compromise because of the importance of ensuring that we have both a budget that can restrain spending and still make sure we can invest in the future, but also because it\xe2\x80\x99s important for confidence for the public and the world to not see us in a position where we have to come back repeatedly two weeks after two weeks to keep our government open.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ A simple follow-up. What is the total number? Is it $44.8 [billion] plus $6.5 [billion]?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: I mean, you can figure out halfway between zero and a $102.3 billion, so it\xe2\x80\x99s there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ So I think the dispute over meeting halfway has to do with the fact that you guys are counting the President\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal year 2011 budget that was never enacted, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re not counting that. They\xe2\x80\x99re counting that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ They\xe2\x80\x99re not counting that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: Anymore.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ They\xe2\x80\x99re not counting it anymore. They\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the $61 billion in cuts are based on the current spending levels; $100 billion would be what President Obama proposed in 2011, but that was never enacted. Therefore, it\xe2\x80\x99s $60 billion. So there\xe2\x80\x99s this $40 billion that was never formally proposed that you guys are taking credit for as a cut that never actually happened.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: What we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is using -- I understand that maybe people want to change the math now, but -- here\xe2\x80\x99s the point, the overall point we\xe2\x80\x99re making is we want to explain why we feel we\xe2\x80\x99ve come halfway. We\xe2\x80\x99ve done that. I understand that maybe some of the people who originally decided to use that math may not want to use it anymore.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we wanted to give some detail to why that is the case. What is clear no matter what math you use is that if and when we resolve this, it will be done in a way in which Republicans won\xe2\x80\x99t get everything they want and Democrats and President Obama won\xe2\x80\x99t get everything they want. And so the discussion of how we get there begins today.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what the number is, what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to arrive on. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to sit and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk about that. And that will happen in 15 minutes or whatever time that is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ But I guess the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 point is you guys are taking credit for -- in that halfway point, you\xe2\x80\x99re taking credit for $40 billion that were phantom cuts that never happened.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: I think if you go back and look at the press releases that were put out the day the House CR passed -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not the ones taking credit for that. There are innumerable quotes, many of them in stories and papers that you guys did on that day, which say that they cut -- with Republican leadership saying they cut $100 billion on the day.</p>\n<p>\n\tBy that measure, we have come halfway. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have -- we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to talk to them about all the math involved in this, but the very simple fact is they say their CR cut $100 billion. Under that measure, we have already come halfway.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we recognize -- and we want to explain the math so you guys understand our thinking on this going into the meeting. But what is clear is we\xe2\x80\x99re at the beginning of a process of discussing this. They\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get everything they want; we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get everything we want. And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to discuss how we get there, much like we did in the tax cut deal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ I know ABC News, when we covered it, we covered it as $61 billion, not $100 billion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Yes, us, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ We didn\xe2\x80\x99t. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ And I\xe2\x80\x99m glad CBS followed our lead. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: However, Jake, while that might have been a number that goes from the CR, it\xe2\x80\x99s not accurate to say that that is necessarily the cut number, because, as I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, when people talk about savings, when you freeze year after year, you are saving money because you are changing a baseline that assumes you\xe2\x80\x99re going up.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is not right to kind of suggest, if you want to -- even if you want to do just pure spending cuts, it is going to be a higher number than you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about because the non-security spending that\xe2\x80\x99s in the CR is actually about $10 billion lower than what passed in fiscal year 2010. And then also, you would normally say that if you froze at that level, that would also bring money down, and so now you\xe2\x80\x99re adding another $4 [billion] and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about going further.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are different numbers that are accurate in what they describe. What you\xe2\x80\x99re describing is what\xe2\x80\x99s below a CR. It does not reflect -- but the other thing I wanted to just remind you of is, their thing hasn\xe2\x80\x99t passed into law either. Right?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Right.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: This is the President of the United States has put forward a request that\xe2\x80\x99s his ideal budget that he put forward. They put forward their ideal proposal, something they could pass in the House but -- and there is $102.3 billion difference there. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, when you\xe2\x80\x99re covering any type of negotiations, that\xe2\x80\x99s not highly relevant to know where the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal was, where their proposal was, and then if there\xe2\x80\x99s movement, to what degree is that splitting the difference or moving towards one side or another. So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a totally legitimate, important thing in covering a negotiation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House role going to be now in this negotiation? Are you bargaining with the GOP? Are the Democratic leaders bargaining?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: We\xe2\x80\x99re all at the table together.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ And the Democrats have their ducks in a row?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: Of course. (Laughter.) I mean, the point is, we have been having conversations with Democrats throughout this process, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having conversations with Republicans throughout this process. We\xe2\x80\x99re sitting at the table. And what has to be figured out is what is the best package for the country and what can -- and whether that is something that can make it through a Democratic Senate or Republican House. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re all at the table together. The Vice President has called the first meeting with the bicameral, bipartisan leadership with Jack Lew and Bill Daley, and those conversations will continue after this meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ What is the White House position on the riders that are accompanying the House CR, including among others, the one that defunds Planned Parenthood? Are those a nonstarter as well for this administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: We think the focus should be on how to cut spending in a way that is smart for the economy in the short term and the long term, and that no one should get that core mission derailed by focusing on any political or ideological side matters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ So you want those stripped from the final language?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: We\xe2\x80\x99ve already -- on all of those, both when the bill passed and in previous conversations around these same issues and other legislative vehicles, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about opposition to those. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have the first meeting before we begin laying out what we are and what we aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to do. So that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to them and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them what you said. We can negotiate through me.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make it to the meeting you\xe2\x80\x99re probably going to have to leave now. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Gene, you said you\xe2\x80\x99d like to have -- find more common ground in addition to the offer that you\xe2\x80\x99re putting out now. Can you give us a flavor for areas where you think common ground might be found? And separately, do you expect the debt ceiling to be on the table or an issue that you will discuss in these talks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge what will happen in the conversations. But I think most would agree that the immediate issue that we face is finding compromise and common ground on the budget in a way that cuts spending, protects our economic future, and can allow us to show that our government is funded within our means through the end of this fiscal year. That\xe2\x80\x99s got to be the number one objective, most immediate objective going into the negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ And the debt ceiling at another time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: I just, again, don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be talked about in a conversation that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t started yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Gene, is the argument that you laid out for us about \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve met them halfway\xe2\x80\x9d the same thing that the Vice President and the others from the administration will be telling Republicans when the meeting starts? Is that what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to present as the opening position? And also, could you just address, since Vice President Biden is going out of the country on Sunday, is he still planning on trying to manage this from afar, or is Bill Daley going to sort of take the lead? Just if you could talk a little bit about that process.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: Well, again, we have to see how the first meeting goes. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that our entire budget team stands ready to talk, negotiate, work non-stop starting now to get this done within the two-week CR, if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible. And there\xe2\x80\x99s -- from our side, we will have a very strong budget team available to talk, negotiate, work any time, day or night, as long as others are willing to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Is that your opening position what you -- will the administration lay that out at the table, what you just told us? In other words, is this for press consumption, or is this what you\xe2\x80\x99re actually bring to the table, this idea of meeting you halfway?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: This is where we as the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: Only press is here, so --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: This is where we as an administration are at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: The driving behind this briefing was the fact that when Jay has this conversation, and Amy and Jen and others had this conversation with you guys since the briefing yesterday, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of confusion, and there\xe2\x80\x99s been some debate publicly about the numbers. And so we wanted to bring that forward. That\xe2\x80\x99s been our position publicly before a meeting was scheduled or even proposed, in terms of how far we\xe2\x80\x99ve come already and our willingness to do more.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have to link it. This is to help make your life easier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Well, the reason why I ask is because the -- we have -- probably several of us in this room have had strong pushback from the Republican leadership about this idea of meeting halfway; they reject that. And so I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering whether this is something that the Vice President and others are going to make a case directly to those leaders that you believe that you have met them halfway, or if this is just for our little bantering back and forth.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to pre-characterize what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be said in a meeting that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken place yet. I think that, as Dan said, the purpose here is that there are specific numbers behind this and we\xe2\x80\x99re just explaining to you, because there\xe2\x80\x99s been different types of numbers thrown out, what our 2011 request is, what their ideal position is, and why where we are right now is halfway between that. That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty straight factual and numerical issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Gene, it seems like you\xe2\x80\x99ve left the door open for further cuts. Can you explain why, if you really met them halfway, why are you saying we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep discussing it? If you really met someone halfway on a compromise, usually you stop negotiating. Can you talk about why, if you\xe2\x80\x99re halfway, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep talking to them about more cuts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: Simply because we understand we have to do everything we can to reach common ground and compromise to help reduce spending, keep our investments in our future strong in a way that can allow us, even with divided government, to work together to keep our government open. So nobody can come to these conversations with -- no one, including us, can come to these conversations with a \xe2\x80\x9cmy way or the highway\xe2\x80\x9d position.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so while we have moved halfway to them, we feel that the right posture we should take is to still be open to finding cuts that we think are agreeable, that further reduce the deficit, and that meet our standards for not going too far in hurting the investments in education and research and innovation that we think are critical for our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Gene, I understand that you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to tell us what you\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to cut for that $6.5 billion, but are you going to tell the Republicans what you\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to cut? And if so, are you going to tell them today or wait until later?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: I\xe2\x80\x99d just, again, say stay tuned. I think trying to let you know kind of what our plans are in a way that will --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ I mean, why not tell them now if you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to meet them halfway.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ If you tell them, they\xe2\x80\x99ll tell us, so you may as well tell us. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Or just open the meeting to us.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: That\xe2\x80\x99s another way you could do things -- not maybe the best way, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ But, I mean, really, if you are trying to meet them halfway, if they\xe2\x80\x99ve told you what they\xe2\x80\x99ll cut --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: We\xe2\x80\x99re making clear that we are willing right now to go there. And as to the exact timing of when we would do that and everything, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d just say stay tuned.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Just to your point of \xe2\x80\x9cmy way or the highway\xe2\x80\x9d is not your approach, but one Republican source is telling us, \xe2\x80\x9cIf that\xe2\x80\x99s what they bring to this meeting, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a long one\xe2\x80\x9d -- talking about the halfway math. So if they\xe2\x80\x99re pushing back like this already, is there more than just that argument that you need to make?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand this is going to be -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to solve this problem by 5:00 p.m. today. There\xe2\x80\x99s going to be multiple discussions on this. What we\xe2\x80\x99re -- when we sit down with them, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go through and figure where there\xe2\x80\x99s additional common ground. Of some of the cuts that were made in this recent CR are things that were in H.R.1 and also in the President\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 budget we rolled out a few weeks ago where we were willing to accelerate some of those cuts into this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re going to look for common ground. I think that we -- while there may be some disputes on math and some other things heading into this, we remain optimistic we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to get this done for a couple of reasons. One, we\xe2\x80\x99ve proven we can do this before. In December, before we had the first conversations with the Republicans and the Democrats on the tax cut deal, the general consensus was that we were never going to get a deal like the one we did. And we got it done. And so there is a belief that we can work together and if we can work together, find common ground and all come into this with an open mind.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then second, I think everyone acknowledges that we are in a -- at the state of the recovery we are in right now, it is important that people put political agendas aside, ideological agendas aside, and be willing to give in some of their core -- be willing to give some ground in order to get this done so that we are not putting our economic recovery and economic certainty at risk by playing politics with this.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there -- we believe we can get this done. We\xe2\x80\x99re having the first meeting. I don\'t want to be -- no one can tell you when it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get done or what the process is going to be, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to sit down at the table, Republicans and Democrats, talking about the best way to move forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ I just want to follow up on the jobs discussion that Mike and Jake and some others were pursuing earlier. Do you acknowledge that whatever compromise that\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat more than halfway you reach with them will have a negative impact on jobs and the economy, just it will be less bad than it would be otherwise? Or do you think there is some way to thread the needle and achieve a level of cuts on the scale that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about that would not harm job creation and the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: I think those are all good questions, but I think you\xe2\x80\x99re basically asking me to try to kind of say where we think our bottom lines are, et cetera. And I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to obviously negotiate here.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that when you\xe2\x80\x99re doing -- when you\xe2\x80\x99re putting together an economic strategy, you have to find the right balance. We had a strategy of putting together measures like 100 percent expensing and the payroll tax cut that helped give additional momentum in the economy. We feel a reasonable amount of spending reduction can have benefits in terms of confidence that we are going to live within our means and get our fiscal house in order.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnything can go too far. And at some level, the negatives in terms of jobs and growth outweigh the positives you get in economic confidence, and we think everybody should take that very seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I just -- just on spending reductions, I know you hear the President say this all the time but it\xe2\x80\x99s worth just digesting a second what it means -- when you look at the fact that we say spending as a percentage of our economy is going to be at the lowest levels since Eisenhower, what we\xe2\x80\x99re saying is that the path the President was on -- even before these reductions -- was going to take non-security spending to 2.1 percent by 2015. We can\xe2\x80\x99t find another time -- going back all the way back to when records were kept, which was Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s first year -- where it was ever that low.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what that means is that by any historical standard with the cuts the President has, non-security spending is actually low historically -- lower than any of the four years where we had surpluses. So the President has put forward even before this started a very tough and stringent spending path for our country to show that we are getting our house in order and living within our means.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is a willingness to do additional spending to find common ground and compromise, but the President has also made very clear that this has to be part of an economic strategy and doing this in a way that would not harm educational opportunity or innovation or research, would not work against the larger goal of creating confidence and growth and future prosperity.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Gene, just to follow up, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying substantially that their premise is correct, that by definition cuts are not anti-stimulative, and, in fact, the confidence benefits could outweigh the narrower loss of spending on particular programs or loss of particular jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the exact level. I think that as part of a balanced package, there is -- there can be confidence benefits in showing that you are starting the path of getting your fiscal house in order. But done too deeply -- which we believe H.R.1 is -- we believe the negative impact for the immediate economy outweighs the benefits, and more importantly, that it would cause reductions in areas that the President -- that top experts, CEOs all believe are critical for us being competitive in creating the good jobs of the future here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFIEFFER: Okay, last one. There you go.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Policy riders aside, are any economic proposals also on the table in addition to spending cuts, such as expedited rescissions or tax proposals or things in a 2012 budget to balance the picture?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SPERLING: I mean, what I\xe2\x80\x99d say is I just -- I don\'t want to, again, prejudge a conversation that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- where the first meeting is starting at 4:00 p.m. Again I think the immediate task in front of us is to find the common ground on additional spending cuts in a way that does not harm our economy in the short term or our prospects for winning the economic future in the long term.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. PFEIFFER: All right, thank you, everyone.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:57 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
