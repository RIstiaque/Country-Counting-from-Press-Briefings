EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the first briefing of April, 2011.\xc2\xa0 Before I get started, I have a statement from the President I would like to read -- from the President:<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xe2\x80\x9cI condemn in the strongest possible terms the attack on the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan today.\xc2\xa0 Together with the American people, I offer my deepest condolences to those injured and killed, as well as to their loved ones.\xc2\xa0 The brave men and women of the United Nations, including the Afghan staff, undertake their work in support of the Afghan people.\xc2\xa0 Their work is essential to building a stronger Afghanistan for the benefit of all its citizens.\xc2\xa0 We stress the importance of calm and urge all parties to reject violence and resolve differences through dialogue.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I have to start the briefing, and I will take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 In Libya, the rebels are apparently talking about the prospect of a ceasefire if Colonel Qaddafi concedes to certain provisions.\xc2\xa0 While there is no sign that Qaddafi would agree to those conditions, including allowing peaceful protests, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering of the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position on that concept.\xc2\xa0 Is it something the President could support -- a ceasefire that would keep Qaddafi in power?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, as you know, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is that Muammar Qaddafi is no longer fit to lead.\xc2\xa0 He has lost legitimacy in the eyes of his people and the world.\xc2\xa0 So, no, it is not his position that Qaddafi should stay in power.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed and tried to make clear, there is the mission undertaken under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, the military mission, which is designed to protect civilians -- protect Libyan civilians from Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces; and then there is the policy of the United States and the efforts undertaken unilaterally and multilaterally that are aimed at pressuring Qaddafi, the Qaddafi regime, and -- in a way that we hope and believe will produce the result of him leaving power.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if the people of Libya decide this is an agreement that they could live with?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the people -- well, okay, let me step back.\xc2\xa0 Of course, the future of Libya should be decided by the Libyans.\xc2\xa0 And that is true -- we believe that the Libyan people do not want -- no longer want Qaddafi to remain in power as the leader of Libya.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about outcomes of potential ceasefires or negotiations.\xc2\xa0 It remains the President\xe2\x80\x99s position that Qaddafi should not lead Libya and that the Libyan people should decide their future.\xc2\xa0 And we support a democratic transition, free and fair elections, and a government that arises out of that process that is responsive to the aspirations of the Libyan people.\xc2\xa0 And that remains our position.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 One question on the budget, pivoting off of some comments the President just had in Landover, sounding somewhat optimistic about being close to a deal, at least on the number to be cut, but the details to be worked out.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any update on where that stands?\xc2\xa0 Is it in fact close to a final deal, or is the sense that this might come down to the deadline of April 8?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The process of negotiating a budget compromise continues.\xc2\xa0 It is a complicated one.\xc2\xa0 And we are engaged in that process.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an appropriations process, the bill itself.\xc2\xa0 So we are -- the House and Senate appropriators are the ones who are actually constructing the pieces.\xc2\xa0 And we are there to advise and assist and consult and engage at the leadership level, as you know we have.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President recently, on Capitol Hill, also speaking with Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Reid.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether we\xe2\x80\x99re -- how close we are I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we have a fairly short window here before this continuing resolution expires.\xc2\xa0 People need to get to work and work diligently to try to find that common ground, to work out the details, so that we can reduce spending, cut spending of $73 billion, the target that both sides have agreed is the target we can reach.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we need to find -- we need to agree on the details of how we get there.\xc2\xa0 And we need to do it in a way, as the President has said, that cuts deeply, but does not cut the very investments that we need to make in education, infrastructure, research and development that will guarantee our success, job creation, and economic growth in the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So a follow-up on the budget, and also another question on Libya.\xc2\xa0 What prompted the President today to sort of speak out so forcefully on the budget, on the budget compromise efforts?\xc2\xa0 And is he basically trying to put the screws on both sides to get something done here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President was speaking on an economic issue today, as you know, about the National Green Fleets Initiative -- a partnership with private businesses, those shipping companies that have large car and truck fleets, and our goal to have -- part of the process that the federal fleets are doing, as well -- of greening those fleets so that we can -- in ways that will help build towards that goal of reducing our dependence on oil and diversifying our -- the sources from which we get our energy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it was an economic speech.\xc2\xa0 He also was very glad to report the encouraging jobs numbers that we received today, the rather strong economic -- rather jobs growth that we got in March -- 230,000 private-sector jobs net; 216,000 total.\xc2\xa0 As the President said, that\'s 13 straight months of job growth, job creation, private sector job creation, for a total of 1.8 million jobs over 13 months.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, a full 1 point drop in the unemployment rate in just four months, which is the steepest decline since 1984.\xc2\xa0 All good news.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not good enough.\xc2\xa0 Rate still too high.\xc2\xa0 But in speaking with him about this yesterday in a meeting, it forces everyone to focus on the fact that we are in the midst of a recovery; the economy is showing signs of strength.\xc2\xa0 We should not do anything to jeopardize the recovery.\xc2\xa0 We should not do anything that halts the growth in the economy or halts the progress we\xe2\x80\x99re making in job creation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And -- which brings us to this budget deal, and one of the things that we have spoken out so clearly about is that while we need to cut spending, we need to reduce the deficit -- we agree with Republicans on both those goals -- that we have to do it in a way that is responsible and that does not jeopardize the recovery.\xc2\xa0 And certainly one thing that we have said that would jeopardize the recovery is if we allowed the government to shut down because of the economic uncertainty it would create.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo he wanted to address within the context of his remarks both obviously the jobs numbers and the broader economic picture, but also these negotiations that are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And he spoke optimistically about the capacity to find common ground that he believes exists, and that that\'s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the American people want us to do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On Libya, today as you know, Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces are making advances against the rebel stronghold in the west, in Misurata.\xc2\xa0 Each day we seem to have a shift in the movement of forces and who\xe2\x80\x99s on top.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern in the White House, or what\xe2\x80\x99s the level of concern in the White House, about the possibility of a -- of this settling into just a bloody stalemate that -- with no chance of actually dislodging Qaddafi and over the near term, if not the midterm?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to step back and broaden the perspective a little bit and not judge the course of the conflict based on advances and retreats day-by-day or hour-by-hour -- which is not to dismiss your point, but just simply to say that the overall trend here is positive in terms of the conflict.\xc2\xa0 The success that the NATO coalition has had in -- or the broader coalition has had in decimating Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces, air assets, air defenses, and forcing him to retreat from Benghazi and other civilian -- other places where they threaten to do great harm to civilians.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously an ongoing situation there, and the NATO mission continues.\xc2\xa0 The NATO now -- NATO-controlled mission, NATO-commanded mission, continues to protect civilians, to enforce the no-fly zone and to enforce the arms embargo.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn a separate track, we are also working very diligently to continue to put pressure on the Qaddafi regime.\xc2\xa0 And I would note, as I did yesterday, that there are a variety of ways to measure Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s relative strength in this situation, or weakness.\xc2\xa0 And I think one measure is to look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening to the circle around him.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, one of his most trusted aides defected, flew to United Kingdom with no immunity, and has abandoned the regime -- abandoned what we think is a sinking ship.\xc2\xa0 And we think that\xe2\x80\x99s an important development.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions on Libya.\xc2\xa0 Republican senators, specifically McCain and Graham, are being highly critical that the United States is pulling U.S. assets out, kind of putting them out of commission as we move into a supporting role, at the same time saying that it remains a priority that Qaddafi must go.\xc2\xa0 Where\xe2\x80\x99s the disconnect there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Senator McCain has also been very supportive of the action the President has taken in general.\xc2\xa0 We simply disagree that -- with the idea that the United States should be militarily decapitating the Qaddafi regime; that it should use military force, unilaterally -- which is what it would mean -- to pursue the policy goal of having Qaddafi no longer rule Libya.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We believe that the course the President took here in building this coalition, in working with not just our NATO allies, but the Arab League and other partners, to build a broad consensus behind military action in a remarkably fast timeframe to protect Libyan civilians at a dramatic moment when the potential for a terrible humanitarian catastrophe existed was an important, important development, and it\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another important aspect in this, as the President I think spoke very clearly about on Monday night to the American people, was that he believes that while this is a situation -- he believes that he retains an absolute right, as the Commander-in-Chief and the President, to use military force unilaterally when the United States is threatened, when American citizens are threatened, when our core interests are threatened, when our allies are threatened.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In other circumstances, when our general interests are affected, when -- and general interests that we share with international partners -- it is better to pursue the avenue that we pursued, which is to build a coalition to share the burden, to share the cost, to share the risk.\xc2\xa0 And also, not just because of the -- those goals are important in and of themselves in a time when we have a lot of commitments around the world, but also to do that because it enhances the prospect of a good outcome; that working with our coalition partners here makes the possibility of a good outcome in Libya greater because it makes clear that the unrest in Libya, the revolution, if you will, has come from the ground up, is driven by the desires and aspirations of the Libyan people, as it has been by the peoples of different countries, and it is not an America operation, it is not American- or Western-inspired.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we think that is very, very important when the President takes the long view about what all these development means -- all these developments mean in the Middle East and what posture we should take to best ensure that our national security interests are protected and that the outcome in the region is as positive as possible for the people of the region and for the people of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And I apologize for giving you such a long answer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No problem at all, but you talk about it coming from the ground up, and we know that -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard over the past many days that you\xe2\x80\x99re assessing who these rebels are, what they\xe2\x80\x99re about, their differing agendas.\xc2\xa0 Our people on the ground say that the opposition is a ragtag group of people with more heart than they have military training and than they have in weapons, quite honestly.\xc2\xa0 So is this -- are these people the people that the administration is relying on to go towards the end goal, toppling Qaddafi?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, our goal of having Qaddafi step down, take himself out of power or be removed from power, is a nonmilitary goal.\xc2\xa0 We support the aspirations of the Libyan people.\xc2\xa0 The opposition to Qaddafi is driven by the fact that Qaddafi was such a brutal leader and did not respond or answer to the desires and aspirations of the Libyan people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We make -- we are making a lot of assessments about the composition of the opposition.\xc2\xa0 We have -- the Secretary of State has met, as you know, with the leader of the National Council in Paris and in London, and we were -- we view positively the statement that was put out by the council about what their vision is for the future of Libya, and the fact that it is inclusive and tolerant and envisions free and fair democratic elections.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely with the contact group that was stood up after the recent conference in London -- broad group of international partners that are participating in that -- to look at ways we can assist the opposition and help imagine with them what the future of Libya will look like.\xc2\xa0 But in the end, it\xe2\x80\x99s up for -- up to the Libyans themselves to decide that future for themselves.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Real quick, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s lost a little bit that many -- like the American people hearing that it\xe2\x80\x99s a political goal that Qaddafi should not be leading, but that we\xe2\x80\x99re pulling these military assets out, and that it should then be kind of driven by the opposition -- who the administration acknowledges they\'re not trained to do, to take on such a fight at the moment.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re in it, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not in it.\xc2\xa0 I think the American people don\'t see a big difference -- if you want Qaddafi to go politically, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we do it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what the American people understand very clearly is that this President did not believe that unilateral military action to remove an Arab leader from power and basically to own that country for the United States was the right course of action in this case.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right for the United States.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right for the region.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right for Libya.\xc2\xa0 And we have some experience with that and the costs associated with doing that.\xc2\xa0 And moreover, the course that he is pursuing with our partners, he believes very strongly, it creates a better opportunity for success in the long run for the Libyan people, for the United States, for the other countries in the region, and for all our allies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the issue of removing assets, I mean, he made very clear his position that we would take the lead initially in the military operation because of our unique capacities to shape the battlefield, if you will, but that we would then step back, still remain part of the coalition, but make that transition to a NATO lead.\xc2\xa0 We are still very much a part of the coalition, but we are not in the lead of the coalition.\xc2\xa0 That means that the burdens and costs of this operation are shared, which we think is a good thing and we think the American people probably think is a good thing, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regarding the massacre at Mazar-e-Sharif that you read the statement from the President about, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- that began as a protest against Pastor Terry Jones burning the Koran or involved in a protest that burned the Koran.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how much the President feels that Terry Jones and his team played a role in what happened in Mazar-e-Sharif, or how much of this is to be viewed as violence in Afghanistan in and of itself?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, my understanding is there were protests around Afghanistan, and that we are still assessing what the cause of the protest was, what the motivation behind them was, and specifically this protest that led to this horrific action that was taken.\xc2\xa0 And we strongly condemn the violence that took place there.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough information about what was the cause to make a comment on it.\xc2\xa0 We have obviously -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99d just leave it at that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of Libya, given the emphasis that you and the administration have been giving to the diplomatic and other efforts to remove Qaddafi from power as opposed to the military ones, is there any update you can give us on information coming from the foreign minister who defected or other efforts to get others from his inner circle to defect, any information about -- information about Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on that for you except that the outreach is ongoing and the broad reports of outreach in the other direction from people in the Qaddafi regime to various folks on the outside has also taken place, as Secretary of State Clinton has mentioned and talked about.\xc2\xa0 But we are not -- it is not clear yet in our mind what that means in terms of Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s view of his situation, in terms of him personally.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Clearly, from Mr. Koussa\xe2\x80\x99s decision to leave, that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication -- at least gives us some insight into the sort of state of the circle around Colonel Qaddafi, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any hard information about his state of mind or how he views his own predicament right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, could you give us your best assessment of the capabilities of the Libyan rebels?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would leave specifics to those who know better at NATO or the Defense Department.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t dispute the idea that this is not a formal military force.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that is part of its -- I mean, it is opposing what was a former military force that is still loyal, parts of which are still loyal to Muammar Qaddafi, precisely because that regime was so brutal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so it is made up of, in many senses, untrained, unexperienced people who are fighting for the right to be more free and to participate more fully in their country\xe2\x80\x99s future and to create more economic prosperity for their children.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding, without -- as I discussed yesterday, obviously there are elements of this very broad opposition that we either don\xe2\x80\x99t know a lot about or we assume that not everybody who opposes Qaddafi is necessarily a friend of the United States.\xc2\xa0 But that the -- that it is not a professional military I think is a notion we can agree on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You said earlier this week that there\xe2\x80\x99s no military option on the table with regard to Syria.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States simply in a position where they\xe2\x80\x99re an observer, with regard to Syria, or is there any option of any sword on the table?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything the government can do other than watch and monitor?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have spoken quite clearly about the need for the Syrian government to refrain from violence, to cease the arrest of human rights activists and lawyers and journalists, to act on the promises that the Syrian President made once in 2005 and made again the other day to initiate a series of reforms that the Syrian people clearly want.\xc2\xa0 And the message -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not an observation role only.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we are working with our allies in the region and speaking directly, or rather publicly, to the Syrian government, urging them to cease the violence and to engage in national dialogue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any actual options -- diplomatic, economic, anything --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prejudge what -- I mean, there are already quite substantial sanctions in place in Syria -- have been since they were passed in 2003.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything more --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously always more that can be done, or potentially more that could be done, in response to a situation in any given country, whether unilaterally or multilaterally -- many measures that could be taken short of military action, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list of specifics that are under consideration.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to say that there are options on the table?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list of the specifics.\xc2\xa0 The team that focuses on the region, focuses on Syria, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure is evaluating the situation.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I know they are and I know that they evaluate various policy options that we might -- the President might pursue.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t enumerate them or describe them to you because it\xe2\x80\x99s premature to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John McCain on Libya.\xc2\xa0 John McCain says he\xe2\x80\x99s working Senator Kerry, Senator McConnell and others to try to pass a -- I know there\xe2\x80\x99s been talk of this, but now there\xe2\x80\x99s a real -- a specific effort, we\xe2\x80\x99re told, to pass a -- to find a resolution that could be overwhelmingly passed by the Senate, maybe just a sense of the Senate resolution, but something that they can vote on.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House discouraging that, encouraging it, involved in it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have said -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that -- if we\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed the specific effort that you refer to, but we have said that we welcome congressional support for the actions that the President authorized and the mission that the United States remains engaged in, both the military mission and the diplomatic, economic, political mission, if you will, that encompasses all the other actions that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking with regard to Libya.\xc2\xa0 So we would, broadly speaking, welcome that support.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last question.\xc2\xa0 John Boehner, just a short time ago, again, said that he denies there is any target number on these.\xc2\xa0 Do you still say there is a target number that he agreed to?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just point you to the statement that he made yesterday that -- and that we agree on -- that there is a target number, but nothing -- there is not an agreement until there\xe2\x80\x99s an agreement; that there is not -- but there is an agreement on a target, that if we -- if we can --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying he has agreed with the $33 billion target number?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- has alternately been described in different terms depending on which baseline you\xe2\x80\x99re working off of.\xc2\xa0 But $73 --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying he agreed to that as a target number?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As a target to give to the appropriators to work off of as they negotiate the details of cuts and spending, and try to find the common ground that would allow us to get to that number in a way that is acceptable to the House, the Senate, and the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Libya, are we withdrawing -- the planes the U.S. is basically withdrawing from the no-fly zone activities tomorrow, will they be replaced by planes from other countries?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, NATO has assumed sole command of the operation, both the enforcement of the no-fly zone and the enforcement of the arms embargo and the enforcement of the civilian protection aspect of the mission.\xc2\xa0 So how that -- how they do that, obviously it involves air assets as well as other assets, and how that breaks down, I would refer you to NATO -- but, yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, the idea that it\xe2\x80\x99s like a withdrawal -- I mean, we made very clear, the President made very clear, that our engagement would be very intense in the beginning, would involve a lot of American assets, a lot of hardware, a lot of pilots, et cetera, and missiles that were utilized; and that we would then -- in a matter of days, not weeks -- pull back, having done the things that we can do uniquely, more effectively, more quickly, better than anyone, and then broaden the effort in terms of participation to the point where we are still obviously a partner in this, participating in this, but it is led by NATO and other coalition partners are contributing the lead assets, if you will, to the enforcement efforts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the ceasefire, Secretary Gates was asked yesterday in one of the hearings whether he could envision the conflict ending with Qaddafi in power.\xc2\xa0 He said, no, but he could envision a ceasefire.\xc2\xa0 And he went on to lay out some of the terms that it seems the opposition has laid out -- stop attacks on civilians, move the troops out of the cities, allow humanitarian aid deliveries, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 Is there any space between the Secretary and the President on this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Zero space.\xc2\xa0 We obviously believe very strongly that it is for the Libyan people to decide their future.\xc2\xa0 We -- the civilian protection mission is probably -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- as he described it and as I understand it -- encompassed in the goals that the opposition talked about that any ceasefire would require the cessation of hostilities, the cessation of violence against the Libyan people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the overall goal -- and I think you referenced this at the top -- is that Qaddafi no longer attempt to or remain in Libya or remain in power.\xc2\xa0 And how that takes place -- obviously, we are engaged and our international partners are engaged in taking measures that we believe move that process along.\xc2\xa0 And, obviously, the Libyan people will and the opposition will engage in that process also.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on today\xe2\x80\x99s job numbers, if I may, they\xe2\x80\x99re getting a lot of cheers.\xc2\xa0 But former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao points out that at 216,000 net jobs a month, it would still be the end of the decade before we got back to pre-recession unemployment rate levels.\xc2\xa0 So does that make this rate of job creation acceptable to the President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President said today is that he wakes up every morning -- and I know this because it\xe2\x80\x99s on his mind when we talk early in the day and it\xe2\x80\x99s on his mind when he goes home at the end of the day -- that this is his focus:\xc2\xa0 job creation and economic growth.\xc2\xa0 He has a lot on his plate but there is no greater priority for him.\xc2\xa0 And what he said today is obviously -- he will not be satisfied until every American who is looking for a job, a well-paying job, finds one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so the answer to your question is of course it is not acceptable -- 8.8 percent, while it is the most dramatic and steep decline in the unemployment rate since 1984, it is certainly still too high.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we are focused, as the President was today, on a variety of measures aimed at continuing the economic recovery, increasing job creation, increasing competitiveness.\xc2\xa0 This is the principal focus of his administration, of his White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question was whether the creation of 230,000-plus private sector jobs is acceptable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I will tell you, it is good news.\xc2\xa0 And to suggest otherwise, I think is -- maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s an April fools\xe2\x80\x99 joke -- but it is rather sour to suggest that the creation of 230,000 private sector jobs and net 216,000 jobs is anything but extremely good news, the kind of sustained job creation at a high level that we have not seen in many, many years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIs it enough?\xc2\xa0 No, it is not.\xc2\xa0 But what your question does I think remind people is how deep the hole is, how deep the hole was, that we found ourselves in because of this recession.\xc2\xa0 Remember that in the first several months that this President took office, in the midst of this terrible recession that was here when we got here, the job loss was in the 700,000-a-month range.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s job loss.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re now at job creation, private sector job creation, in the 200,000-plus range.\xc2\xa0 That is a 900,000 jobs turnaround.\xc2\xa0 Not enough, not good enough, the hole is deep, but we are very happy at the job creation we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, 13 straight months of job creation, the 1.8 million private sector jobs that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen created in these last 13 months.\xc2\xa0 That is good news.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious about this $33 billion/$73 billion.\xc2\xa0 You, the Vice President, have used a number quite frequently.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker said flatly today there is no number.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, is this -- your choosing to emphasize it, is it an attempt to sow dissension between --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the leadership and fiscal conservatives in the House Republican conference?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Our point is that there is no reason that we cannot get a deal here if everyone agrees that they will not -- I mean, I understand that as I think the actions the House is taking today, that they would love H.R. 1 to become law.\xc2\xa0 But as the Speaker said I believe yesterday, this is a government --Congress and the executive branch -- where one portion of it does not get to dictate the outcome.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that measure could not pass the Senate and would be vetoed by the President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it is not the end result.\xc2\xa0 It may be what they wish for in an ideal world, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not happening.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s 2011 baseline budget that he proposed is obviously not happening, right?\xc2\xa0 So what we have made clear is we -- the President will make tough choices.\xc2\xa0 He will -- in the spirit of compromise and finding common ground, he will accept cuts that are hard, accept some details that he would not otherwise in an ideal world want to accept, but that he believes the American people expect us to find that common ground, expect us to be reasonable.\xc2\xa0 Political rhetoric and shooting spitballs is not, I assure you -- and I know you know this -- is not what the American people want out of Washington right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a few billion dollars difference in terms of a top-line number, and that should not be the block over which we stumble to lead to a government shutdown or to demonstrate to the rest of America that we can\xe2\x80\x99t get things done, because we believe we can.\xc2\xa0 And we believe -- notwithstanding the things that have been said, that there is ample common ground available to us to reach a compromise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, just one more.\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on something you said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 You spoke very generally about U.S. intelligence assets being helped -- being used to assist the operation yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, are those assets being -- American intelligence assets being used exclusively for the furtherance of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973, or are they also being used for the furtherance of the unilateral American administration\xe2\x80\x99s goal of having Qaddafi leave power?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I cannot, as you know, speak about intelligence matters in any specific way.\xc2\xa0 The conversation that we had yesterday was with regard to, as the President and others have said and I have said, regard to the things that we can continue to do in support of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973, which is, as a member of the coalition that is enforcing that resolution, that we can supply intelligence --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the resolution is limited to protecting civilians --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, and that\'s what I was -- and that -- and again, that is what I am referring to.\xc2\xa0 But I will not speak about intelligence gathering or operations from this podium.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, can you say whether the American intelligence apparatus is constrained because they\'re working under the auspices of 1973 from helping further the American unilateral goal?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to comment on that one way or the other.\xc2\xa0 I will say, echoing the President, that one of the capabilities that we are still able to -- that we will still provide in our roles advising and assisting and supporting the NATO-led mission is intelligence capacity, intelligence -- the provision of intelligence.\xc2\xa0 But that also includes refueling capacity, the capacity to jam signals of the Qaddafi regime.\xc2\xa0 So there are a variety of ways that we continue to assist the NATO mission.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, one of the cuts that the President himself made in the NASA budget was a funding for the Destiny satellite, which is an earthquake detection capability.\xc2\xa0 Now, given the tremendous turbulence, unprecedented turbulence in this Pacific Ring of Fire that we saw come out in Japan, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it total folly to begin taking down some of these NASA capabilities, given that perhaps solar flares and other things are affecting the magnetic field of the earth, when we can, if not prevent them, at least warn the population in good time to deal with them?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that verge on criminality when we\xe2\x80\x99re faced with this kind of a situation in that region?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me whether or not some position we took that I confess I have -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- is a criminal action or just folly?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the Destiny -- the Destiny satellite --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which is it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- which would allow us to give some lead time, maybe an hour, maybe an hour and a half in, say, San Francisco.\xc2\xa0 If such an earthquake were to hit, you could at least warn the people in time so they weren\xe2\x80\x99t caught totally by surprise.\xc2\xa0 That has been axed out of the budget.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sir, I confess that I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I do not know the specifics of that, the budget line that you referenced.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take that question or if you want to get back in touch with me or my office, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get an answer for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think there are 40 scientists who are protesting the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I certainly think you might ask NASA about it.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take that question and provide my answer, but I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have one right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 NASA is dependent on the President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, but I will -- as I said, I would happily answer that question if I had more information on it.\xc2\xa0 But I will get more information for you if you contact my office after the briefing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back to the budget talks, Harry Reid said the EPA riders are off the table.\xc2\xa0 The White House, he said -- neither the White House nor Senate Democrats will accept EPA riders.\xc2\xa0 Is that your position?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President has said and what I have said and others have said is that we do not believe this process is the right forum for injecting politically charged or ideologically driven agenda items that are highly contentious, the injection of which seem to us to be designed to derail this train that needs to move forward into the station.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate line by line what items are acceptable or unacceptable, but our position on that broad basket of issues is clear.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because, I mean, when you discussed this yesterday, it seemed like you were not specifically taking anything for that matter off the table, and it sounds like he is just taking it off the table.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to refine Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s words.\xc2\xa0 But I will tell you what our position is, which is not to negotiate the items of the hoped-for compromise and resolution from here.\xc2\xa0 Those negotiations are ongoing, and the confidentiality of how that -- of those negotiations is something I will not breach from here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut our overall position about the need to remove from the process those things that seem to us to be wholly unrelated to a deficit reduction and spending cut and funding bill should be removed in order to allow this process to move forward.\xc2\xa0 And if lawmakers have -- feel passionately about a specific issue, they should write legislation, bring it to the floor, and have it debated on the floor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMr. Knoller.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you tell us what the White House thinks of the government shutdown bill that the House is working on this afternoon?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just say what I said earlier, which is that the -- H.R. 1 passed the House, did not pass the Senate.\xc2\xa0 If it had miraculously arrived on the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk, we made clear in a statement of administration policy that the President would veto it.\xc2\xa0 So it will not become the law of the land.\xc2\xa0 I understand that that is the ideal for one segment of Congress, but nobody is going to get everything they want in this process.\xc2\xa0 We have acknowledged that and many others have acknowledged that on both sides.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting exercise.\xc2\xa0 It is not an exercise that brings us any closer to accomplishing what needs to be accomplished for the American people and what they expect us to do.\xc2\xa0 And so we hope that it will not distract attention from the work that needs to be done very quickly to find resolution on funding for the rest of this fiscal year so we can move on to these bigger issues.\xc2\xa0 We are talking about a funding bill for a year that is already almost half over.\xc2\xa0 It needs to get done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And earlier today, you said the President sees a need to agree on details that cut deeply, but not education, R&amp;D, infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what are the programs in which you want to cut deeply?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the substantial cuts the President proposed in his fiscal year 2012 budget, and there were substantial cuts in that, including to programs that he said when he put forward that budget proposal he cares a lot about and would not want to cut in the manner that he is cutting them in an ideal world.\xc2\xa0 And a number of those cuts have been incorporated into some of the proposals that are on the table that are cuts that we can agree on and that Republicans can agree on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he has put forward a series of substantial cuts in a series of areas.\xc2\xa0 And again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to negotiate on specifics, but the point is that there are lines beyond which he feels he cannot go and will not go because the future economic growth of this country depends that those lines not be crossed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last question.\xc2\xa0 On his directive, the greening of the federal fleet, does he want to see his limousines made hybrid or all-electric vehicles?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, the limousines are part of -- I believe run and operated and commissioned by the United States Secret Service, so I would refer you to them on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s his directive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can \xe2\x80\x9cThe Beast\xe2\x80\x9d go green?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can \xe2\x80\x9cThe Beast\xe2\x80\x9d go green?\xc2\xa0 I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 Obviously security matters are not ones that I tend to address from here, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Secret Service for that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Thrush.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, virtually every news outline is reporting, citing the police chief in Afghanistan, saying that demonstrators were at least partially motivated by Terry Jones burning the Koran.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 Do you think he has, to some extent, blood on his hands, this pastor?\xc2\xa0 And the second question is, does this administration have a message to Afghans and other Muslims talking about how they view the burning of the Koran and its -- and the significance of what it says about the United States?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Glenn, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I am going to refrain from now from commenting on what may or may not have been the cause of the demonstrations that led to this horrific act, which is in no way justified no matter -- regardless of what the motivation was.\xc2\xa0 But, again, on the cause, the motivation behind it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate because it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we get it right.\xc2\xa0 So we are looking into that, investigating it.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure when we have some conclusions about that that we make, as opposed to others, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a comment on it and you can -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll comment on it from here if you like.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say anything about it now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason to believe the Taliban instigated this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough information -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough information and we\xe2\x80\x99re still getting that information.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kara.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The Colombian government announced this week that its free trade agreement with Canada is going to be going into effect in July.\xc2\xa0 And the President has obviously said that he wants to finish work on the U.S.-Colombia agreement.\xc2\xa0 But I was just wondering, can you point to any evidence of progress, that progress is actually being made on that front?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can.\xc2\xa0 I was in a meeting this morning with Ambassador Kirk, and that he\xe2\x80\x99s working extremely diligently to try to make progress on the Colombian trade deal.\xc2\xa0 And the President is committed to getting it done, and we have done a lot in the past weeks and months to intensify that activity and -- so that we can get a trade deal that is good for American business, good for American labor, good for America, and move forward and get some of these important trade deals completed and passed, as the highly significant trade deal with South Korea has been completed and awaits passage -- approval from Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any estimate for any goal, any timeline?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sooner than later.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the White House is very upbeat about the unemployment numbers, but there is a concern that the black unemployment numbers inched up two-tenths of a percent to 15.5 percent.\xc2\xa0 And I spoke with Mary Frances Berry earlier, the former head of the Civil Rights Commission, and she said that there needs to be come type of targeted approach for those who continue to be in that number of -- the large unemployment number, and she said an anti-poverty approach, a poverty agenda, per se.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House looking at a targeted approach now as the overall numbers are going down but minority numbers are still going up?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Unacceptably high.\xc2\xa0 The overall number is unacceptably high; the minority number is unacceptably high.\xc2\xa0 And there is no question that is discouraging news that that number ticked up, as you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 It also has come down overall in the last months when -- as the overall rate has come down.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the President, as I noted earlier, wakes up every morning focused on this issue and goes home every night focused on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And he believes very strongly that the economic measures that he has taken have been beneficial to staving off an even worse economic calamity, an actual depression as opposed to the worst recession that we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen -- in generations, rather, since the Great Depression; and that there were very -- there were programs within the Recovery Act and other measures that we took that were -- by their design would help communities that were hardest hit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And those -- we believe those programs have been effective -- not enough, but effective.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re always looking for ways to address -- as the economy recovers, address those areas which are not recovering as well or fast enough, whether they be parts of the economy or communities or regions.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t have a specific new proposal from the President for you, but this weighs heavily on him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Laura.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s going on here?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been ousted.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m out of position.\xc2\xa0 No, you should actually call on Ryan because he was here because I was late, so --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On Ryan, maybe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you yield?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll yield to Ryan.\xc2\xa0 He was here on time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ryan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Ryan Tracy, Dow Jones, and the Journal.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask -- I know you don\'t want to refer to specific policy riders in the budget negotiations, but can you talk generally about whether the administration would accept cuts to health care implementation, for example, or Planned Parenthood?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President has made clear -- first of all, if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the Affordable Care Act, the answer is we believe this is an essential element to reducing the deficit, to ensuring far greater access to health care, to reducing costs for businesses and individuals, so that is an important area to protect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On other issues, it is simply not the place to have those contentious fights on social policy or other types of policy that have nothing to do with funding the government, reducing spending, cutting the -- cutting spending and reducing the deficit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we -- without getting into specifics, because I don\'t want to negotiate it from here, it is very much the President\xe2\x80\x99s position that this is not the vehicle to have those debates.\xc2\xa0 And it is certainly not appropriate, and the American people will not be happy to learn if this thing founders because of an insistence that something be inserted in the bill that is highly contentious and has nothing to do with the fiscal year 2011 funding of the government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that, what -- is there any difference with the EPA riders in that sense?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\'s --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the specifics, Ryan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes -- sorry.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when you were -- in response to Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s question just now and then earlier you were talking about shooting spitballs, is that a characterization that you would talk about in terms of a segment of Congress exclusive to their attitude with regard to policy riders, or is that a generally cavalier or less-than-serious attitude toward the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I like the second part.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I just -- I meant as a general statement.\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aiming that specifically at anyone, and in Washington there have been spitballs delivered from all sides.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the point is, is that this is not a time -- if there ever is a time, this is certainly not one, where the public wants its leaders in Congress, in Washington or in the White House, for that matter, to engage in a lot of heated political partisan rhetoric.\xc2\xa0 When the opportunity for compromise is there, we have shown and the leaders of Congress have shown a capacity to work together in a bipartisan way to compromise and get things done for the American people at a time that when doing that a lot of people would have predicted was impossible -- I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the lame duck session last year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is no reason, given what we know about what the elements of the various proposals are in terms of reducing the deficit and cutting spending in the fiscal year 2011 funding process that we cannot reach a compromise.\xc2\xa0 Not 100 percent of what we want, not 100 percent of what Republicans want, Senate Democrats -- everybody is going to have to give.\xc2\xa0 But there is ample room to find common ground.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t see that attitude coming from one area or another?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we just think it\xe2\x80\x99s not a good approach in general, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the process, we don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people want to hear.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead, Jay?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do have a week ahead.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read the week ahead and get out of here, if I could.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does this include filing with the FEC?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 File with --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wait for it, Chip.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will welcome Israeli President Shimon Peres to the White House for a working lunch.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to discussing with President Peres the full range of issues of common concern, including U.S.-Israeli security cooperation, recent developments across the Middle East, and the pursuit of peace between Israel and its neighbors.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday, the President will --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Coverage?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That was good.\xc2\xa0 I like that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) .<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Wednesday, the President will -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, will travel to the Philadelphia -- (laughter) -- travel to the Philadelphia area to discuss his long-term plan to prevent -- or rather, to protect consumers against rising oil prices and decrease oil imports, as well as key components of his broader energy plan.\xc2\xa0 You may have noticed that we are -- he is, rather, speaking quite a bit about this in these days and weeks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President will visit Gamesa -- I hope I\xe2\x80\x99m pronouncing that right -- Gamesa Technology Corporation in Fairless Hills, where he will hold a town hall discussion with workers about building a 21st-century clean energy economy to win the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday -- also Wednesday, the President will travel to New York, New York, to deliver remarks at the National Action Network\xe2\x80\x99s 20th anniversary and national convention.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe will have more details about Thursday and Friday\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, including -- well, who knows -- early next week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one on Japan?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the specifics on that.\xc2\xa0 I think maybe the Department of Energy might or the NRC.\xc2\xa0 The commitment -- I mean, the longstanding commitment is embedded in the nature of the relationship with our very close ally.\xc2\xa0 And we will do, as the President has said, everything we can and provide any assistance we can to help Japan in this incredibly difficult period.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment, then, on the roughly 150 Marines or so that are either arriving or have arrived today to support with decontamination?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
