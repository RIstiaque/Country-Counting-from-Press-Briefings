Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t11:42 A.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore I get started, I think you saw our updated guidance.\xc2\xa0 As you now know, the President and the First Lady will be attending the transfer of remains ceremony at Andrews -- Joint Base Andrews at 2:15 p.m.\xc2\xa0 That is for the four U.S. personnel who were killed in Libya.\xc2\xa0 And then he will return here to the White House.\xc2\xa0 And there will be press coverage, pool coverage.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton will be joining the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any remarks out there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the President will have remarks.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 On the Libya attacks, was there any intelligence in advance that some kind of attack could take place, especially because so many embassies were taking precautions because of 9/11?\xc2\xa0 Was there any advance warning at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have seen that report, and the story is absolutely wrong.\xc2\xa0 We were not aware of any actionable intelligence indicating that an attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi was planned or imminent.\xc2\xa0 That report is false.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the sequestration, I know you all are delivering the report today.\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t deliver it last week as the law required?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I took this question last week and explained that it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a complex piece of business and that we would have it by the end of this week, and we are releasing it later today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, as you know, the unrest in the Middle East is spreading to other embassies -- U.S. embassies.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s critics are saying this is an indictment of his handling of the Arab Spring, that this has given rise to further inflamed sentiment among Islamists.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we are obviously closely monitoring developments in the region today.\xc2\xa0 You saw that following the incidents in response to this video, the President directed the administration to take a number of steps to prepare for continued unrest.\xc2\xa0 And I noted yesterday in my gaggle that Fridays have tended to be days when protests are larger in the Muslim world, and we were anticipating that.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to criticism, I would note that many observers, commentators, foreign policy experts, as well as elected officials -- both Democrats and Republicans -- have pointed out that the criticism in particular from Governor Romney and his team, in what seems to be an attempt to score a political point, has been both factually wrong and poorly timed.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow is a time when Americans should be coming together.\xc2\xa0 The President is attending a ceremony this afternoon for the return of remains of four U.S. personnel who were killed in Libya as a result of this unrest.\xc2\xa0 And his focus is on ensuring that U.S. personnel and our facilities are protected.\xc2\xa0 That is why he directed his administration to ensure that security would be enhanced around the world at our diplomatic facilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe has, as you know, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve read out these phone calls, had numerous conversations with leaders in the region including the Presidents of Egypt and Libya.\xc2\xa0 He sent a message, a personal message to the leader of Turkey, Prime Minister Erdogan, asking for his assistance to speak out against the violence.\xc2\xa0 And I think you saw that the Prime Minister did that.\xc2\xa0 And the President is very appreciative of these statements and the actions these leaders have taken personally.</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Morsi again today as well as yesterday has spoken out against any violence and committed himself to protecting U.S. diplomatic facilities and personnel in Egypt.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also need to understand that this is a fairly volatile situation and it is in response not to United States policy, not to obviously the administration, not to the American people.\xc2\xa0 It is in response to a video, a film that we have judged to be reprehensible and disgusting.\xc2\xa0 That in no way justifies any violent reaction to it, but this is not a case of protests directed at the United States writ large or at U.S. policy.\xc2\xa0 This is in response to a video that is offensive to Muslims.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, this is not in any way justifying violence, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken very clearly out against that and condemned it.\xc2\xa0 And the President is making sure in his conversations with leaders around the region that they are committed, as hosts to diplomatic facilities, to protect both personnel and buildings and other facilities that are part of the U.S. representation in those countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just follow up on the sequestration as well.\xc2\xa0 Members of Congress are pointing to the fact that the report that you\xe2\x80\x99re due to release today could spotlight the loss of numerous jobs, many of them in defense, criticizing the administration for allowing that to potentially happening and potentially weakening U.S. national security as a result.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to step back and look at what the sequester is.\xc2\xa0 The sequester was put into place as part of the Budget Control Act in order to compel Congress to do its job.\xc2\xa0 The sequester was designed to be bad policy, to be onerous, to be objectionable to both Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And it is important to remember that Democrats and Republicans voted in majorities in both houses of Congress in support of this.\xc2\xa0 And some Republican leaders who are now decrying the sequester were very vocal in their support of it as part of this package, the Budget Control Act, last year.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe whole point of it was to compel Congress to take action to further reduce our deficit, to find $1.2 trillion in additional cuts -- cuts that should come in a balanced, thoughtful way through policy decisions and not in a kind of across-the-board draconian manner that is written into the sequester.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat has been an obstacle to the achievement of reasonable cuts that would account for the $1.2 trillion called for in the Budget Control Act has been the adamant refusal of Republicans to accept the fundamental principle that we ought to deal with our fiscal challenges in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 Republicans have, unfortunately, made clear that they would rather see cuts in defense that could harm our national security, cuts in education and innovation, research and development, in border security, cuts in vital programs and investments that we make as a nation, rather than ask millionaires and billionaires to pay a single dollar more in taxes.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s not a responsible approach.\xc2\xa0 It is not a common-sense approach.\xc2\xa0 It is not a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 One thing that the House could do in its few days here in Washington before it goes off again on recess is follow the Senate\'s lead and pass a tax cut -- an extension of a tax cut or tax cuts -- for the middle class, 98 percent of the American people.\xc2\xa0 These are tax cuts that everybody in Washington agrees on -- Democrats, Republicans, independents.\xc2\xa0 The President agrees with them.\xc2\xa0 Republicans say they want those tax cuts extended.\xc2\xa0 Why won\'t they pass them?\xc2\xa0 Because they insist that millionaires and billionaires need a tax cut, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President believes we can\'t afford that.\xc2\xa0 And we can argue about that, we can argue about whether or not the top 2 percent of taxpayers in America deserve another tax cut as part of the election, and then that can be decided by the election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut why not, for the sake of the middle class, for the sake of economic stability, for the sake of dealing with a large portion of the fiscal cliff, pass the tax cut for 98 percent of the American people today?\xc2\xa0 That would be a very welcome sign I think to the American people that Congress is taking its responsibility seriously and Congress is addressing these challenges in a thoughtful and bipartisan and balanced way.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My colleague from the Associated Press asked you a direct question, was there any intelligence suggesting that there would be an attack on the U.S. consulates.\xc2\xa0 You said that a story -- referred to a story being false and said there was no actionable intelligence.\xc2\xa0 But you didn\'t answer his question.\xc2\xa0 Was there any intelligence, period -- intelligence, period -- suggesting that there was going to be an attack on either the embassy --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There was no intelligence that in any way could have been acted on to prevent these attacks.\xc2\xa0 It is -- I mean, I think the DNI spokesman was very declarative about this that the report is false.\xc2\xa0 The report suggested that there was intelligence that was available prior to this that led us to believe that this facility would be attacked, and that is false.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why was there not adequate security around Ambassador Stevens?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the security at the Benghazi facility or post, I would have to refer you to the State Department for specifics about what security was there.\xc2\xa0 There was a security presence.\xc2\xa0 It was unfortunately not enough to resist the attacks that we saw and resulted in the tragic loss of life.\xc2\xa0 But there was security.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also the case that in reaction to this the President has ordered that we review all of our security arrangements for embassy facilities and other diplomatic facilities around the world.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the specific security that was in place at Benghazi, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it seem logical that the anniversary of 9/11 would be a time that you would want to have extra security around diplomats and military posts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, we are very vigilant around anniversaries like 9/11.\xc2\xa0 The President is always briefed and brought up to speed on all the precautions being taken.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s be --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But saying you\xe2\x80\x99re very vigilant and being very vigilant are different things.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, these protests were in reaction to a video that had spread to the region --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At Benghazi?\xc2\xa0 What happened at Benghazi --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We certainly don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t know otherwise.\xc2\xa0 We have no information to suggest that it was a preplanned attack.\xc2\xa0 The unrest we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen around the region has been in reaction to a video that Muslims, many Muslims find offensive.\xc2\xa0 And while the violence is reprehensible and unjustified, it is not a reaction to the 9/11 anniversary that we know of, or to U.S. policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the group around the Benghazi post was well armed.\xc2\xa0 It was a well-coordinated attack.\xc2\xa0 Do you think it was a spontaneous protest against a movie?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, this is obviously under investigation, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have \xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But your operating assumption is that that was in response to the video, in Benghazi?\xc2\xa0 I just want to clear that up.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the framework?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the operating assumption?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s not an assumption --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because there are administration officials who don\xe2\x80\x99t -- who dispute that, who say that it looks like this was something other than a protest.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there has been news reports on this, Jake, even in the press, which some of it has been speculative.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you is this is under investigation.\xc2\xa0 The unrest around the region has been in response to this video.\xc2\xa0 We do not, at this moment, have information to suggest or to tell you that would indicate that any of this unrest was preplanned.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is true about Libya is that -- well, a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, is it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the more pro-American countries in the region.\xc2\xa0 Two, it is a very new government; it is a country that has just come out of a revolution and a lot of turmoil, and there are certainly a lot of armed groups.\xc2\xa0 So the fact that there are weapons in the region and the new government is not -- is still building up its capacities in terms of security and its ability to ensure the security of facilities, is not necessarily reflective of anything except for the remarkable transformation that\xe2\x80\x99s been going on in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, my last question.\xc2\xa0 It was said that what happened on 9/11 was a failure of imagination, failure of American policymakers and counterterrorism officials to anticipate the kind of attack that could have taken place.\xc2\xa0 This would seem to be the exact opposite.\xc2\xa0 Was this a failure by the Obama administration?\xc2\xa0 Did the President and his administration mess up in any way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, again, what we have seen is unrest around the region in response to a video that Muslims find offensive, many Muslims find offensive.\xc2\xa0 We have seen incidents like this in the past, in reaction to other actions -- cartoons and other actions that have been taken, that have been -- have led to protests and violence in the region.\xc2\xa0 And we have managed those situations, and we are working to ensure that our diplomatic personnel and our diplomatic facilities are secure as we deal with the response to this video, which we believe is offensive and disgusting.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a no?\xc2\xa0 Entirely the fault of the filmmaker?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I think you have to understand what is happening currently in the region and what it is a response to.\xc2\xa0 This is not -- this has been in --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I need to understand that.\xc2\xa0 I think the people who protect the embassies need to understand it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The cause of the unrest was a video, and that continues today, as you know, as we anticipated.\xc2\xa0 And it may continue for some time.\xc2\xa0 We are working with governments around the region to remind them of their responsibilities to provide security to diplomatic personnel and facilities, and we are ensuring that more resources are put in place to protect our embassies and consulates and our personnel in these parts of the world where unrest is occurring.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned a number of times now that this was in response to a video or a film.\xc2\xa0 Would you not agree, though, that it\xe2\x80\x99s moved beyond that?\xc2\xa0 That some are stirring violence by focusing on U.S. policy, or targeting the U.S. in general?\xc2\xa0 That it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer just about the film?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason why there is unrest is because of the film; this is in response to the film.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0 doubt --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what sparked it.\xc2\xa0 You think that\xe2\x80\x99s what sparked it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We do think that\xe2\x80\x99s what sparked it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s moved beyond that, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we obviously are not polling protesters to find out what their motivations are.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that there\xe2\x80\x99s anti-American sentiment in various countries around the Middle East; that\xe2\x80\x99s not a discovery I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made today.\xc2\xa0 What is the case is that the protesters in these countries are not representative of the broader sentiment in those countries, at least in the sense that -- sentiment that would say that the reaction, the proper reaction to a film that is offensive is violence.\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, that\xe2\x80\x99s not in keeping with Islam, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that we do not accept.\xc2\xa0 And we have made clear to leaders in the region that they need to make clear that it is not an acceptable reaction to a film, however offensive it might be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, this is not a film that the United States government had anything to do with.\xc2\xa0 We reject its message and its contents.\xc2\xa0 We find it both disgusting and reprehensible.\xc2\xa0 America has a history of religious tolerance and respect for religious beliefs, and that history goes back to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s founding.\xc2\xa0 But there is absolutely -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, absolutely no justification at all for responding to this movie with violence, and we are making -- we are working, rather, to make sure that Muslims around the globe hear that message.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that at least four people have been arrested in the death of the Americans.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that whoever is arrested for this violence should be tried here in the U.S.?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is an ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously working with our -- with the Libyan government on this matter.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that he wants the assailants, the attackers to be brought to justice.\xc2\xa0 But I am not going to prejudge outcomes or courses of action as this investigation is underway.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then another question on the phone call that the President had with Benjamin Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 Is it correct that the President refused to lay down a red line in terms of what Iran shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cross with its nuclear program?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This has been an ongoing discussion in the press that\xe2\x80\x99s not specific to the phone call -- the one of many that the President has had with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s red line has been clear.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that he is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 We are completely in sync with Israel on that matter.\xc2\xa0 There is no daylight between the United States and Israel when it comes to the absolute commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are pursuing a policy that includes incredibly intense punitive sanctions, unprecedented in history against Iran, of sanctions that are in place as a result of diplomatic work that has created an international consensus that did not exist prior to President Obama taking office and that has resulted, again, in unprecedented pressure and isolation for the regime in Tehran.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is still time and space for that course to be pursued, because the best way to ensure that Iran does not have a nuclear weapon, does not acquire a nuclear weapon is to force and compel Iran to make the decision that it needs to forego its nuclear weapons ambitions, get right with the world, abide by its international obligations under the United Nations, and rejoin the community of nations by doing so.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also the case that this President has made absolutely clear that he does not remove any option from the table in terms of fulfilling his commitment to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve also made clear that the window of opportunity here in terms of pursuing the diplomatic course will not remain open indefinitely.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is a fact is that we have eyes onto the Iranian nuclear program and we would be aware of any so-called breakout move by the Iranians towards building a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That has not occurred, but that window of opportunity will close at some point.\xc2\xa0 And Iran needs to take seriously its responsibilities and to forego and forsake its nuclear weapons ambitions.</p>\n<p>\n\tNancy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to Jake\xe2\x80\x99s question for a minute because it seems like the point he\xe2\x80\x99s asking is not what the cause of the unrest was, but whether there are lessons to be learned by this administration or by the State Department, or by the military about safeguarding diplomatic personnel or restricting their movements, especially in a country as volatile as Libya.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is under active investigation and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a reasonable question.\xc2\xa0 And it stands to reason that there may be lessons learned, as there always are when you have investigations into incidents like this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMy point was simply that we are responding to and coping with and dealing with, with countries around the globe, unrest brought about by this offensive video, and taking action to ensure that security is enhanced and augmented at diplomatic facilities around the globe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Egypt, can you clear up whether the country is an ally or not?\xc2\xa0 The State Department says it is; the President says it\xe2\x80\x99s not an ally, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not an enemy.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you may have heard me, anyway, address this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Let me be clear: Egypt is a critical, strategic partner of the United States.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President had an important conversation with President Morsi very early yesterday morning, very late at night in Colorado, about the need to protect our embassy and our personnel in Cairo, and the need to denounce the violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Morsi expressed his condolences for the tragic loss of American life in Libya, and emphasized that Egypt would honor its obligation to ensure the safety of American personnel.\xc2\xa0 The President is very appreciative of the statement President Morsi made and for the actions he has taken to date to secure our embassy.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me make clear that the President\xe2\x80\x99s interview with Telemundo was not in any way an effort to change our relationship with Egypt.\xc2\xa0 We have had a longstanding partnership with Egypt and have supported their transition to democracy, and we are now working to build our relationship with what is obviously a new government.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We were told that the President was blunt and perturbed in that conversation with President Morsi.\xc2\xa0 What was he concerned specifically about when it comes to the way that President Morsi handled the early hours of this unrest?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President was very clear with President Morsi about Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities as a host nation to provide security to diplomatic facilities and diplomatic personnel.\xc2\xa0 And it was a very productive conversation, as I said yesterday, and it was substantive and long.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily use the adjectives you did to describe how the President felt about the call.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it was a very focused and productive conversation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the sequester, can you describe for us a little bit about how the administration -- what the process was that the administration used to compile this report?\xc2\xa0 Who was involved in making the decisions about what should get cut?\xc2\xa0 And how did they decide what should get cut?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to a briefing we\xe2\x80\x99re going to provide later on the sequester.\xc2\xa0 It is, as I said earlier, a pretty complex piece of business.\xc2\xa0 And the Office of Management and Budget within the Executive Branch is the principal actor when it comes to assessing these things.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Folks at State have said that there was a review of security at diplomatic installations in light of the upcoming 9/11 anniversary.\xc2\xa0 Was there also a review in light of the possible impact of the trailers from this film?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Again, there is always, annually, as well as other moments -- predictable moments on the calendar, measures taken, precautions taken with regards to security both at our facilities abroad, but, of course, here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been transparent in briefing you about when those moments occur and some of the things that are done to help enhance security.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith regard to the specific preparations for 9/11, I would refer you to the State Department for -- as it applies to diplomatic installations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting the impact of the film was less predictable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that the fact that the film was about to inspire this reaction -- well, again, I don\'t want to -- this is all under investigation, so I don\'t want to get that far ahead of -- or get ahead at all of the investigation.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you again to the State Department for whatever precautions were taken for diplomatic facilities in the run-up to the 9/11 anniversary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also a lot of attention on how the President gets his daily briefing, at least in recent days.\xc2\xa0 And the indications are that it has been in written form in the past week or so.\xc2\xa0 Is it your sense that a briefing in person is no more efficient, no more effective than giving the President his PDB in print?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, because it\xe2\x80\x99s selective representation of the facts about the last few days.\xc2\xa0 Just in the last 24 hours, the President has been briefed numerous times, directly, by National Security Advisor Tom Donilon, by Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough, by Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor John Brennan, and others, including a secure call at 2:00 p.m. yesterday and another briefing at 10:00 p.m. yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And he did, as he does every day, obviously have a presidential daily briefing today, and constant updates from his team.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would say that this debate, when you say there\xe2\x80\x99s been some criticism, the quarters from which that criticism come are pretty clear, and who occupies those quarters is pretty clear.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply say that this President is a absolutely responsible and voracious consumer of the presidential daily briefing and of the information provided to him by his national security team.\xc2\xa0 His record of evaluating and acting on intelligence I think speaks for itself.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the criticism less valid because of the quarters from where it comes?\xc2\xa0 The question remains whether --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He gets his -- but what is the question?\xc2\xa0 He gets his presidential daily briefing every day.\xc2\xa0 He has --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The crisis -- the President speaks directly to his national security advisor.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the suggestion here is that\xe2\x80\x99s a more efficient way of communicating than getting a written briefing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he gets both.\xc2\xa0 He does both.\xc2\xa0 He does both all the time -- all the time.\xc2\xa0 And when he is here in Washington he has briefings in person in the Oval Office with his national security team regularly.\xc2\xa0 And when he is on the road, he has phone conversations that supplement and augment the briefings he receives on paper that are specific to the so-called PDB.\xc2\xa0 I hardly think that is different from previous Presidents.\xc2\xa0 And again -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You, in answering the previous questions, have said there was no actionable intelligence with regard to the facility in Benghazi, the consulate in Benghazi itself.\xc2\xa0 Can you say the same with regard to the rest of Libya and the rest of the Middle East?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the DNI and to others.\xc2\xa0 The report was -- I mean, I just -- the report was specific to Benghazi, and we know for a fact that that report is false.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, the Cairo embassy was breached as well.\xc2\xa0 Was there any intelligence that would --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked that question, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was an indication that the President around the U.N. meetings would be meeting with President Morsi on the periphery as these things go.\xc2\xa0 Is that meeting still on?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you just asserted something that was on that you said there was some discussion about, so you kind of did two things in that questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has no bilateral meetings scheduled at this time while he\xe2\x80\x99s in New York.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Formal or informal in any way, shape, or form?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 None that I have to announce at this time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a larger sense, does the President or does the White House feel that relations with the Muslim world in general and the Arab countries in particular are better now than when he took office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have witnessed historic change in the region in just the last few years.\xc2\xa0 This President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to what has been called the Arab Spring, to this unrest has been to lay out a set of principles and support for human rights, and to make clear that we support a process of non-violent, political and economic change and reform in the region.\xc2\xa0 That looks different in different countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are countries where the transition has occurred or is occurring, like Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Tunisia.\xc2\xa0 And in those countries, we are working to help those new governments consolidate their democracies, deal with security needs, and stabilize their economies.\xc2\xa0 In other places like Syria that are still in the throes of a revolution, we have vocally opposed the brutality of the regime and are supporting the aspirations of the people.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us document and discuss the non-lethal support we\xe2\x80\x99re providing to the opposition, the over $100 million in humanitarian aid that we\xe2\x80\x99re supplying to the Syrian people, and the diplomatic support that we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided them.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a circumstance of dramatic change that has come because of a fervent desire by people of the region to have greater rights, greater freedoms, greater control over their lives.\xc2\xa0 And we have actively engaged in the region to support non-violent democratic transition, to support governments that profess and demonstrate support for civil rights of all peoples, both genders and minorities.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with these countries to help them progress in a way that is better for the people of those countries and better for the national security interest of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All great intentions at this moment, embassies across the region are under siege, so it appears that the message isn\xe2\x80\x99t getting through.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the question, or the statement, rather.\xc2\xa0 But the unrest that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is in reaction to a film with which the United States government had no involvement, which we have denounced is offensive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as I said yesterday, obviously, it can be difficult to understand in some countries why the United States can\xe2\x80\x99t simply eliminate this kind of expression.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, it is in the absolute core of our being as Americans that we allow freedom of expression that is written into our Constitution and is one of our fundamental principles.\xc2\xa0 And protecting speech, even offensive speech, is a foundational principle of our democracy.\xc2\xa0 But we can nevertheless denounce and condemn expressions of speech that we find offensive, and we have made that clear around the world, as well as here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Jared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you just answered my question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Excellent.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Muslim Brotherhood in both Egypt and Tunisia has kind of suggested they want the U.S. and the Obama administration to apologize for this video.\xc2\xa0 Is that something you all have considered doing or have done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 We have made clear that we find it offensive and reprehensible and disgusting, but we -- I mean, if in that sense, you mean we have denounced it, we have said we find it offensive and reprehensible, but we will not -- we cannot and will not squelch freedom of expression in this country.\xc2\xa0 It is a foundational principle of this nation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, freedom of expression issues aside, do you know of any government agencies who are trying to get to the bottom of who produced this video?\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of reporters attempting to find out its origin, buy I have not heard of any.\xc2\xa0 But I just -- you would have to direct that at some other agencies.\xc2\xa0 But not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see any reason for any federal agencies to look into it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 I think based on what I\xe2\x80\x99ve just said, the issue here isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- we all know what the film is and its contents and understand why it is offensive to Muslims.\xc2\xa0 We also understand that there is no justification for violence and reaction to that, and have made that message clear around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has made statements, the Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 We have consulted with leaders -- Muslim leaders around the world and asked them to make clear that violence is not an acceptable response to this film.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the President made aware of this film before or after the violence?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Made aware of the film?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Because it seems like you\xe2\x80\x99re pinning a lot of this on the film.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious when the President was aware of a film that could be potentially incendiary.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of -- I certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware of the film before there was unrest related to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And if I could just follow up on -- you earlier said the cause of the unrest was a video, then you repeated something similar later on.\xc2\xa0 And I just want to be clear, that\'s true of Benghazi and Cairo?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that that -- the incident in Benghazi, as well as elsewhere, that these are all being investigated.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that we have no evidence at this time to suggest otherwise that there was a preplanned or ulterior instigation behind that unrest.</p>\n<p>\n\tChristi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did the White House ask YouTube to take that video down?*</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to -- I don\'t believe so, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or anybody in the administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Chicago teacher strike --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe -- I mean, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- based on press reports, it was taken down in the region, right, not everywhere?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wondered if the -- anyone from the administration had intervened or made a request or anything like that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me take that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Chicago teacher strike, has the President weighed in with the parties to those talks in any way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have been very clear that we hope and expect both sides to resolve this in a manner that is positive for the most important affected party here, which are the students, the children of Chicago.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the position we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether there\xe2\x80\x99s been phone conversations with various people involved.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we believe the party should come together and resolve this in a way that is best for Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s students.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he may have called, did you say?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I just -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any phone calls to report out.\xc2\xa0 What our position has been is to make clear that we want this resolved in a manner that is best for Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s students.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got ties to labor and management, obviously.\xc2\xa0 Does he feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s his role to get involved in any way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we -- what\xe2\x80\x99s important here is that the two sides here and all the parties that are stakeholders come together, work out a resolution that gets -- makes sure that the children of Chicago are back in school getting an education, and that everybody involved is guided by a desire to do what\xe2\x80\x99s best for the kids, because that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s most important.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Jon-Christopher.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, it seems like the unrest has now spread through the Sudan as of this morning.\xc2\xa0 Can you shed any light on any conversations the President has had with his closest allies -- for example, Great Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Prime Minister Cameron, President Hollande of France, or Chancellor Merkel in Germany?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 About the unrest?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, any conversation they may have had very recently.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other foreign leader conversations to read out.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve read out a number of them in the last 24 to 36 hours, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t include those top allies?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls with any other foreign leaders to read out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be talking to them over the weekend do you think?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a schedule to announce of foreign leaders calls.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s always possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tLeslie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you go back a little bit on the call that he made to the President of Egypt?\xc2\xa0 Was there anything in particular that prompted that call?\xc2\xa0 And apparently they\xe2\x80\x99ve erected a new fence -- a wall overnight, a concrete wall.\xc2\xa0 Was that discussed during the call with the President?\xc2\xa0 Is that something --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think specific measures were discussed.\xc2\xa0 The point of the call -- remember, he made several\xc2\xa0 -- he has made several calls to leaders in the region -- was to discuss with them the unrest and the measures that these countries are taking to ensure the security of diplomatic facilities and American personnel.\xc2\xa0 And that was the crux of the conversation with President Morsi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he express displeasure with the initial reaction from the Egyptian government and ask them to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We gave a readout of the call.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have more for that -- more on that for you.\xc2\xa0 I think he made clear that we have an important strategic partnership with Egypt.\xc2\xa0 We are working very closely with Egypt and the government there to assist it in helping it stabilize the situation in the country and helping its economy improve as it transitions to democracy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President also made clear that Egypt has obligations, as do other countries in the region and countries all over the world, to ensure that diplomatic representations in those countries are secure.\xc2\xa0 The whole point of embassies and diplomatic facilities, the purpose behind them is to allow for the peaceful interaction between nations to build relationships, build partnerships, and to avoid conflict.\xc2\xa0 And that is why it is so important that embassies, consulates, other facilities, and personnel are protected.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Alexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you were talking about the U.S. experience with reactions to either accidental or purposeful anti-Muslim -- burning of Qurans, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, are U.S. personnel who are abroad, who are seeing this erupt now over what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is, as far as we know, just based on a film reportedly by anti-Muslim folks -- is there a concern in the U.S. government that this would encourage others who have these motivations to continue trying to inject these thoughts into that part of the world where this reaction could be predicted?\xc2\xa0 And is the United States or the government making any additional effort to either surveil to protect American personnel or monitor this information, or to consider this almost like an act of war, to be continuing to inject that kind of thought into that region?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Alexis, I think we have as a nation been in a posture, especially since 9/11, but even prior to that, where we have monitored and been aware of anti-American sentiment in that region of the world and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, we are absolutely vigilant and continue to be, and that is the work of many agencies, in particular the intelligence community.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince 9/11, we have seen periods like this where there has been an unrest in reaction to specific incidents, including Danish cartoons and including other incidents that have taken place that have offended Muslims in different countries and led to unrest directed at either the West or specifically at the United States.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that both this administration and the prior administration have had to manage.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of policy, we continue to make clear that in this case, we find the video reprehensible and disgusting.\xc2\xa0 We continue to try to get the message out as broadly as we can that this video is -- has nothing to do, is not in any way related to the American government.\xc2\xa0 It does not represent who we are or what we believe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we continue to pursue policies in the region that are aimed at helping these countries that are in transition, through this traumatic transformation that\'s happening, towards democracy, towards a better future, and towards -- we hope and are working for -- a strong, better relationship with the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tGoyal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, as far as this 9/11 anniversary and violence around the Middle East is concerned, last week there was a peace walk by the interfaith community walking from Cathedral to the Mahatma Gandhi statue in front of the Indian Embassy.\xc2\xa0 And they all spoke -- Muslims, Hindus, and Christians and Jews -- all faiths from around the globe, they were there -- hundreds of them.\xc2\xa0 They all spoke for peace and unity, and they were saying that President Obama has brought peace in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 And they spoke against violence in the name of religion.\xc2\xa0 But still, we have this violence around the globe, or in the Middle East or in Libya in the name of --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do you have a question, Goyal?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in the name of religion.\xc2\xa0 My question is that you think the President needs another message for those people who are being misguided and misled in the name of religion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken a lot today about the message that the President is carrying, the message that the Secretary of State is carrying, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear more about that.\xc2\xa0 But I mean, that\'s -- I really can\'t go beyond that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, if I may, as far as Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear is concerned, do you believe that the President has any information that the Chinese companies are helping Iran as far as their nuclear ambitions are concerned?\xc2\xa0 And also, Chinese companies are supplying some weapons to the terrorists?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any response to that question.</p>\n<p>\n\tDennis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about how the decisions are made about who the President is talking to?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we saw reports from Tunis and Khartoum just before you came out here.\xc2\xa0 For example, would he not speak to the President of Sudan versus Yemen, Egypt, India, for example, about events and risks in those locations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking.\xc2\xa0 He has made a number of phone calls, had a number of conversations with leaders in the region.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not precluding other phone calls and other conversations that he might have.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s reaching out in order to make clear our position and make clear our expectation of these countries and their governments in terms of their obligations to provide security for diplomatic facilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is Donilon or Brennan advising or suggesting specific --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly, those two men are part of his -- are very key members of his national security team, but I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s limited to those two.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you clarify something?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I could try.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve taken about four or five questions during the course of the briefing.\xc2\xa0 Can you be sure to pump the actual answers that you come up with to those out -- to the full press list and not just have them disappear somewhere, as they tend to do sometimes?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I promise to follow up on those questions I took.\xc2\xa0 If I don\'t have answers that I can provide, I --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, can you distribute them to the press list the way you would the transcript of the briefing, et cetera?\xc2\xa0 Because we all share the same questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If we have the answers that are responsive to the questions, yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, it depends on what the question is and whether I\'m able to answer it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, notwithstanding your explanations today for the reasons for the violence in the Middle East, there are Republicans -- Donald Rumsfeld, John McCain -- who say the attacks on our diplomatic posts in the Middle East are a result of perceived American weakness.\xc2\xa0 Do you want to respond to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just go back to what I said, which is that this is a time when it\'s in the best interests of the country to focus on the four personnel, the four Americans that we lost in Libya and who are returning home today, and on the measures that we need to take as a nation to deal with the unrest in the region and deal with the security of our diplomatic facilities and personnel abroad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are happy to debate -- and there is certainly ample time and appropriate times to debate foreign policy approaches, this President\'s record on foreign policy, and contrast it to other approaches and other records.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there will actually be a formal occasion in which foreign policy will be debated as part of the presidential campaign debates.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure there will be much discussion of it prior to and after that debate.\xc2\xa0 We\'re very proud of the President\'s record on foreign policy and are happy to make the case at the appropriate time.\xc2\xa0 Thank you all.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, one last question -- while we were sitting here -- Secretary Panetta and the Vice Chair of the Joint Chiefs briefed the Senate Armed Services Committee.\xc2\xa0 And the senators came out and said their indication was that this, or the attack on Benghazi was a terrorist attack organized and carried out by terrorists, that it was premeditated, a calculated act of terror.\xc2\xa0 Levin said -- Senator Levin -- I think it was a planned, premeditated attack.\xc2\xa0 The kind of equipment that they had used was evidence it was a planned, premeditated attack.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything more you can -- now that the administration is briefing senators on this, is there anything more you can tell us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we wait to hear from administration officials.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\'s actively under investigation, both the Benghazi attack and incidents elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 And my point was that we don\'t have and did not have concrete evidence to suggest that this was not in reaction to the film.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously investigating the matter, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure both the Department of Defense and the White House and other places will have more to say about that as more information becomes available.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR.
