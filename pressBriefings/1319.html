EDT</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kick off with Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to this gesture, release the prisoners by the Cuban government?\xc2\xa0 Do you see this smoothing relations at all?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports.\xc2\xa0 The State Department is following this closely, and I would look for any reaction, if it indeed does happen, from those guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm any details about it at all, I take it?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Not at this point.\xc2\xa0 The State Department is monitoring it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about the prisoner swap in Russia?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This is an ongoing law enforcement matter, and I would direct you to the Department of Justice for any further developments on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Got any details on what the Israeli government announced yesterday about a nuclear deal with the United States on civilian nuclear technology?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any information on that at all?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of these reports.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no nuclear cooperation agreement with Israel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not, you said?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything to say about today\xe2\x80\x99s oral arguments in the appeals court over the drilling ban, drilling moratorium?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, as the President said, the moratorium was important so that -- because we needed to do everything that we could in order to ensure the safety of workers who are working on there and ensure the protection of our environment.\xc2\xa0 So obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re involved here and following it closely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will you guys announce a new drilling moratorium?\xc2\xa0 Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that the response -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t Interior working on a new one?\xc2\xa0 Is that forthcoming?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I would stay tuned on that.\xc2\xa0 I would say that sooner than later.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little about why the President is going to Nevada to campaign for Senator Reid and how important Leader Reid is for the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Both Reid and Carnahan on these trips are important individuals.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to be out talking about some of the choices that Americans will face as we get closer to the fall here and people go to vote, whether they want to choose someone who is going to continue the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made or choose someone who\xe2\x80\x99s wanting to go back to the policies that got us into the crises that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in.</p>\n<p>Leader Reid has been an important partner and ally, and is someone who is fighting hard for folks in Nevada.\xc2\xa0 The President has been out here before, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work hard to make sure that he continues on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the message going to be today at the economic event?\xc2\xa0 Anything different?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the company that we\xe2\x80\x99re visiting, Smith Electric Vehicles, is the kind of company that has helped to bring our country back from the vicious recession that we found ourselves in.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to grow their company with help from the Recovery Act and some innovation, and build on the growth that our country has seen over the course of the last 18 months.</p>\n<p>The President is not satisfied with the speed of the recovery, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to find ways to create an environment where people can create more jobs and businesses can grow and the American economy can continue to grow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 The clean energy piece of the whole -- of the President\xe2\x80\x99s effort is a much more long-term piece, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there may be some jobs with this company, but that ultimately he talks about investments in the technologies of the future and what have you.\xc2\xa0 How do you get the American people to be patient for that piece of it since that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously years down the road coming to fruition when people want jobs now?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect the American people to be patient.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not patient.\xc2\xa0 He wants things to move as fast as they can.\xc2\xa0 And of course, he wishes that the progress moved faster.\xc2\xa0 But all we can do is bring to bear the good ideas that are helping to create the sort of growth that builds our economy, that creates new jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what these kinds of jobs are.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got these investments here, you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some long-term ideas on how you continue to create jobs here in the sector.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s feeling is that the country that leads on renewable energy is the country that will lead the world.\xc2\xa0 And when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got four other countries -- China, Germany -- all over the world making these kinds of investments, there\xe2\x80\x99s real competition out there.\xc2\xa0 So the President is not playing for second place.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s fighting hard to make sure that we have the most advanced technology, that we\xe2\x80\x99re creating all the jobs that we can to grow our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any legitimacy to the narrative that he\xe2\x80\x99s been to Missouri as often as he has because of some sense of competition or regret over having lost the state two years ago?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would say that that is not the reason we\xe2\x80\x99ve been to Missouri.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been to Missouri to talk about all sorts of things, from how you can create jobs in rural areas to how you help create jobs around ideas like the ones that they\xe2\x80\x99re producing Smith Electric Vehicles.\xc2\xa0 Tonight, the President will be helping some campaigns out in the state.</p>\n<p>So I would say it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot less about his own inter-competitive spirit and more just about doing his job as President.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But five times more than any other state he\xe2\x80\x99s been there, except for Louisiana?\xc2\xa0 I mean, why Missouri?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Missouri is a great state.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be back there.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a place where people have good ideas about how to grow the economy.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve got some questions about what the President is doing to move our country forward.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been other places in the country multiple times, and you can bet that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 But, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s not based in any sort of competitiveness with what happened in 2008.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden gives Harry Reid about a 55 percent chance.\xc2\xa0 What do you give him?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He gives him what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden gives Harry Reid about a 55 percent chance -- in an interview.\xc2\xa0 What do you say about that?\xc2\xa0 What do you guys give him?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I never go to Vegas, but I\xe2\x80\x99m no odds maker.\xc2\xa0 Harry Reid is a fighter.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s where he started his career.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing right now.\xc2\xa0 And we have no doubt that this is going to be a competitive race.\xc2\xa0 But of course we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to come back and continue to be our Leader, come next year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any contradiction between Obama\xe2\x80\x99s message at these events that has been particularly partisan, attacking individual House members by name, and the campaign that he ran for President, bridging partisan divides and so forth?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 What the President said was he was going to come to Washington and do everything he could to move our country in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 And when there are moments that are -- that help to illustrate the differences between our philosophy and their philosophy, the President has taken it upon himself to point those out to the American people and say clearly that our view is that we need to continue to make progress and not go back to the same policies that got us into this mess.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say before, these are the same guys who drove the car into the ditch and now they want the keys back.\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s his view is that we can either go forward or go backwards.\xc2\xa0 At least we\xe2\x80\x99re going forward, and where he can make that case he does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you to see if we can\xe2\x80\x99t get the remarks -- do you know if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get the remarks ahead of time?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re still being typed up.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully the remarks for Smith Electric you should have pretty soon.\xc2\xa0 They may have been sent out down on the ground; I\xe2\x80\x99ll check on that, actually.\xc2\xa0 But for the fundraisers, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get them to you as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been to these before, he often goes off script a lot --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I meant the Smith Electric --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- just because we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a tight turnaround after that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be any more pushback against this idea that the White House is anti-business?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that that -- the question of whether or not the White House is anti-business is the wrong question.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re for -- are we for creating a climate where --</p>\n<p>(Interruption.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any pushback against this notion that he\xe2\x80\x99s anti-business?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President is for creating an environment where businesses can create jobs and help to continue grow the American economy.\xc2\xa0 Are we going to agree with the business community on every single issue?\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 But we came -- the President came into office saying that he was going to do some very specific things, like financial regulatory reform, which he talked about repeatedly on the campaign trail, if you go back to Cooper Union or the Nasdaq speech.\xc2\xa0 He said he was going to close loopholes for overseas investments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so maybe those things aren\xe2\x80\x99t always going to be popular with business, but if you look at where we were and where we are now, the President has made progress on the economy.\xc2\xa0 He has brought us to a place where the economy is growing, where jobs are being created, as opposed to losing 700,000 a month like we were when we came into office.</p>\n<p>But there are going to be times when we disagree, and that\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s -- the President has a governing philosophy that says that we need to do what we can to create jobs and grow the economy, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do that at the expense of necessarily giving discrete businesses or individual businesses every single thing that they may want.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you -- what is he going to say tomorrow at UNLV?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to talk about how we grow the economy, what sort of investments the government can make, working with private industry to leverage as much growth and jobs as we can through things like renewable energy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s event, I thought it was a financial reg reform event.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Nope.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be any new thing?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the way you articulated that question.\xc2\xa0 It will be some things that -- some initiatives that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about before, but the President will talk about some of the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to make and some of the things that we needed to do going forward to continue on the path of growth.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n11:48 A.M.
