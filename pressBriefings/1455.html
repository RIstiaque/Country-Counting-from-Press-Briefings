SGT</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to do this rather quickly because the President is running -- Helene, you looked awfully disappointed when I said we were going to do this quickly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I didn\'t see you come in.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the voice of -- never mind.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to do this rather quickly; the motorcade is going to leave rather shortly.\xc2\xa0 The President is a tad behind schedule.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m going to bring up Mike McFaul and Ben Rhodes to answer some questions.\xc2\xa0 Mike will give us a quick readout, much of which you heard from the two Presidents a few moments ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The only thing that I would add to what has happened thus far today -- the President was just, as you know, in the scheduled meeting with the 10 ASEAN nations and brought up in the meeting the -- reiterated exactly what he said yesterday in Tokyo about the release of Aung San Suu Kyi by Burma.\xc2\xa0 So he brought that up directly with that government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'ll give this over to Mike.</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll be brief.\xc2\xa0 Today the Presidents met for the fourth time.\xc2\xa0 The subject matter, as they expressed at the end of the meeting, was the START treaty -- the new START treaty, Iran, and a few other issues -- a little bit on Afghanistan and some other economic issues.</p>\n<p>On the new START treaty, we progressed.\xc2\xa0 We talked about some sticky issues that still have to be resolved.\xc2\xa0 And both Presidents committed to trying to get a new treaty in place by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 And they said that publicly and that was a big part of the discussion on the substance of that treaty.</p>\n<p>Second, we talked about Iran, again, as we do at every meeting that we\'ve had with President Medvedev.\xc2\xa0 And again, as they said publicly, what they discussed privately, we had a very constructive relationship with the Russians in terms of the offer that we had on the Tehran research reactor.\xc2\xa0 We worked very closely with them in all aspects of that deal.\xc2\xa0 And time is running out, as the President said and as President Medvedev also affirmed, in terms of -- the offer has been on the table and we have to consider other measures and other ways to go if the Iranians are not going to be serious about the diplomatic path.</p>\n<p>And then we discussed Afghanistan briefly.\xc2\xa0 The President just informed President Medvedev about the review and told him that once we have our review done, that he\'ll debrief him through either his government or him personally.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Any questions for Mike?\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two.\xc2\xa0 On START, the commitment is to have it in place by the end of December, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it expire in mid-December?</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it does expire on December 5th.\xc2\xa0 And in parallel, we have a bridging agreement that we also are working with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 I fully suspect we\'ll be able to get that in place by December 5th.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re definitely not going to make the December 5th deadline, though?</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know that for sure, but what I do know for sure is that we won\'t have a ratified treaty in place by December 5th.\xc2\xa0 That has to go through our Senate, through their Duma.\xc2\xa0 So that is for sure we do need a bridging agreement no matter what.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of Iran, do you talk about specific timetables for sanctions to go through the U.N. Security Council?</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 We didn\'t talk specific timetables and I think -- the way I would describe it is we\'re exactly on the same page with the Russians in terms of what we\'re doing in one track and what we may need to do in the other track.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, let me reiterate what the -- I mean, I think you heard the President -- President Obama say and the two Presidents agree on that time is running out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\'ve heard time is running out before.\xc2\xa0 How long can time run out?\xc2\xa0 Can this go on indefinitely?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we talked about the fact that -- in the G20 in Pittsburgh -- that we were focused on the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there some frustration here, though, that this two-track approach may not be working?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s been no movement on it, right?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I can\'t make the Iranians agree three weeks after -- stick to an agreement they made three weeks earlier.\xc2\xa0 But this is, I think as these guys would tell you and what President Medvedev said today, this is not talk for talk\'s sake.\xc2\xa0 This is -- there are clear goals and responsibilities that are on the table for the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 Everybody thinks it\'s a very fair proposal -- so fair that they thought it was a good idea just a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>We are in a position with our partners all working together in a way that we have not previously been.\xc2\xa0 I think that is the key in the event that we get to a place where other actions need to be taken.</p>\n<p>Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike, on the START issue, last week Under Secretary Tauscher said she was very disappointed in the counteroffer that the Russians brought to General Jones, and I\'m wondering if anything has been bridged since then.\xc2\xa0 And is the dispute still on -- mostly on launch vehicles --</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 We have -- this is a negotiation that we\'re not going to keep reading out in a tit-for-tat.\xc2\xa0 We said that a long time ago.\xc2\xa0 Today we discussed all the issues, including the one you just raised.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not the only one.\xc2\xa0 And I would describe it as progress.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not at the endgame yet, we\'re not at the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 We still have some fairly major things to finish.\xc2\xa0 And to get into the details, I think, would be -- as I think you saw Mr. Lavrov\'s reaction to that press -- we\'re just not going to talk about the negotiations in a week -- day-by-day, week-by-week basis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just walk through the timeline, though, that -- how you expect to get a ratified treaty by the end of the year?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what is it --</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 No, no, we didn\'t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Nobody said that.\xc2\xa0 We said we\'re going to sign a treaty by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We did this last week, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 It\'s health care by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- I understand by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 But just to be clear --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- so you don\'t expect to have a ratified --</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 There\'s just no way we can do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No chance of that happening.</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 We have a process that does not allow that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Michael, will the (inaudible) --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I want to reiterate, they said we\'re going to get it done by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 We have not talked about the modalities of when and where or how.\xc2\xa0 We just haven\'t got to that point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on Burma, can you elaborate a little on what he said?\xc2\xa0 Did he say it in front of a whole group?\xc2\xa0 Did he say --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it was --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what was the seating arrangement?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 It was in the ASEAN 10 --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Boy, girl, boy.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 It was in the ASEAN 10 with all of the 10 nations.\xc2\xa0 The President I think led off the meeting with the first intervention.\xc2\xa0 We could double-check that, but my understanding was that he was giving the first intervention.</p>\n<p>And I can tell you that in his intervention, he used exactly the same language that he used in the speech.\xc2\xa0 So privately he said the exact same thing that he said publicly in enumerating the steps that the government of Burma must take:\xc2\xa0 freeing all political prisoners, freeing Aung San Suu Kyi, ending the violence against minority groups, and moving into a dialogue with democratic movements there.</p>\n<p>In other words, if you check the speech of the Tokyo language, which we can get to you, that\'s what he said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he sitting next to the Burmese leader?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe so -- again, we\'ll double-check this, but I believe that the host -- Singaporeans and the Thais were next to the President, but we\'ll check that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he have any personal interaction?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have to -- the meeting is kind of still happening.\xc2\xa0 I mean, here\'s what -- I mean, what our understanding is they went in the meeting, sat down, the President gave an intervention.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you putting out a statement, a group statement on human rights or --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 There\'s a joint statement that will be put out. Again, we\'d have to check the text of that.\xc2\xa0 It\'s obviously a joint communiqu\xc3\xa9 of the 10, which includes Burma, so the President\'s language is obviously going to be stronger than what\'s in that statement, though the statement does make reference to human rights.\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to check the exact text.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\'t make reference to her?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe the statement makes reference to her.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did we try to get it -- did we make an attempt to include Aung San Suu Kyi in the statement --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe so.\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to check that, though, with our guys.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, the statement is of the 10 governments, including Burma, so naturally -- but the President\'s position is the same one he reiterated in Tokyo.\xc2\xa0 He delivered that directly and as a part of our approach of taking this message to them directly, enumerating the steps while maintaining the very strong sanctions that we have on the Burmese government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the APEC meeting (inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We have to check with Mike.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We saw the -- I think I\'ve seen a couple of questions on this, and I\'ll try to get clarity from Froman.\xc2\xa0 He, I think, was in there, so I\'ll try to get something from him.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike, what is the bridging agreement going to say?\xc2\xa0 Does it do anything other than just take the status quo and continue it until things are signed?\xc2\xa0 Does it do anything else?</p>\n<p>And secondarily, was there anything presented to the two leaders today that they were able to resolve along -- within the confines of the START negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 The bridging agreement hasn\'t been negotiated yet, so --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s another order of business?</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.\xc2\xa0 So what it will say -- we\'ll have to wait until we get an agreement.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t see it -- we\'ve talked to the Russians about it.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Prikhodko, by the way, met with General Jones today earlier in the day to talk about that, as well.\xc2\xa0 It\'s more of a technical issue.\xc2\xa0 It will be to continue -- but we haven\'t -- need to be clear, we don\'t have an agreement yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it would be to continue the current START.</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The idea -- so that nothing -- we\'d just say, hey, we\'re extending this beyond --</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 So there\'s no interruption.\xc2\xa0 And the key thing there is verification.\xc2\xa0 We just want to preserve the verification.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For like a year?\xc2\xa0 Until --</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t tell you because we don\'t have the agreement yet, and it will depend I think a lot upon when we get the new START treaty.\xc2\xa0 Those things will go together, right?\xc2\xa0 So I just would say, we don\'t see any gaps coming up down the road, in terms of one -- with this bridging agreement, the notion of a bridge, as it leads to somewhere -- it leads to the other agreement, right?\xc2\xa0 So depending on when that timing is, that\'s when we\'ll get there.</p>\n<p>Again, I\'d just -- we made progress.\xc2\xa0 And I really don\'t want to talk about the specifics, because the Russians have asked us to not talk about the specifics.\xc2\xa0 This is a negotiation, so --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, without getting specific, can you just deal with the general question, if there were things presented, either technical or political, that they were able to resolve at their level --</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and communicate down?</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there will.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, because that would be -- that would be how you would define of "progress."</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran, are the two nations -- are the United States and Russia actively working on what the sanctions would be in the event that time does run out at the end of the year?\xc2\xa0 Will they be ready to go when time runs out at the end of the year?</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve agreed to -- the President said that to get to those points, whenever that is -- and we haven\'t defined it, so -- but when it comes, that the United States and Russia will be pivotal in showing unity as we move to that place.</p>\n<p>The specifics, you know, I think we\'ve agreed that we\'re going to discuss -- like with the START treaty, we\'re going to discuss those privately and talk about those privately.\xc2\xa0 But the key point here is that the relationship with Russia -- and just as we\'ve been lockstep with them on the negotiation path, we\'re also going to do that as we move to this other path.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are they now working on -- together on what those sanctions or whatever you call them might be -- will be?\xc2\xa0 Or is that work for the future?</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve begun that discussion at the highest levels.\xc2\xa0 And again, we don\'t want to read out the negotiation every time.\xc2\xa0 We want to have it in place before we start talking about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the highest levels means they talked about it today?</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, of course.\xc2\xa0 Just to reiterate -- as they have every -- like they did in New York, right?\xc2\xa0 I just want to reiterate this is not a new conversation.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had that conversation before.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but was it a conversation on specific sanctions or just the idea and the concept of sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. McFAUL:\xc2\xa0 We\'re discussing that path.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it\'s appropriate, in the START treaty, to talk about the details of what it might be.\xc2\xa0 I know our Russian counterparts don\'t want us to do that, so I\'m not going to do it right now.\xc2\xa0 But both Presidents said time is running out, and therefore we have to make the preparations now to deal with contingencies should the Iranians decide that they don\'t want to be serious about the diplomatic path.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 One more, and then we got to get to the -- back to the hotel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I just wondered if we could get a quick read on discussions with the Chinese about the town hall, the format, how it\'s going to be disseminated to the people of China.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think what we expect for the event is that there\'s an audience of several hundred students, young people, young Chinese.\xc2\xa0 They come from several different universities in the Shanghai area.\xc2\xa0 They were I think largely invited by the departments of those universities, the department heads within those universities.\xc2\xa0 We have also solicited questions through various Internet -- various sources on the Internet, so that the President will be taking questions both from students in the room but he\'ll also have the opportunity to take -- have questions that came in through the Internet.\xc2\xa0 And we have, again, a number of different ways in which Internet questions have been coming in that the President can then answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be able to answer those questions live and unfiltered?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Not -- no.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\'d never do that -- I mean, not in the sense that a question is popping up on a screen in front of the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, will the Chinese people be able to hear his answers?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Oh, well, we know what we can do, right?\xc2\xa0 So what we will do is we will stream the event live on WhiteHouse.gov, which is an accessible Web site to anybody with an Internet connection in China, which is hundreds of millions, I think.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the largest Internet-using country in the world.\xc2\xa0 So the portion that we control, which is our Web site, we will certainly be live-streaming the event.\xc2\xa0 China -- as to what the Chinese will do, we\'ll see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President will be able to go around the room, calling at random on people as will?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 It will be a format of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Boy-girl-boy-girl.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 You know, you\'ve seen it -- yes, exactly.</p>\n<p>The President will deliver brief opening remarks -- 10 to 15 minutes.\xc2\xa0 Then he\'ll take questions from -- he\'ll be calling on people in the room.\xc2\xa0 And among -- within that format, there will be questions that have come in via the Internet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That will be broadcast on Shanghai TV?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve heard that, so -- I\'ve heard that.\xc2\xa0 I believe that\'s right.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll -- we\'d like to reach the broadest possible audience.\xc2\xa0 We\'re live-streaming it on WhiteHouse.gov, and we\'ll see how widely it\'s broadcast in other media.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t4:51 P.M.
