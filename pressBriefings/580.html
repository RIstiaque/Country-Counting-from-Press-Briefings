Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:10 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Very quiet this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I apologize for my tardiness.\xc2\xa0 I cannot use sleep deprivation as an excuse like so many of my colleagues can today who returned from a very eventful and short trip to South Africa earlier this morning.</p>\n<p>Before we get started, I do have a quick announcement that I want to echo that you may have heard a little bit about already.\xc2\xa0 Today, the Department of Health and Human Services reported that the number of people who enrolled in federally run marketplaces in November was more than four times October\xe2\x80\x99s enrollment -- evidence of technical improvements that were made to healthcare.gov.</p>\n<p>Today, we\xe2\x80\x99re also highlighting the investments made by the Affordable Care Act to expand access to high-quality health care for millions of Americans by strengthening community health centers across the country.\xc2\xa0 For more than 45 years, community health centers have delivered comprehensive, high-quality, preventative and primary health care to patients.\xc2\xa0 Today, approximately 1,200 health centers operate more than 9,000 service delivery sites that provide care to more than 21 million patients across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Health centers are also an integral source of local employment and economic growth in many communities.\xc2\xa0 They employ more than 148,000 workers nationwide and added more than 35,000 jobs over the last four years.\xc2\xa0 As community-based organizations, health centers are well positioned to play a vital role in providing health care to their communities as millions more Americans begin gaining health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>To help expand the capacity of health centers to provide health care, the Affordable Care Act includes approximately $11 billion for efforts to strengthen and grow our community health centers, including by establishing new sites, renovating existing health centers, and hiring more staff.\xc2\xa0 This is one of the many ways the Affordable Care Act is expanding access to quality health care for people across the country.</p>\n<p>So with that important announcement, Mr. Kuhnhenn, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you get started today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A couple of those health numbers -- although that\xe2\x80\x99s I believe more than three times the October total -- it\xe2\x80\x99s still one-third of the 1.2 million that the administration originally planned to have by the end of November.\xc2\xa0 And today, Secretary Sebelius said that the backend of the system, that part of the system that pays insurers and assesses what the -- figures out what the tax subsidies will be, won\xe2\x80\x99t be ready until mid-January.\xc2\xa0 So can the administration guarantee that anybody who wants to have insurance on January 1st will be able to get it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If they sign up by December 23rd -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the deadline that\xe2\x80\x99s been put in place for individuals who would like to be covered by January 1st -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the deadline that they have to meet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And everybody who wants to sign up by January 23rd -- or by December 23rd will be able to?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly, as you know, Jim, have added significant capacity to the website where we can handle much higher traffic to the website to accommodate the interest of people all across the country.\xc2\xa0 There have been some numbers that have been provided by CMS that indicate that the traffic to the website has spiked after reports that it was functioning smoothly for the vast majority of users.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that\xe2\x80\x99s there\xe2\x80\x99s strong interest all across the country on behalf of people who are interested in getting access to the affordable health care coverage that is now available through healthcare.gov.</p>\n<p>So the improvements to the website allow us to accommodate more traffic and accommodate the significant interest that\xe2\x80\x99s out there.\xc2\xa0 And according to the numbers that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from HHS that were released today, there is a significant increase in the number of people who are actually following through and enrolling.\xc2\xa0 Now, the numbers that were released today all predate the most important and most tangible of the improvements to the website.\xc2\xa0 So it is reasonable to assume -- while I can\xe2\x80\x99t provide you specific data -- that the number of people who are enrolling in health care over the last 10 days since the improvements to the website were implemented, that there are more people signing up.</p>\n<p>So the trajectory is moving in the right direction and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by.\xc2\xa0 But there also is this lingering problem, that I think that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to, that relates to the so-called 834 forms, which is the information being accurately conveyed from the website to the individual insurer who would be providing the insurance.\xc2\xa0 And there are a range of fixes that have been put in place to iron out the kinks in that process, and they have made tremendous progress in eliminating some of those problems.\xc2\xa0 And they also have in place a system for going back and confirming that individuals who signed up very early on in the first six or eight weeks, when they were having the most problems with the 834 program, to confirm essentially on both sides -- both with the insurance company and with the individual -- that both sides have done what they need to do to ensure that that person is covered and will be covered as of January 1st.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we are confident that we have put in place the kind of solutions that are required to confirm that individuals who sign up and enroll in a health care plan by December 23rd will be in a position to have that coverage take effect on January 1st.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a separate issue, reports today that the U.S. has halted all nonlethal aid to Syrian rebels operating in northern Syria -- I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is the U.S. losing faith in the ability of rebels to fight without Islamic extremist interference or participation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, as you know, a significant portion of our policy towards Syria has been dedicated to providing support to those elements of the opposition that are moderate, that are committed to respecting basic human rights, that are committed to respecting the rights of religious and ethnic minorities and even the political minorities in that country.\xc2\xa0 So that has been a focal point of our efforts, particularly when it comes to the provision of nonlethal aid.</p>\n<p>We have seen the reports that Islamic Front forces have seized the headquarters in question and warehouses belonging to the Supreme Military Council, and we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously concerned by those reports.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still gathering facts and consulting with General Idris and the Supreme Military Council staff to inventory the status of U.S. equipment and supplies that have been provided to the SMC.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As a result of this situation, as you pointed out, the United States has suspended all further deliveries of nonlethal assistance into northern Syria.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand that our humanitarian assistance, which is distributed through international and nongovernmental organizations including the United Nations, is not affected by this suspension.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is this in effect weakening the military opposition to Assad?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we are interested in doing is trying to coordinate with and lift up the moderate elements of the opposition, and that has been a challenge from the very beginning -- both to identify the moderate elements of the opposition and to provide them the support that they need to try to bring about the kind of transition that reflects the will of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 That has been a challenging proposition from the very beginning and that continues to be challenging.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last, can you comment on the reports that the sign language interpreter that stood next to the President yesterday was apparently a fake?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports -- I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the South African government about who that person was and what their responsibilities were.\xc2\xa0 I think my only reaction to that is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame that you had a service that was dedicated to honoring the life and celebrating the legacy of one of the great leaders of the 20th century has gotten distracted by this and a couple of other issues that are far less important than the legacy of Nelson Mandela.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any security concerns?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with the Secret Service to see if they had any concerns?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re ultimately responsible for the President\xe2\x80\x99s security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, all right, Mark, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you the next one, but anybody in the back, I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at you next.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The budget deal announced last night did not include an extension of unemployment insurance, emergency unemployment insurance benefits.\xc2\xa0 Could the President sign a budget deal without those?\xc2\xa0 How does he intend to push forward to get something that he has said is a priority for him?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement last night indicated that he was pleased with the budget agreement that was reached between Senator Murray and Chairman Ryan, and that is an indication that the President would sign that agreement if it passes both the House and the Senate, which is what we expect.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of unemployment benefits, the President feels strongly that those unemployment benefits should be extended.\xc2\xa0 There is a very persuasive humanitarian case, if you will:\xc2\xa0 There are 1.3 million Americans right now who stand to lose their unemployment benefits if Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t act by December 28th.\xc2\xa0 That obviously is a terrible circumstance.\xc2\xa0 It also has significant consequences for our broader economy that some analysts have found that the extension of emergency unemployment benefits would actually provide a significant boost to our economy, or at least a perceptible boost to our economy, in the form of creating about 240,000 jobs, having a positive impact on GDP on the order of two- or three- or four-tenths of a percent.</p>\n<p>So the President will continue to advocate for this.\xc2\xa0 There have been a few previous occasions where we\xe2\x80\x99ve come down to the wire like this, and through the President\xe2\x80\x99s cajoling and advocating we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten some congressional action.\xc2\xa0 It remains to be seen if that will happen in this case, but that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that we\xe2\x80\x99re advocating for.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about quite a bit.\xc2\xa0 There was a report from the Council of Economic Advisors last week on this.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s weekly address just this past Saturday was on this topic.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that the President believes is a priority both for the economy, but also for the 1.36 million Americans who stand to lose their unemployment benefits during the holiday season.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House has remained somewhat in the background in these budget talks compared with previous rounds of budget negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s sense that by remaining somewhat in the background, you\xe2\x80\x99ve lowered the temperature of these talks and thus contributed to the success of getting an agreement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of sort of divining all of the different influences in that process, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that to you guys.\xc2\xa0 What I think is important about this process is that we saw a genuine commitment from leaders in both parties to the regular order budget process.\xc2\xa0 We saw a lot of lip service paid to that notion in previous years, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just in the last couple of months that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a commitment on both sides to that regular order budget process.\xc2\xa0 That means that you essentially had the budget leadership on the Senate side and the budget leadership on the House side get together in bipartisan fashion and hash through these issues, and do it in a way that leads to a vehicle for genuine legislative action that actually addresses some of the problems.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All of that was done in consultation with the White House -- that senior White House officials were involved in those conversations.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately this was an agreement that had to be struck between the leaders of the House and the leaders of the Senate.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the way the Founding Fathers designed the system to work, and we\xe2\x80\x99re gratified that they have reached a bipartisan agreement that is good for the economy.</p>\n<p>I mean, look, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of time over the last several years talking about budget agreements and trying to find common ground and striking bipartisan compromises.\xc2\xa0 The way that the President routinely evaluates these kinds of budget agreements is by taking a look at the impact that it would have on our economy.\xc2\xa0 And there are two important ways that this budget agreement has a positive impact on our economy.</p>\n<p>The first is that it does repeal parts of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 The sequester was a significant drag on our economy over the course of the last year, and the President is pleased that Congress will be taking away at least some of that drag.\xc2\xa0 And it will give us the opportunity to invest in the kinds of things that are so important to our long-term economic growth.\xc2\xa0 Particularly early childhood education, Head Start programs stand to benefit from this.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also the possibility of restoring some funding to research and development, which the President thinks is so critical to our economy.\xc2\xa0 So taking away some aspect of the sequester is a positive step.</p>\n<p>The other thing that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing -- and this is something that, again, that people who have stood at this podium have expressed concerns about -- is this propensity that Congress has had lately to lurch from one crisis to another.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, Congress is able to reach what even I would describe as a modest agreement.\xc2\xa0 But they were able to reach that modest, bipartisan agreement without the threat of a crisis, without a threat of default, without the threat of a government shutdown, but by working through the regular order, by identifying some common ground and striking an agreement.\xc2\xa0 That is going to be -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not just good for the political process, and might restore some faith in the ability of the United States Congress to actually get good things done on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 It will also provide some certainty to the private sector.\xc2\xa0 This is something that Republicans have said is really important for our economy; the President agrees.\xc2\xa0 And that is another way in which our economy will benefit from what is a modest but important budget agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jumping to an international issue, there\xe2\x80\x99s renewed violence in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 In spite of the White House and U.S. condemnations of past instances of violence, the violence seems to continue.\xc2\xa0 What leverage does the United States have to try to calm things down there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do have some prepared comment on this, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start with that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to your direct question:\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The United States was appalled last night by what happened in Kiev.\xc2\xa0 The Ukrainian government\xe2\x80\x99s response to peaceful protests over the last two weeks has been completely unacceptable, and it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to understand why they have decided to move against their own people repeatedly with force rather than engage in a real dialogue with the opposition.\xc2\xa0 The right to peaceful protest and assembly must be respected.\xc2\xa0 Violence of the sort that we have seen on the streets of Kiev is impermissible in a democratic state.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also very concerned by credible reports of security services raiding the offices of opposition parties and media organizations in the last few days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Political repression is not the way to respond to the legitimate grievances of the Ukrainian people.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden urged President Yanukovych in a Monday phone call to avoid violence and immediately take steps to deescalate the situation.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s clearly not done that.\xc2\xa0 This is President Yanukovych\xe2\x80\x99s moment to meet the aspirations of the Ukrainian people or disappoint them.\xc2\xa0 It is past time for the leadership in Ukraine to listen to the voices of its people and to restore a path to European integration and economic health.</p>\n<p>It is fair to say that the lines of communication between this administration and the leadership in Ukraine remain open.\xc2\xa0 And I think the sentiments that I have just read to you also reflect broadly the opinions of the international community.\xc2\xa0 And there is a pretty clear choice it\'s facing, the Ukrainian government right now.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re hopeful that they will choose a path that reflects the will of the Ukrainian people and reflects an opportunity for reconciliation, and to restore some civility and peacefulness to that dispute and hopefully find a way to resolve that dispute peacefully.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can just follow up on one thing that I asked about earlier.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner has apparently said today that he has not seen an acceptable plan from the White House to extend long-term unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 Can you respond to that?\xc2\xa0 Has the President made a proposal?\xc2\xa0 If not, why not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 A specific or detailed proposal in this case probably isn\'t required.\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking about extending a program that has been in place for several years now.\xc2\xa0 It was originally signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2008.\xc2\xa0 It\'s been extended at least a couple of times in the last few years.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re simply seeking to see that program extended in the same way that it has been in the past by this Congress.</p>\n<p>As I pointed out earlier, there are important consequences for 1.3 million Americans who are at risk of losing their unemployment benefits in just a couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 And there are important consequences from our economy that would benefit from the extension of this program.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s what we\'re hopeful that Congress will do.</p>\n<p>Let\'s go to the back here a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, we\'re expecting the next -- I know we just got the most recent numbers, but the next numbers middle of January.\xc2\xa0 Will we get any report about the population of people who have signed up -- who have gotten in under the December 23rd deadline, since obviously that population will be transmitted to the insurers?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And you\'re asking?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we get that information around Christmas?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What kind of information?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The population of people who have signed up in advance of December 23rd for January 1 benefits.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And so you\'re asking if we\'ll have a list before January 1st of the people who have signed up by December 23rd?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or January 15th or January 11th.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would not anticipate additional enrollment numbers until the middle of January, which has been our custom these last couple of months.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s when I would anticipate you\'d get that additional data.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the sign language question, I know that you said that -- referred it to the South African government.\xc2\xa0 But if the President had been translated into another language incorrectly, another audible language incorrectly, wouldn\'t that have been a breach of protocol?\xc2\xa0 Would we have not seen a different reaction from the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 It\'s difficult to evaluate for two reasons.\xc2\xa0 One is maybe he was translated incorrectly in some other language in his speech yesterday and we don\'t know about it.\xc2\xa0 That possibility does exist.</p>\n<p>Secondly, it\'s not clear to me that this person mistranslated the President at all.\xc2\xa0 I think the point is, is that he apparently was not translating him into anything, but was enjoying the opportunity to be on the stage.\xc2\xa0 So it makes it difficult to answer your question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And it\'s why I\'ve referred the question to the South African government.</p>\n<p>But, again, at the same time, this was an historic event in which the President delivered some very powerful remarks about the personal impact that President Mandela had on his own life and his own commitment to public service.</p>\n<p>He talked pretty eloquently, I think, about the impact that President Mandela had on democratic movements all across the globe, and it would be a shame if a distraction about an individual who\xe2\x80\x99s on stage in any way detracted from the importance of that event and the importance of President Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s legacy.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Josh, I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up first on the question of the budget.\xc2\xa0 If the President signs, as he indicated he\xe2\x80\x99d like to, the Murray-Ryan deal, does that become the President\xe2\x80\x99s template for his budget submission in February?\xc2\xa0 What does he do with that in his own budget for the coming cycle?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to get ahead of the budget process.\xc2\xa0 As you would expect, this is something that involves a lot of planning and a lot of technical expertise to design a budget submission that reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy priorities.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of this process.</p>\n<p>But suffice it to say the President is pleased that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to find some common ground as it relates to this interim budget agreement that sets some parameters for what the budget will look like in Fiscal Year 2014 and Fiscal Year 2015, and therefore provide some stability and certainty for the private sector.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that one question, would we expect the President to take that forward and say, I\xe2\x80\x99m signing this but I\xe2\x80\x99d still like to get rid of sequestration over a 10-year period?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that our budget proposal will include some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s own ideas about the investments that are so critical for us to make to strengthen our economy, to expand economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Those ideas will be reflected in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, second question -- can you clarify why Mr. Podesta, who is coming in as a counselor next year, would feel the need to recuse himself, as been reported in AP, on Keystone when all of us in this room know that John, as being so linked with CAP, has many very known public views on many, many policies?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He does.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you asked this question because I do want to take advantage of this opportunity to clarify something that leaked out late overnight.\xc2\xa0 The word \xe2\x80\x9crecuse\xe2\x80\x9d here is not the right word, right?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no suggestion of some sort of conflict of interest, financial or otherwise, as it relates to Mr. Podesta\xe2\x80\x99s opinions, views and positions on the Keystone pipeline.\xc2\xa0 So \xe2\x80\x9crecuse\xe2\x80\x9d is not the right word.</p>\n<p>What is true is that Mr. Podesta approached Denis McDonough, the Chief of Staff, and suggested to him that Mr. Podesta shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work on the policy-making process related to the Keystone pipeline.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that -- there are a couple of reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 The first is this is a policy process that looks at the State Department right now, not at the White House, and Mr. Podesta is coming to work at the White House, not the State Department.\xc2\xa0 The second thing is this a policy process that\xe2\x80\x99s been in place for several years now, and having him enter that process at the very end or near the very end doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be the best way to carry out that process and to move it across the finish line.\xc2\xa0 The third thing -- and this is important, too, and it relates to the subject of your question -- his views on this are well known.\xc2\xa0 But there are people who have been working on this for a number of years and who are looking at this from a variety of perspectives, and want to make sure that this policy outcome reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s views and can approach it in an impartial way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The comments and views that Mr. Podesta has expressed have been done without the benefit of -- or without the reality of him working directly for the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 So in this case, he felt it was most appropriate to basically send a signal early on that this is not something that would be part of his portfolio.\xc2\xa0 He communicated that desire to Mr. McDonough, and Denis agreed with him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the natural follow-up then is just to say, is there any other policy terrain or topic that the President\xe2\x80\x99s incoming counselor would feel or express to the President or the Chief of Staff that he should not or does not want to work on?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of right now.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The health care law succeeding sort of depends on about 2.6, 2.7 million young, healthy people signing up by April 1st.\xc2\xa0 Do you have those figures -- how many of those people have signed up to date?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is also a question -- you and Alexis must be coordinating, because this is the second question in a row that I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to have the opportunity to talk about -- because it is important for people to understand that as they evaluate the Affordable Care Act, that measuring the success of that program cannot simply be done based on the number of people who have signed up.\xc2\xa0 It would be nice if the world worked in that simple of a fashion.\xc2\xa0 It simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I understand the desire for people to want to try to reduce the metric to a simple number related to people who have enrolled in health care.\xc2\xa0 But that will not determine the success or failure of the Affordable Care Act and the exchanges that are set up -- the marketplaces that are set up under the rubric of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>What we need is the right mix of individuals in these individual exchanges.\xc2\xa0 My point is, you can\xe2\x80\x99t evaluate the success or failure of the Affordable Care Act based solely on the number of people who sign up all across the country.\xc2\xa0 What you should do to evaluate the success of the program is to consider the mix of people who have signed up in each of the individual marketplaces.\xc2\xa0 That is a task that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to reduce down to one number.\xc2\xa0 But that is the best way for you and others to evaluate the overall success of the program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What our goal is, is to sign up as many people as possible, to give as many people all across the country as possible the opportunity to go onto the website, to work with a navigator in their community, to call the 1-800 number, and to find out what options are available to them.\xc2\xa0 And many people are going to find out that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to qualify for tax credits.\xc2\xa0 Some of them will qualify for expanded Medicaid coverage.\xc2\xa0 But there are a lot of ways in which individuals will find out that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to benefit from the Affordable Care Act, and we want as many people as possible to do exactly that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And I understand that you don\'t want to give specific numbers.\xc2\xa0 But HHS last night said they\xe2\x80\x99re on track to have 7 million people sign up by April 1st.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of industry insiders have questioned that and have said the pace really needs to pick up if you\'re going to get that many people.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not dealing with the 7 million figure, does the pace need to pick up?\xc2\xa0 And can you guarantee that you\'re going to get the right mix and the right number in the end by April 1st?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we have said about the website since before the website was even rolled out was that there would not be a linear relationship between the number of days that have gone by since the website opened for business and the number of people who would sign up; that we anticipated that there would be some spikes in this process.\xc2\xa0 We anticipated, for example, that there would be a spike shortly before the deadline in which people -- that people needed to meet in order to get insurance coverage by January 1st.\xc2\xa0 That deadline has been moved to December 23rd to give more people the opportunity to sign up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we do anticipate that there will be a spike in advance of December 23rd.\xc2\xa0 For all we know, there is a spike going on right now.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s because of -- that\'s simply ascribable to nothing other than human nature, that we have -- that we\'re compelled to take action when we get close to a deadline.\xc2\xa0 So I would anticipate that we\'ll see another spike in mid-March before the deadline for the open enrollment period expires.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ve always anticipated that there will be spikes in this process, that there would be more traffic and a greater rate of enrollment at certain periods than others.</p>\n<p>So that\'s why it\'s difficult to assess exactly what we\'re on pace for.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you, though -- let me just say one last thing, which is because of the improvements we\'ve made to the website, we now have the bandwidth to accommodate about 800,000 or a million people a day to visit the website.\xc2\xa0 And that means that there should be ample opportunity for people who are interested in this program to go check it out for themselves.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to be clear, these figures that you\'ve put out today are the number of people who have signed up, not actually enrolled?\xc2\xa0 In other words, not necessarily sent in their checks and finished with the entire process?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that they actually provided two different numbers along these lines -- didn\'t they?\xc2\xa0 Let me take a look here.\xc2\xa0 I think they did put out enrollment numbers.\xc2\xa0 They said that 365,000 people through November had enrolled.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have actually sent in their checks, finished?\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that they have enrolled, that they have committed -- that they have signed up for a proposal.\xc2\xa0 I think the payment option is something that is responsible for the individual insurance companies to execute.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the enrollment, that they have made a commitment and that they have selected a plan that they like and would allow them to get coverage by January 1st if they\'ve done it obviously in October or November.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I just get you to respond -- or does the President have any response to these latest poll numbers, which show his lowest -- or his highest disapproval ratings ever?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel like it\'s time for a reset?\xc2\xa0 Is that part of the reason for bringing in Podesta?\xc2\xa0 How does he view those?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 To be honest with you, we don\'t spend a lot of time looking at these individual poll numbers.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve heard us say that both when the numbers are good and when the numbers aren\'t as good, as was suggested by at least one poll today.\xc2\xa0 I know there\'s another poll that suggested something different.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the fact of the matter is what we\'ve been looking at, and I think what I would encourage you to consider, is that while your poll was in the field, there were some important priorities that we made progress on.\xc2\xa0 Mel Watt got confirmed to be the director of the FHFA.\xc2\xa0 Patricia Millett got confirmed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals -- right?\xc2\xa0 The Volcker Rule got voted on and approved, and is now being implemented -- something that six months ago you guys thought I was crazy if I had suggested the Volcker Rule would be done by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 We even got a budget agreement through the Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So these are the kinds of priorities that we\'re focused on.\xc2\xa0 And all these things happened just yesterday at the same time that you were announcing the results of your poll.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s what we\'re focused on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fair enough.\xc2\xa0 But the poll shows that his signature piece of legislation is health care law.\xc2\xa0 It\'s part of the key reason that these numbers are so low.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, the truth is, Kristen, you could say that any time over the last three years when it comes to these polls.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that the President has pursued the difficult topic of health care reform not because it would burnish his poll numbers, but because he thought it was the right thing for the country; that it would expand affordable, quality health care to millions of Americans who currently don\'t have it; and it would also do really good things for our economy in terms of expanding economic opportunity and creating jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\'s the reason that we\'ve pursued health care reform, and that\'s the reason that we\'re working so doggedly to implement it in a way that will maximize the benefits for people all across the country in spite of the poll numbers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Viqueira.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Two questions -- both foreign and domestic.\xc2\xa0 First, Kathleen Sebelius today announced that she has asked the IG over at HHS to investigate what happened with the website.\xc2\xa0 I mean, presumably, the IG, who is after all supposed to be independent of what Kathleen Sebelius wants or doesn\'t want, is going to do that himself.\xc2\xa0 Is that adequate?\xc2\xa0 Is that enough?\xc2\xa0 Should there be more?\xc2\xa0 Should heads roll?\xc2\xa0 Should there be further investigation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that there were -- the reason I\'m looking at my notebook is because there were a couple of other things that she announced.\xc2\xa0 She did ask the Inspector General to take a look at the process related to the development of healthcare.gov and to examine the mistakes that occurred and to offer up some solutions and some suggestions for how to improve that process moving forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are a couple of other steps that she announced today.\xc2\xa0 She also announced that she had directed the CMS Administrator, Marilyn Tavenner, to create a new position and appoint a CMS chief risk officer, who will focus on mitigating risk across CMS\'s programs, to basically evaluate the ongoing progress or lack thereof of CMS programs, and to try to intervene before they result in significant problems like the rollout of the website.</p>\n<p>She also announced a new training regime that would update and expand the training process to give CMS employees more information about best practices for contractor and procurement management rules and procedures.</p>\n<p>So there are a number of things that the Secretary announced today that would address some of the problems that were exposed by the healthcare.gov website rollout.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that if there are other ideas that she has about what we can do to strengthen the process, the internal processes over at HHS, that she\xe2\x80\x99ll propose those, too.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that this is the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate more actions to be taken?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would leave open that possibility.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know of anything else that\'s planned right now, but I certainly would leave open that possibility.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And back on Syria, just to follow up, nonlethal aid -- I mean, a lot was made about lethal aid finally being sent after the chemical attack.\xc2\xa0 Why is this moratorium only on nonlethal aid?\xc2\xa0 What about lethal aid?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, for questions about that I think I\xe2\x80\x99d actually refer you to my colleagues at the national security staff.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have details about any changes to other assistance that might have been provided by the administration.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on that question that Mike was asking about accountability with Secretary Sebelius -- on the Podesta hire, you\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously added him, you\xe2\x80\x99ve added Phil Schiliro as well, a familiar face around here.\xc2\xa0 But is the President planning to subtract anyone from the equation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any personnel announcements at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t -- I mean, I realize you don\'t have them at this moment, but you don\'t expect -- as the end of the year comes, you don\'t expect there will be any changes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it is -- having covered us for the last five years, Ed, you\xe2\x80\x99re aware that the end of the year is a traditional time for people to make some decisions about their own personal lives and to make decisions to leave the administration and pursue other opportunities.\xc2\xa0 That also means that people from the outside are brought into the White House during that period.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that something like that is probably going to happen again around the end of this year and the beginning of next, but that is not a -- that is neither a commendation or a condemnation of their performance at the White House at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Kristen\xe2\x80\x99s question about polls -- I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you referenced that you don\'t look at any individual polls, because I checked the gaggle on November 25th and you said the same about a poll that day that said that 53 percent of the public -- I think it was a CNN poll -- thought the President was not trustworthy.\xc2\xa0 And you said you don\'t follow the ups and downs, but you\'re looking at \xe2\x80\x9cthe broader trends.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So since November 25th, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a fair number of polls that suggest a trend that the President\xe2\x80\x99s honesty, trustworthiness has taken a hit -- in a whole range of polls.\xc2\xa0 Will you at least acknowledge that the health care issue has damaged the President\xe2\x80\x99s credibility?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I agree with that conclusion.\xc2\xa0 I recognize that there may be some polling evidence to indicate that, but just looking at polls I don\'t think gives you a very good read about what the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities are.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think it gives you a very good --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the public\xe2\x80\x99s mood -- not his priorities -- but what the public thinks about.\xc2\xa0 The NBC/Wall Street Journal poll says a lot of people -- I think it was 75 percent -- think the economy is either going to be as good or better next year.\xc2\xa0 That\'s good for the President.\xc2\xa0 And yet, they\'re not giving him credit for that and saying that -- his disapproval has reached a new high.\xc2\xa0 Not about his priorities, but the public\xe2\x80\x99s mood seems to be very sour on him.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it is perfectly legitimate for your news organization and others to consider all of the public data out there and to draw assessments about what the public mood is.\xc2\xa0 I think that is a perfectly legitimate enterprise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think I\xe2\x80\x99m just making the case to you that that\'s not what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on, that there are a variety of other policy priorities that the President believes is more important than trying to figure out within a particular statistical confidence interval what his polling numbers are.\xc2\xa0 So what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now is the President\xe2\x80\x99s core priorities related to expanding economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And if we can make progress by extending emergency unemployment benefits, if we can raise the minimum wage, if we can put in place policies that will ensure that every child in America has access to a quality early childhood education program, that those are the kinds of things that are going to have a material difference on our economy.\xc2\xa0 And if we can make progress on those priorities, the poll numbers are going to take care of themselves.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other quick things.\xc2\xa0 On the website, at the top, in responding to Jim, you were saying that if anyone signs up by December 23rd, they will be \xe2\x80\x9cin a position to get insurance.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But his question was, are you guaranteeing that they will get it -- not that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a position to get it -- but if you sign up by December 23rd, are you guaranteeing you\xe2\x80\x99ll have insurance on January 1?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is the deadline that we have established for individuals -- that if people who sign up on December 23rd, that that\xe2\x80\x99s what they need you to do in order to qualify for insurance coverage by January 1st.\xc2\xa0 We have individuals who are -- we have a team of experts, actually, more than just individuals, these are experts who are in place to make sure that the proper linkages are connected between the insurance companies and the individuals who are enrolled.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee them.\xc2\xa0 People are trying, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee them.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We are confident that by December 23rd we\xe2\x80\x99ll have ironed out these problems.\xc2\xa0 And Mr. Zients himself has said that we are confident that past and future 834 issues will be resolved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very last thing on the budget today -- you said the President is pleased with it; he put out on a statement to that effect.\xc2\xa0 Paul Ryan, though, is touting the fact that he says that it sets a new precedent.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s all spending cuts for the deficit reduction, no tax increases.\xc2\xa0 The President ran in the last campaign, as you know better than anyone, on saying there has to be a balanced approach -- that\xe2\x80\x99s his guiding principle.\xc2\xa0 He won the election and said that\xe2\x80\x99s how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it.\xc2\xa0 Paul Ryan says now there\xe2\x80\x99s a new deal -- it\xe2\x80\x99s spending cuts, no tax increases.\xc2\xa0 So does that suggest his guiding principle is no longer valid?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does not.\xc2\xa0 The President continues to be\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well then why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he get it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me answer your first question, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to your second one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is committed to a balanced approach, and that is something that he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to advocate for.\xc2\xa0 This deal actually does reflect a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not in a position where we\xe2\x80\x99re asking middle-class families or Medicare beneficiaries or people who rely on Social Security income to pay the bills -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to ask those people to make sacrifices if we\xe2\x80\x99re not also going to ask the oil and gas companies to make sacrifices, or for hedge fund managers to make sacrifices.</p>\n<p>So the President will continue to pursue a balanced approach to deal with our deficit challenges.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s also important as the President considers these kinds of budget agreements is he wants to make sure that the priorities that are included in these budgets reflect what should be our core priority, which is expanding economic opportunity for the middle class, and that is something that -- again, this is a modest budget agreement but it does reflect those priorities.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, the President will continue to make the case for budget agreements that are focused on middle-class priorities.\xc2\xa0 The President will also continue to make the case for tax reform that reflects middle-class priorities, and that is something that we should be able to find common ground on.\xc2\xa0 And if this is a precedent for finding common ground with Republicans, where we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- to go to your second question -- where we\xe2\x80\x99re actually going to compromise on something, where neither side is going to get everything that they want but both sides are going to be able to point to something that they think is positive about the deal, then I hope that it is a precedent.</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Following up on Alexis\xe2\x80\x99s questions, why would Mr. Podesta feel a need to, I guess, remove himself if he knows already, I assume, that the process at the State Department, it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t square?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is -- well, because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work at the State Department, I guess is the first thing, right?\xc2\xa0 So this is a process that lives there.\xc2\xa0 At some point, there will be some --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why would he need to remove himself if he is coming here?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m confused about.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Because the process will eventually shift to the White House, that there will be some White House involvement in that process.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked about that pretty extensively already.\xc2\xa0 And he felt like it was -- that it was in the best interest of that policy-making process to not insert himself and his well-known views at the very end of that process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he has no -- you said -- no financial or other conflicts of interest besides his previous stated stance --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of -- not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 But suffice it to say that Mr. Podesta like everybody else who works here will meet the most stringent ethics requirements in history that the President put in place in his first day in office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And then one other question.\xc2\xa0 I know that last week in his interview with MSNBC, the President spoke pretty glowingly of Pope Francis, and today he was named Person of the Year.\xc2\xa0 Have they spoken at all recently?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that they have, actually.\xc2\xa0 I think the President said in that interview that he had not had the chance to speak to him yet.\xc2\xa0 But I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the President\xe2\x80\x99s words stand.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke eloquently about what an important figure and what a really important message Pope Francis has sent to the world in just the six or eight months that he has held that important position in the Catholic Church.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you also argue, countering Paul Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s assessment, that the new precedent is the Budget Control Act has been rewritten, at least for two years, and that the sequestration numbers have changed and there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be more spending than there was under the past agreement that was also bipartisan and also signed by the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You guys are interested in drawing precedents here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m actually interested in looking at the impact that this budget deal will have on our economy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how the President made --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the latest deal, though.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t disagree with anything I just said, do you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to rub his nose in it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, isn\'t that the fact?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that I would.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you answer the question?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is, is that what we have reached is a compromise agreement.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly did not get everything that he would like to see in this budget agreement, and Mr. Ryan, I think as he has said a couple of times publicly now, didn\xe2\x80\x99t get everything that he wanted.\xc2\xa0 But what they were able to do was put aside those differences and focus on some common ground and strike an agreement that is in the best interests of our economy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President is pleased about.\xc2\xa0 And again, if putting aside partisan differences, focusing on common ground and demonstrating a willingness to reach a compromise, if that\xe2\x80\x99s precedent-setting, we\xe2\x80\x99re all for it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then let\xe2\x80\x99s go down that road a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Because if the precedent is to use one year or very short-term fees and other minor-league revenue increases, and adjust spending upward, this seems to be not a small step toward a grand bargain, but a complete step in the opposite direction.\xc2\xa0 Because none of the structural things are dealt with because the politics was obviously too difficult for both sides to even discuss, let alone draft.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with all of that at all.\xc2\xa0 A couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One is, I\xe2\x80\x99m not comparing this to a grand bargain at all.\xc2\xa0 The first time anybody in this room has said \xe2\x80\x9cgrand bargain\xe2\x80\x9d is when you did.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting you did.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, okay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s been the sort of overhang for all these confrontations for quite some time.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It has, it has.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for that grand bargain continues to sit on the table for -- continues to sit on the table right now.\xc2\xa0 That is an option that is available and that has been.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re coming up on the year anniversary of that initial proposal.\xc2\xa0 It was codified in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget as well.\xc2\xa0 But what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now is trying to strike budget agreements that reflect the best interests of our economy.\xc2\xa0 It is our view that a so-called grand bargain, based on the outlines that the President has put forward, would actually do really good things for our economy.\xc2\xa0 A more modest agreement, like the one that was reached just yesterday, would also do helpful things for our economy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is pleased --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or less harm.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m a glass half-full kind of guy, Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you demand also a resolution for the same period of time, or at least another period of time, on the debt ceiling?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the fact of the matter is Senator McConnell has been pretty outspoken ever since the end of the government shutdown back in October that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be in a position, that Republicans are not going to be part of holding the economy hostage and not going to be part of threatening default.\xc2\xa0 And we at the White House are confident that Senator McConnell is right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you think you can deal with that?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not an issue anymore?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the Congress to deal with it, and we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that they will without any drama.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Let me just put two things together that you said about December 23rd, January 1st coverage, and what Secretary Sebelius testified to.\xc2\xa0 Because I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a fundamental disconnect there.\xc2\xa0 She says the backend of the website -- which is the part through which insurers are paid and guaranteed payment is confirmed -- won\xe2\x80\x99t be done until mid-January.\xc2\xa0 How can you so assertively predict with confidence that those who sign up on December 23rd will have actionable coverage on January 1st?\xc2\xa0 Because they have to -- as every customer does, has to go through the backend system.\xc2\xa0 I mean, are you literally going to have people sort of monitoring everyone who falls into that category of December 23rd and January 1st coverage?\xc2\xa0 Because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how they don\xe2\x80\x99t slip through the cracks.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me unpack a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 Because I was getting ready for this briefing, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to watch every minute of her testimony.\xc2\xa0 My understanding, though, about those references to some aspects of the backend needing to be fixed or still need to be built, that relates to several other processes related to health care -- not necessarily to this one 834 issue.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing.</p>\n<p>But the second thing is that the problems that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with that program were much worse very early on.\xc2\xa0 So in October and November, we saw that the 834s were not functioning and not being transmitted with a lot of accuracy, that there were concerns about information being left off the forms, that there were duplicates being sent.\xc2\xa0 Because of some of the technological fixes that have been implemented over the course of the month of November, a lot of those problems -- I guess I should say this:\xc2\xa0 The rate of those problems has dropped significantly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So now, at the same time, there also were many fewer people who are enrolling in health care because of the problems related the website.\xc2\xa0 So the universe of people who are -- who could potentially be affected by some of the 834 problems is relatively small.\xc2\xa0 And we have a team of experts who is working both through technological fixes, but also through some elbow grease, going through and confirming that that information has been conveyed accurately and completely, and to confirm that they will be signed up for health care and eligible to get covered on January 1st.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Jared\xe2\x80\x99s first question.\xc2\xa0 It seems amazing to me that you will not and HHS will not commit to as thorough as possible a discussion of these numbers on January 1st or very soon thereafter.\xc2\xa0 Because that is your very first actual acid test of numbers and people who sought coverage and obtained it.\xc2\xa0 And is the entire country and those consumers themselves going to have to wait until the middle of January to find out if it all worked?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, those consumers individually will know whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re signed up because they\xe2\x80\x99ll --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why not tell us?\xc2\xa0 Because then you\'ll know, as well.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- have signed up by December 3rd.\xc2\xa0 We will tell you as soon as we can, and I think waiting a couple of weeks to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve scrubbed the numbers and got that information accurate, that we have ensured that there are no duplicates involved.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also compiling information from 14 different state-run exchanges.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also compiling information that didn\xe2\x80\x99t just go through the website, but also went through either in-person signups or through the call centers.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of ways that people can sign up.</p>\n<p>So compiling all that information, scrubbing it, deduping it, making sure that that information is accurate, considering the numbers that we\xe2\x80\x99re expecting, that the fact that that process might take 10 or 15 days I don\xe2\x80\x99t think is an inordinate period of time for you to wait and be able to evaluate what kind of progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made, and to evaluate the success of the program.</p>\n<p>Ari.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have to confess I was not confused about Podesta recusing himself from Keystone until you described the reasons for it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So you say he asked to recuse, but not exactly recused himself, because it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s not say \xe2\x80\x9crecuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That he said that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work on it.\xc2\xa0 But go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s at State, not at the White House --- which sort of raises the question, then why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he recuse -- excuse himself from everything that\xe2\x80\x99s handled at every agency outside the White House -- but fine, at the end of the process you say it\xe2\x80\x99s going to come to the White House, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to insert himself at the end of the process, but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come to the White House yet, so everybody at the White House would be uncertain of themselves at the end of the process.\xc2\xa0 So that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really make sense.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to understand the reasons.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take one more run at trying to explain it to you.\xc2\xa0 Put simply, this is a process that is run by the State Department right now.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, White House officials are aware of where we are in that process.\xc2\xa0 They have been consulting with people at the State Department about that process.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, that is a process that is run by the State Department.\xc2\xa0 The President has indicated how strongly he -- has indicated his interest in this program, in the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- or this determination in the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s resolved.\xc2\xa0 So the White House is in the loop as this process moves forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What Mr. Podesta has simply said is that he has very well-known views on this topic.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been publicly expressed.\xc2\xa0 Those views were publicly expressed before he started working for the President.\xc2\xa0 And so it is his view that it is better if his well-known views are not injected at the very end of that process.\xc2\xa0 So he has said to Mr. McDonough that he would prefer not to work on that process and to state so publicly, and Mr. McDonough agreed that that was the best course of action.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that still leaves the original question unanswered of why, given the wide range of things he\xe2\x80\x99s expressed views on, he would ask not to be involved in only this one.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I guess because this is a view that is -- these are views that have been strongly expressed and have gotten a lot of attention.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that he\xe2\x80\x99s expressed his views on a range of other things, too.\xc2\xa0 Many of those things are, frankly, less controversial and have become -- aren\xe2\x80\x99t as much of a lightning rod as this particular issue has become.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I also ask you about Podesta?\xc2\xa0 This administration for a long time has been criticized as too insular.\xc2\xa0 The President was asked about it in his last lengthy news conference.\xc2\xa0 Does bringing in Podesta in some way acknowledge that insularity was in fact a problem?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that might be reading too much into one man\xe2\x80\x99s hiring.\xc2\xa0 I think the reason that I can state definitively that the reason that Mr. Podesta was hired was because the President has confidence in him as a political professional, somebody who has been through some very difficult political fights, but also somebody who knows a lot about moving policy in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mr. Podesta is somebody who, as is known from his outspoken views on some issues, shares the President\xe2\x80\x99s worldview and shares the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities on a range of issues, including trying to address this question of economic mobility and economic inequality in this country.\xc2\xa0 So he is somebody who shares the President\xe2\x80\x99s worldview and is looking forward to rolling up his sleeves and working with the President to try to make progress on some of these issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The last thing is that Mr. Podesta has very strong relationships with people on Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got strong relationships with many of you in the news media.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got strong relationships with other influential people in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 And so could he contribute to trying to make sure that outside opinions are reflected in the White House\xe2\x80\x99s internal decision-making process?\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think that he can play a role in doing exactly that.\xc2\xa0 And maybe that does address some of the concerns that some have expressed about insularity at the White House, but I can tell you that the responsibility that Mr. Podesta will wield at the White House is much greater than that.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even going to ask about Keystone, but what\xe2\x80\x99s taking so long for this decision?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, this has been going on for years.\xc2\xa0 Why are we still --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It has.\xc2\xa0 Well, there have been a couple of times where the process got upended because of concerns that were raised by the Republican governor of Nebraska and the route that had been proposed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s ancient history, too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, but you said it\xe2\x80\x99s going on for years, and that\'s one of the things that slowed down the process.\xc2\xa0 So I think that demonstrates the commitment of the administration to get this right.\xc2\xa0 It demonstrates that there are people in both parties who have a range of views on this topic.\xc2\xa0 And what the State Department is doing is they\'re reaching a determination of national interest.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this a pocket veto?\xc2\xa0 Is this basically like run out the clock?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not something that should be taken lightly.\xc2\xa0 It certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t taken lightly by the President or his administration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not running out the clock?\xc2\xa0 Because if you delay and then you don\xe2\x80\x99t make a decision, it doesn\'t get built, you know?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not how I\xe2\x80\x99d characterize the ongoing policy process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I wanted ask about was the famous handshake with Raul Castro.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- we all saw the President exchanged some words with Castro.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what those words were, and did the name Alan Gross, the American political prisoner being held in Cuba, come up?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding -- I obviously wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why I\xe2\x80\x99m not sleep deprived today.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding, based on people who did talk to the President after his speech, that they didn\'t have a robust, substantive conversation about policies, but rather exchanged some pleasantries as the President was making his way to the podium.\xc2\xa0 So there was not an opportunity for the President to chronicle his many concerns about human rights abuses on the island of<br/>\n\tCuba.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President did not have the opportunity to say to him directly something that he said many times, which is that Alan Gross should be released.\xc2\xa0 So they did not have an opportunity to have a robust exchange of ideas.\xc2\xa0 Rather, they had an opportunity to exchange pleasantries.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you said the President has said many times that Alan Gross should be released?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s said it before.\xc2\xa0 Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s not many times, but he has said before that Alan Gross should be released.\xc2\xa0 I think we put out a statement from the President just a couple of days ago on this topic.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what -- so I understand he\xe2\x80\x99s there, he passed -- I know this was not a prearranged handshake.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, you knew that Castro was going to be up there on that stage.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it discussed beforehand what to do when the two would inevitably come face to face?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not to my knowledge.\xc2\xa0 Not to my knowledge.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the criticism.\xc2\xa0 John McCain actually compared this to Neville Chamberlain shaking hands with Hitler.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to all that criticism, that people say that the President shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have given Castro the opportunity to have a handshake with the leader of the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, first of all, the President shook hands with everybody who was on the stage, and Mr. Castro was one of those individuals who was on the stage.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The second thing I\xe2\x80\x99d point out is, I think even in the few number of times that I\xe2\x80\x99ve stood at this podium, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked about other people who have tried to draw connections between recent political events and the terrible reign of Adolph Hitler.\xc2\xa0 That is a dangerous and usually unwise thing to do in public.</p>\n<p>The third thing I guess I would say is that there used to be a pretty important principle that originated in the Republican Party, I believe, that partisan politics should stop at the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that we did see a number of Republicans yesterday who criticized the President for a handshake at Nelson Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s funeral.\xc2\xa0 That is I think an important progression in a number of politicians\xe2\x80\x99 views on that topic.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anybody that the President would not -- is there any world leader the President would not shake hands with?\xc2\xa0 If Assad had been on that stage, Kim Jong-un had been on that stage -- I mean, is there -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to gauge the principle.\xc2\xa0 He shook hands with everybody on the stage.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there anybody he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult hypothetical to entertain, and I decline to do it at this point.</p>\n<p>Brianna.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 To follow on Kristen\xe2\x80\x99s question about a reset -- and I know you say you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to dwell on polls -- but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore the fact that almost an alarming number of Americans have lost confidence in President Obama and his signature achievement.\xc2\xa0 So in light of that, on a reset, is this addition -- we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the additions of John Podesta, Phil Schiliro, presumably some other folks who are in the works.\xc2\xa0 Should that be seen as a reset?\xc2\xa0 And does the President think that he needs a reset?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot in that question, so let me try to do them one at a time.\xc2\xa0 The first is, the headline from the New York Times in their poll today was that Obama sees a rebound in his approval rating.\xc2\xa0 So I recognize that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of polling data out there, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not reaching any uniformed conclusions as far as I can tell.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The second thing, in terms of the need for a reset, as you described -- I think the President has -- well, let me go back to something I said earlier before I talk about the President.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve covered us closely over the last several years and you recognize that typically at the end of the calendar year people are making their own decisions about whether they can continue to government service if they want to pursue other opportunities that might afford them the opportunity to spend some more time with their family.\xc2\xa0 So that is part of a natural transition that you see on an annual basis at the White House, and I would anticipate that you\xe2\x80\x99d see some more of that this year, too.\xc2\xa0 Many of those people will be people that did not work on -- were not involved in coding healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But in terms of the President, the President is very pleased with the performance of members of his senior team at the White House who have been working hard to advance his agenda.\xc2\xa0 And he is also excited about the prospect of bringing on somebody like Mr. Podesta who would bring a fresh perspective and a fresh set of eyes to some of the challenges that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been dealing with here for the last several years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s why Mr. Podesta is a welcome addition to the team, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why this President is looking forward to all of us hopefully getting a little time off for the holidays, but coming back at the beginning of next year hopefully a little bit more rested with his sleeves rolled up, ready to pursue an agenda that is focused on expanding economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And that will be an opportunity that the President looks forward to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On unemployment benefits, Republicans are demanding an offset to the cost of them.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like you were proposing one.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if, come January 1st, when you have over a million Americans who are set to lose their unemployment benefits, if the President will have felt that he did enough, having just talked about the need to extend them, albeit a lot, instead of looking to try to find some middle ground with Republicans.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I would point out that extending emergency unemployment benefits is something that had previously been a location of common ground, if you will.\xc2\xa0 This was a program that was originally signed into law in 2008 by President George W. Bush.\xc2\xa0 It is something that had passed the Congress with bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 When it was passed and signed into law by a Republican President, it did not include specific offsets.\xc2\xa0 There are a couple times over the last couple of years in which emergency unemployment benefits had been extended through the Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you just said you\xe2\x80\x99re not interested in looking at precedents.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me finish this.\xc2\xa0 This is important.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the reality that is right now --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I will leave it to you, as I did to Major, to draw questions of precedent in this case.\xc2\xa0 What I am suggesting is that when this bill was signed into law it did not include offsets.\xc2\xa0 When it was renewed -- or extended, the last couple of times, which I think happened in 2010 and 2012, both times it was -- that extension was approved with bipartisan support and neither time did that extension include specific offsets.</p>\n<p>So if Republicans want to have a conversation about doing something differently than what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done before and offsetting the cost of what everybody acknowledges is an emergency program -- it certainly is an emergency for the 1.3 million Americans who stand to lose their unemployment benefits at the end of the year -- then we\xe2\x80\x99ll have that conversation.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s also important for you and your viewers to understand that when this bill was signed into law and when it was extended with bipartisan support through the Congress, offsets were not part of the equation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s the demand now.\xc2\xa0 And you said --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what I said.\xc2\xa0 I actually -- I said a lot, so I\'ll give you a pass on that.\xc2\xa0 What I also said is that if that\'s what Republicans are going to insist on this time, we are willing to have a conversation with them about that.\xc2\xa0 But that is not what they have insisted on in the past.\xc2\xa0 And I just think that\'s important for people to understand.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Is it still the administration\'s position that the Afghan security agreement has to be signed by the end of the year?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we have said about this, Scott, is that in order for the United States and our allies to plan for the post-2014 military presence, if there is one, we need to start that planning process soon.\xc2\xa0 There is an agreement on the table that was hammered out through a series of painstaking negotiations over the course of this year between Afghan leaders and allied leaders.</p>\n<p>We believe that that text reflects the best interests of both the Afghan people as well as the American people.\xc2\xa0 It also reflects the best interests of our allies, who are also involved in trying to provide -- to assist the Afghan people, provide security for their country.\xc2\xa0 So we have the text of an agreement that reflects the best interests of both sides.\xc2\xa0 We also have an agreement that the loya jirga has endorsed, and that that leadership council in Afghanistan has also urged President Karzai to sign this document sooner rather than later -- not because that would be a favor to us, but precisely because it\'s in the best interest of the Afghan people for that to happen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it is our view that that is a document that should be signed as soon as possible, and that at the very least it should be signed by the end of this year in order for us to start going through the important planning process.\xc2\xa0 Now, if you\'re asking me, does that mean that if they sign it on January 10th, that\'s going to be a huge problem -- probably not.\xc2\xa0 What will be a significant problem is if there is not quick action taken to get this signed.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of follow-ups on the jobless benefits again.\xc2\xa0 If there isn\'t any action this year, would the President propose something next year, early next year and make it retroactive?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think I would say it simply this way: There is no reason they shouldn\'t be able to get it done this year.\xc2\xa0 This is something that they got done with strong bipartisan support in the past.\xc2\xa0 A couple of times they\'ve extended this program.\xc2\xa0 It was originally signed into law by President Bush.\xc2\xa0 I know there is strong Democratic support for extending emergency unemployment benefits.\xc2\xa0 And presumably, there should be, as there has been in the past, strong Republican support for it too -- again, not just because it would meet the needs of 1.3 million Americans who stand to lose their unemployment benefits at the end of the year, but also because of the tangible impact it would have on our economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the President would continue to advocate for it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is he going to do that?\xc2\xa0 You got three days.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m advocating for it in his name right now.\xc2\xa0 You saw the President deliver --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between just speaking about it as opposed to picking up the phone and calling people --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 There have been senior White House officials here as recently as today who have been in touch with members of Congress about this exact issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President and his team are engaged because this is a priority.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is an opportunity for us to do something not just to meet the needs of people who are standing to lose their unemployment benefits around the holidays, but also an opportunity for us to do something important for the economy, that extending unemployment benefits could create 240,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 That seems like a win-win and something that Congress should act on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, just to clarify, the legislation that the President supports is the Levin bill in the House, that\'s a one-year extension, and the CBO estimates about $26 billion, is that correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 To be honest with you, I don\'t know about specific pieces of legislation, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you on that.\xc2\xa0 Suffice it to say we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the benefits to not run out on December 28th.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>April, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two questions, really fast.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, the last two.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you talk about poll numbers, what polls is the White House paying attention to more so?\xc2\xa0 Internal polls, Democratic polls?\xc2\xa0 I mean, since you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the varied results from various polls.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we read the newspaper at the White House, and we occasionally watch a little television, so we certainly are aware of the reporting on polls that are conducted.\xc2\xa0 But I got to tell you, in terms of the priorities of the White House, following the progress of polls is not very high.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s much higher is tracking the progress of legislation that would expand early childhood education to every single child in America -- legislation that would increase the minimum wage.</p>\n<p>It was notable in one of the polls -- Kristen, I believe it was your poll -- that indicated that about 50 percent of Republicans, including 50 percent of individuals who identify themselves as members of the tea party, support increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.\xc2\xa0 That is a notable finding from the polls.\xc2\xa0 So, see, we do read the newspaper about polls.</p>\n<p>And in some cases, and particularly in this case, it identifies some clear areas for cooperation and common ground -- that we could do something really important for our economy, that we could do something to address the problem of decreasing economic mobility in this country by increasing the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that close to a majority of Republicans and tea partiers support.\xc2\xa0 So maybe that\'s something that we can work on.</p>\n<p>Those are the kinds of things that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on, and those are the kinds of policy priorities that we\xe2\x80\x99re tracking.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, they attract a whole lot more attention here at the White House than individual poll numbers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last question, since you\'re talking about the successes right now of the website -- there were clear problems at the beginning.\xc2\xa0 And understanding that the website did not meet a level of expectation here, did the IT contractors meet the contracted requirements early on for the website?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that there were some failures in that process.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand up here and give you an appraisal of what exactly went wrong with the design and implementation of healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, we have the Inspector General at HHS who is working on that topic.\xc2\xa0 The President stood at this podium about a month ago and indicated that he had some unanswered questions about this process that he was determined to get an answer to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the question I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is, did the IT contractors deliver what they were asked to do?\xc2\xa0 Even though there were problems, did they deliver on their contract?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is a legitimate question.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a question I do not know the answer to.\xc2\xa0 I suspect that it is part of the inquiry that will be conducted by the Inspector General at HHS.\xc2\xa0 I would encourage you to ask him to confirm whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.\xc2\xa0 But I would anticipate that it\xe2\x80\x99s among the kinds of questions that people will be asking as they consider what went wrong.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now is what we can do to make this right:\xc2\xa0 to make sure that we can expand access and give people opportunity to sign up before this December 23rd deadline; to make sure that our website is functioning smoothly; to make sure that information that is submitted to the website is accurately conveyed to the insurance company so that people\xe2\x80\x99s insurance coverage does kick in by January 1st.\xc2\xa0 And we want to make sure that we have an ongoing effort to educate the American public about what kind of opportunities are available to them through healthcare.gov -- that there are a lot of people out there that don\xe2\x80\x99t have insurance right now, that if they go and visit the website they will find out that they can purchase quality, affordable health insurance, in many cases they qualify for tax credits.\xc2\xa0 And getting that word out is also an important priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now.\xc2\xa0 But you raise a legitimate question, but it\xe2\x80\x99s one that I can\xe2\x80\x99t answer right now.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have anything on his schedule the rest of the week?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nothing that I have to talk about right now, but as we get some more details, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Press conference before the end of the year?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 Stay tuned.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:17 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
