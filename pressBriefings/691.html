CDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 One scheduling update and one policy update before I get to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do the policy first.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Today, the Department of Treasury announced a two-year extension of the HAMP program, which has already reduced mortgage costs for more than 1.1 million responsible homeowners.\xc2\xa0 The median savings enjoyed by those homeowners through that program is $546 a month on their mortgage payment.\xc2\xa0 The program has also served as a template for private sector progress that has helped millions of other responsible homeowners save on their mortgage costs.</p>\n<p>The extension of this program, however, is not a substitute for congressional action on a universal refinancing proposal that would allow millions of responsible homeowners to refinance at the current rates, which are near all-time lows.\xc2\xa0 This would give an additional shot in the arm to our steadily recovering housing market, and put more money in the pockets of middle-class families, and it would improve the economy.\xc2\xa0 This is something that the President has been pushing for some time, and hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll get some Republicans to work with the President to get this done sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p>Now with the scheduling announcement.\xc2\xa0 Upon the President\xe2\x80\x99s return to the White House, he\xe2\x80\x99ll receive his annual hurricane briefing in the Situation Room ahead of the 2013 hurricane season, which begins on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 The briefing will include an update on the 2013 hurricane outlook from NOAA, as well as an update on the ongoing current preparedness activities in coordination with state and local partners ahead of the 2013 season.</p>\n<p>The briefing will also include a specific discussion of energy and fuel challenges following a major hurricane, informed by specific challenges and solutions employed in the response to Hurricane Sandy.\xc2\xa0 The President will be joined by members of his emergency response team, including members of his Cabinet, as well as representatives from the private sector.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a more detailed readout of the meeting after it concludes.</p>\n<p>So with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a couple of questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, today the new Quinnipiac polls have come out that have shown the President\xe2\x80\x99s approval rating at a low -- 45 percent.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that these three sort of looming controversies -- IRS, Benghazi and DOJ -- are now starting to affect the President\xe2\x80\x99s standing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the poll that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 The truth is we\xe2\x80\x99re not looking at the day-to-day polls.\xc2\xa0 What the President is focused on is the agenda that he\xe2\x80\x99s laid out -- putting the expansion of economic opportunity for middle-class families first.\xc2\xa0 That is the President\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelming priority.\xc2\xa0 That is the reason that the President ran for reelection, and I would submit to you that that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason the President was reelected.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You just heard me talk about the HAMP program extension -- that is a key part of offering some assistance to middle-class families, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep working at it.\xc2\xa0 And whether it\xe2\x80\x99s -- you heard the President talk a little bit last night about expanding early childhood education opportunities, high-quality early childhood education opportunities for children all across America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are the key parts of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on, and there will be plenty of people who can dissect the polls and try to analyze them in one way or another, but what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now is the President\xe2\x80\x99s domestic policy agenda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, was the President informed of the latest ricin letter?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports about this.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Secret Service has talked about this a little bit.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific details for you other than to point out to you that the White House does have an offsite facility that processes the mail that we receive, so we have precautions that are in place for these kinds of things.\xc2\xa0 I do believe the President is aware, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know any details about who briefed him or any other details.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as I understand it, they are only testing now for ricin; they haven\xe2\x80\x99t confirmed it yet.\xc2\xa0 Is that right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 Check with the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 They obviously have the lead on these kinds of stories.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you confirm that the President has settled on Comey for his FBI Director?\xc2\xa0 And can you discuss any timeline for making that nomination official?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There obviously has been a lot of reporting on this over the last 12 to 18 hours.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any personnel announcements to make at this time, and I\xe2\x80\x99m really not in a position to even give you a better sense of the timing.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to save that for a later day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it look like it will be at least a few days yet, or several days?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I really just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on the timing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, what does the White House think of various media organizations\xe2\x80\x99 decision not to take the off-the-record meeting with Attorney General Holder?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has already articulated his concerns about this policy.\xc2\xa0 There obviously is a complex policy challenge here between balancing the interests of the American people and protecting government secrets that are directly relevant to national security, but we also need to place a priority on protecting the First Amendment rights of journalists who have a critical role to play in terms of holding our government accountable.\xc2\xa0 The success of our democracy, frankly, relies on a free, independent, professional media.\xc2\xa0 And we need to ensure that the rights of those journalists are protected.</p>\n<p>Now, at the same time -- well, I guess I should say this -- to that end, the President has said that a journalist shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be subject to criminal prosecution just for doing their job.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the source of the President\'s concern.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- so the President has asked the Attorney General to conduct a review because of these serious concerns.\xc2\xa0 The Attorney General has begun the process of reaching out to media organizations and others who will have some input on this review.</p>\n<p>By all accounts, the Attorney General is taking this seriously, and has invited members of prominent media organizations -- leaders of prominent media organizations to participate in that review.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not uncommon for the Department of Justice, and, frankly, other administration agencies, to consult with stakeholders as we\'re making -- as we\'re conducting policy reviews and making policy decisions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the invitation to those media executives was extended by the Department of Justice, and it\'s our hope that those -- that that invitation will be accepted.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why -- was the White House involved in the decision to insist that that meeting be off the record?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the details and the ground rules for the meeting, I\'d refer you to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 They\'re the ones who are conducting the review.\xc2\xa0 But we are hopeful that media organizations will take advantage of the opportunity to constructively contribute to this process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'ve heard a lot from media organizations and media executives and journalists about how important these constitutional rights are and how important it is for the U.S. government to get the balance of these two interests -- these national security interests and these First Amendment interests -- right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So because of that persuasive --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me finish -- but because of that persuasive advocacy, the Attorney General has invited media organizations to participate, and we\'re hopeful that they will accept that invitation to participate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can understand that a meeting about concerns journalists have about the First Amendment being off the record is sort of on its face hypocritical, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually see that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I think is the -- the Attorney General is interested in having a constructive -- a policy discussion with professional journalists about this, what I think most people would acknowledge is a complex policy issue.\xc2\xa0 I think most people would understand that there are two competing interests that need to be balanced here, in terms of protecting national security secrets but also protecting the First Amendment rights of journalists.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s no reason that the Attorney General shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to engage in a constructive discussion with journalists about this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the New York Times, Associated Press and other big organizations that have said they will not attend if it\'s off the record don\xe2\x80\x99t attend, is it a constructive dialogue?\xc2\xa0 Or do you need the biggest media organizations, the most influential, at the meeting?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you should have included the Washington Post as an influential news organization.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we might be there.\xc2\xa0 We are, but I think -- we have a different policy from what I understand.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\'ll let the Attorney General and the Department of Justice give you some guidance in terms of how they\'re going to conduct this process.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\'s any doubting the seriousness with which the Attorney General is pursuing what he has identified and what the President has identified as a genuine priority.\xc2\xa0 And we are genuinely interested in the input, the opinion, the advice, the expertise of leaders of prominent media organizations.\xc2\xa0 And we are hopeful and optimistic that we are going to find a way to get their input in this process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President at all concerned that Holder is just under so much scrutiny at this point that it might affect his ability to get his job done?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not in the least.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, following up on the drone issue from yesterday -- are you in a position today to confirm the drone strike on Wali-ur-Rehman?\xc2\xa0 And yesterday, Jay suggested that hypothetically if it had -- if he had been eliminated, it would be a good thing, but the Pakistani Taliban is now saying that because of this strike that killed their number two, they\'re going to pull out of peace talks.\xc2\xa0 So does that change the calculus about whether it was a good idea?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what Jay -- I\'m not in a position to confirm any operational details like that, so -- I\'m not in a position to do that at this point.\xc2\xa0 What Jay did mention in the briefing yesterday were some relevant facts about the actions of this individual in particular, and the harm and threat that he posed to American troops serving in the Afghan theater.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of the Pakistan Taliban\'s response to this circumstance, I\'d actually refer you to the Pakistani government.\xc2\xa0 The peace talks that they have publicly raised concerns about are actually peace talks they\'re engaged in with the Pakistani government, so for a reaction to that I\'d refer you to Pakistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House feel that it\'s still constructive to eliminate some of these top Taliban people if it leads to a breakdown in reconciliation efforts?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to get ahead of any details that I\'m not in a position to confirm, but I will say, as a general matter, something similar to what the President said last week, which is the President does feel a responsibility to ensure that our troops that are in harm\'s way in the Afghan war theater are protected.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to use a range of abilities and equipment to ensure -- to provide them as much protection as possible in the Afghan war theater.\xc2\xa0 So I\'ll just leave it there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a Chinese company is buying Smithfield Foods, the world\'s largest pork producer.\xc2\xa0 What does the President think of that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 As you know is our custom, Roger, we don\'t comment on individual transactions.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m not in a position to offer a specific reaction from the President or the White House on the announcement of that transaction.\xc2\xa0 I will say, as a general matter, one of the things the President has talked about is we are supportive of efforts by foreign entities to invest in the U.S.; that this kind of direct foreign investment in general is a pretty strong endorsement of some of the economic infrastructure we have in this country in terms of facilities, technology, American workers.\xc2\xa0 And through additional foreign direct investment we can expand economic opportunity in this country.</p>\n<p>So as a general matter, we\'re in favor of efforts by foreign entities, foreign companies to invest in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of this specific transaction, I\'m not able to comment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he bring this up during the talks next week with the Chinese President at all?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a sense of that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason that he would?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if he\'ll bring it up, to be honest with you.\xc2\xa0 If we get into a -- as we get closer to the meeting, we may be able to give you a better preview of what are the items on the agenda at that point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, there are reports today of Assad saying that he has received Russian rockets.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the White House response to that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen those reports as well.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not in a position to comment on -- I\'m not in a position to confirm reports of a transfer of weapons.\xc2\xa0 We have long made clear that we are concerned about the Russian support for the Assad regime, both in the form of providing them weapons but also through access to Russian banks.\xc2\xa0 That concern is well known.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry, principally, but others are engaged in an effort to work constructively with the Russians to try to bring about a transition, a political transition in Syria.</p>\n<p>So we certainly are counting on the Russians to exercise their influence over the Assad regime to ensure that negotiators who represent the Assad regime in negotiations with the opposition are empowered to facilitate the full transfer of executive authority to a transitional government.\xc2\xa0 So there is a very important role for Russia to play here, and we\'re working with them in the hopes that they will play that role and can help facilitate this transfer that\'s so desperately needed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are seeing a terrible humanitarian situation on the ground in Syria.\xc2\xa0 The violence is continuing unabated.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that is horrific.\xc2\xa0 And it is having a destabilizing impact on the broader region.</p>\n<p>So there\'s a lot at stake here.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with the Russians to get them to step up to the plate and constructively act to resolve this situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, in addition to Assad\'s regime claiming it\'s received the missiles, the leading opposition group is saying now that they\'re not going to participate in these talks as long as the regime is still attacking them.\xc2\xa0 If you combine those two things, I mean, does it seem like the political reconciliation that the U.S. government is advocating is -- hopes for that are starting to dim?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- that\'s not necessarily our assessment.\xc2\xa0 This is an intractable problem that we\'re dealing with and there are clearly a lot of challenges that have to be defused to try to bring both sides to the table, but that is the only way we\'re going to get the kind of solution that would allow a government in Syria to take root that actually reflects the will of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 That is the ultimate goal.</p>\n<p>And so we are working with our allies and partners in the region to try to bring this -- the opposition coalition together, to sit at a table across from representatives of the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned, we\'re counting on the Russians to exercise their influence and make sure that the negotiators on behalf of the Assad regime are empowered to negotiate with a full transfer of executive authority to a transitional government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is an ongoing process and it\'s something that we are fully committed to, because this is the path to addressing this problem.\xc2\xa0 And it is a difficult and challenging one, but it\'s one that has -- there are high stakes in the outcome, and that\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99re working on this so aggressively.\xc2\xa0 And that work is continuing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you\'ve said that the President will be meeting with Senator McCain to discuss his recent trip Syria.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any updates on when that may happen?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the IRS -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a Quinnipiac poll out today saying that 76 percent of Americans would like to see a special prosecutor appointed to look into that, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President or the White House is looking at that option at all.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'re not.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that simply is that there is a new IRS commissioner in place, Danny Werfel, who is a career civil servant, who represented -- who served in administrations led by Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s conducting a 30-day review -- that was a review that was ordered by the Secretary of the Treasury at the direction of the President.\xc2\xa0 That is an ongoing review that is taking place.</p>\n<p>Our administration has already signaled our willingness to cooperate with congressional oversight in this matter.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are a couple of administration officials that have already testified on this, and there are -- our cooperation in this endeavor is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And I also understand, separately from all that, that the Department of Justice has announced a criminal investigation into this matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are a lot of people looking at this from a lot of different perspectives.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that those who need to be held accountable for the wrongdoing that occurred there will be held accountable.\xc2\xa0 And the President is committed to making sure that those steps are taken to make sure this doesn\'t happen again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\'s not any interest in an outside, independent -- completely independent person to look at it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would actually make the case to you that there are -- we do have somebody who is coming from the outside, who is a career civil servant who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, coming into the IRS to take a look at this.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got outside members of Congress -- Democrats and Republicans -- who are taking a look at this.\xc2\xa0 And we have, based on news reports, professional investigators, the Department of Justice, who are investigating this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I would actually make the case to you that we have a wide variety of outside, impartial, independent observers -- all of whom share the goal of getting to the bottom of what happened and making sure it didn\'t happen -- it doesn\'t happen again.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll cooperate with those efforts as necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just for the record, did the President meet with anybody while he was at his private residence?\xc2\xa0 Any friends come over?\xc2\xa0 Did he spend the entire time he was there alone?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update for you in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities this morning at home.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the Republican Party has said it\'s going to FOIA any emails between the State Department and the President\xe2\x80\x99s reelection campaign relating to Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 Are you confident that no emails of that nature will be turned up?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I actually haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that FOIA.\xc2\xa0 Based on what you\xe2\x80\x99ve described though, I would say that it is yet another piece of evidence that you could stack on a rather mounting pile of data to indicate that this is a politically motivated enterprise.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the specifics, I don\'t have any knowledge.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more, a little out of the box, since you went with it.\xc2\xa0 A group of 10 Republicans are asking for the Redskins to change their name as to be less offensive to Native Americans.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any feeling on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good question, and it is outside the box.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you credit for that.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to speak with him about it, so I don\'t know if he has an opinion.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go Ravens.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He supports the Blackhawks.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Anybody else?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about GMO wheat?\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, it was announced that GMO wheat that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been approved was found -- genetically modified wheat was found growing in Oregon.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the White House about this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a couple of things that I can tell you about this.\xc2\xa0 The first is I know that the FDA has indicated that there is actually no food safety threat that\'s posed by this.\xc2\xa0 There is, however, an ongoing investigation that\'s been launched by the Department of Agriculture to figure out what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with this situation, so I don\'t want to get ahead of that investigation.\xc2\xa0 We certainly have been in touch with our trading partners on this issue, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication at all at this point based on the FDA\xe2\x80\x99s review that there\xe2\x80\x99s any threat to food safety.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how concerned are you that buyers are going to stop buying U.S. wheat because of this, because of uncertainty about this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I actually don\'t have much insight into that. I\xe2\x80\x99d check with the Department of Agriculture to see if they would be able to offer you an assessment on that.</p>\n<p>We good?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:33 P.M. CDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
