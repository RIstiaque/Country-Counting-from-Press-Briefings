EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Happy St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day, everyone.\xc2\xa0 A lot of green out there -- appreciate that, as a Carney.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would just start by saying I assume you all got the advisory that the President will have a statement this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I have, again, brought today some of our experts who can discuss the situation in Japan and, more specifically, our -- what this administration, this government is doing to help the Japanese in dealing with that situation and what the implications are for American citizens.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I will turn this over to them very briefly -- actually in a minute.\xc2\xa0 I just want to again say that if they could make their quick opening statements, then take questions from you on the subject area that concerns them so that they can then depart, I will stay and take questions on other issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have, just to remind you, with me on my far right the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Mr. Greg Jaczko, and on my near right, Dan Poneman, the Deputy Secretary of Energy.\xc2\xa0 I will turn it over to them.\xc2\xa0 Greg, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you start with a statement, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give you a brief status update on basically three points.\xc2\xa0 One, we have a team of 11 technical experts who continue to work in Tokyo to provide assistance to the Japanese government and to the ambassador in Tokyo.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday the NRC looked at the available information that we had.\xc2\xa0 Based on that information, we took a look at how we would deal with a situation similar to that in the United States, and based on that, we recommended that citizens out to about 50 miles should be evacuated.\xc2\xa0 We provided that recommendation to the ambassador, and he issued a statement for American citizens to that effect.\xc2\xa0 And I want to stress that this is we think a prudent and a precautionary measure to take.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, I just want to reiterate that we don\xe2\x80\x99t see any concern from radiation levels that could be harmful here in the United States or any of the U.S. territories.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Dan, then.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, and good morning.\xc2\xa0 We have continued working very hard in consultation with our great friends and strong allies in Japan as they\xe2\x80\x99ve come to terms and wrestled with this very challenging situation.\xc2\xa0 I think most of you know that our equipment that we sent over to support them in their efforts has arrived on a C-17.\xc2\xa0 We sent a team of 33 additional people, which were added to the six people we already had out there in Japan.\xc2\xa0 They had over 17,000 pounds of equipment with them.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve unpacked that.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve actually taken the two pods that do the aerial measurement of ground depositions, mounted them -- one on a fixed-wing aircraft, one on a helicopter -- and we flew those aircraft on their first missions.\xc2\xa0 We have been collecting information as they\xe2\x80\x99ve come back.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of sharing that information with our Japanese hosts.\xc2\xa0 And while that\xe2\x80\x99s still being looked at, the preliminary indications are that they are consistent with the recommendations that came down from the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which then Ambassador Roos used to make a 50-mile evacuation guideline.\xc2\xa0 So the indications are that that looks like it was a prudent move.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Other countries around the world all continue to do what they can to support the Japanese as they lead this effort to address this challenge.\xc2\xa0 We have had a number of consultations.\xc2\xa0 I have personally been in contact with my counterparts in France and Russia, all of us thinking about ways in which we can assist the Japanese as they come to terms with this challenge.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to be our focus in the days and weeks ahead.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work very closely with the Japanese and come to do what we can to see a safe path through this in support of Japanese-led efforts to come to terms with this very dangerous situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we begin with questions.\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 First, for Chairman Jaczko, when you talk about the 50-mile recommendation of yesterday being based on the best available information, could you tell us where exactly the United States is getting its information and whether it is -- you would consider it to be hard facts or best guesses?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have -- as I said, we have a team of 11 of some of our best technical experts in Tokyo, and they\xe2\x80\x99re working with counterparts from the utility in Tokyo as well as other individuals with the government.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the sources.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re collecting data from as many places as we can to -- as I said, to make the best judgments we can with the information available.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I would stress that this is a very difficult situation.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s often conflicting information.\xc2\xa0 And so we made what we thought was a prudent decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how would you characterize your faith in the accuracy of information you\xe2\x80\x99re getting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the team we have in place is providing us with good and reliable information.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to do what we can to support the people of Japan and to provide assistance and recommendations where we can.\xc2\xa0 This is a very difficult situation, and there will be a lot of work continuing as we go forward to deal with continuing to cool the reactors and to provide cooling to the spent fuel pool.\xc2\xa0 So as we go forward we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue that dialogue and discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question.\xc2\xa0 What is your assessment as we stand, as you stand here today, about where this is headed?\xc2\xa0 Best-case scenario, worst-case scenario?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate on where this could go.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous efforts ongoing right now to continue to provide cooling to the reactors and continue to provide cooling to the spent fuel pool.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re working to provide assistance where we can with ideas about how to address that, and if necessary provide equipment and other means.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, just to follow up Ben\xe2\x80\x99s initial question about what kind of -- what level of faith the U.S. government has in how the Japanese are handling the crisis.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration satisfied with or not how Japan is handling it?\xc2\xa0 And how would you categorize the -- and are they satisfied with the level of information being provided by Japanese authorities?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m the head of an independent regulatory agency, so I would defer the questions about the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position to the others.\xc2\xa0 But I would just say, again, our efforts are really working to help the Japanese people deal with what is a very difficult and really tragic situation.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to focus and see what we can do to provide them with any assistance we can.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 If I could just comment on that.\xc2\xa0 You know Americans, we always want more information and we are constantly trying to find out whatever we can.\xc2\xa0 And as the chairman said, the facts on the ground are genuinely complex, they are genuinely confusing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have had a dialogue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had our two experts that are already out in Japan; they\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaging directly with the Japanese.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had as recently as yesterday, senior-level officials from METI and from the Nuclear Industrial Security Agency in Japan in direct consultation with us.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to maintain that dialogue and do whatever we can in support of their efforts to get this situation under control.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Chairman, you said that there\xe2\x80\x99s no concern, I guess here, domestically that radiation will be harmful.\xc2\xa0 In addition to the ongoing measurements I guess that are taken on a regular basis apart -- aside from this disaster, what else is being done to get an accurate measurement that none of this will impact the United States?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d probably turn to Dan to answer that question.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re really focused, again, first and foremost, on making sure the plants in this country are safe and then continuing to provide assistance to the Japanese with their efforts in dealing with the crisis there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition just to the regular measurements that are taken, have you beefed up that effort to check the quality of the air in the United States?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a continuous effort, as you well know, that the EPA runs to make sure we have detectors all over the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in addition to that, has there been anything that\xe2\x80\x99s been added?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 I will refer you to EPA for more specifics on anything they\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 What we have been doing to support them in that effort is to make sure that we have the people at Lawrence Livermore who are working on the modeling aspect of this so that as and when data comes in, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the capability and a robust one to analyze that information.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s, of course, something that we do in conjunction with NOAA and Jane Lubchenko.\xc2\xa0 So everything that could be done to be prepared for such time as that mechanism needs to be used has been done.\xc2\xa0 But I would go back to what the chairman has said.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that indicates at this stage that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be required under the circumstances as we now understand them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Americans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be concerned at this point?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 I just want to stress, I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any real disagreement here.\xc2\xa0 The basic physics and basic science tells us that there really can\xe2\x80\x99t be any risk or harm to anyone here in the United States or Hawaii or any of the other territories.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we feel very comfortable with.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s really just based on the basic facts and science that\xe2\x80\x99s involved here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Chairman, could you tell us, since the three days since you stood there before, why did the situation deteriorate the way it did, the four reactors?\xc2\xa0 Can you explain to us what has happened?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the pictures of the reactors.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s happened since you were here on Monday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, the situation continues to be very dynamic in Japan.\xc2\xa0 And as we looked at a lot of the available information, we saw greater challenges, I think, with providing cooling to some of the spent fuel pools that had initially not been as much of an issue.\xc2\xa0 So that was really one of the major changes that led us to reevaluate some of our information and come up with the recommendation we did.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the situation as it stands right now?\xc2\xa0 The attempts today to put water in there don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have done much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say right now there\xe2\x80\x99s continued efforts to do that.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to provide water into the spent fuel pools as well as continue to provide cooling to the reactor core.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s really what their focus is going to have to be for some time, is just to continue that activity of cooling and getting water or other means to cool the reactors and the pools.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Days or weeks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 This is something that will likely take some time to work through, possibly weeks, as eventually you remove the majority of the heat from the reactors and then the spent fuel pool.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s something that will be ongoing for some time.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why, as I said, we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to do everything we can to provide assistance to the Japanese as they deal with this situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that the 11 experts, the 11 American experts, are in Tokyo.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that they are completely reliant on Japanese officials and utility officials closer to the site to give them the information that they then analyze?\xc2\xa0 Or is there an independent way for them to get information about what\xe2\x80\x99s actually happening?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re working with counterparts from the utility and other officials there to gather information.\xc2\xa0 And then, of course, they\xe2\x80\x99re using their judgment, they\xe2\x80\x99re communicating back here with our staff and headquarters; we\xe2\x80\x99re reaching out to experts in this country to provide additional ideas if necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are they getting any independent information on their own, or is it all coming to them from somebody in Japan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, the information is coming to them from sources ultimately in Japan.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is a very dynamic and a very -- I think a complicated situation in Japan.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work with their counterparts there and continue to provide recommendations to us about what we think we can do to help the Japanese.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I ask that because even the Prime Minister of Japan and certainly the Japanese public have expressed great frustration with the secrecy and lack of transparency coming in particular from the utility.\xc2\xa0 Are you experiencing that same frustration, are your people, that same frustration in getting information?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, they are -- I think the people we have in Tokyo, they are talking with experts there, they\xe2\x80\x99re talking with individuals from the utility.\xc2\xa0 And I think they\xe2\x80\x99re getting information that is useful to us in making the kinds of recommendations that we need to make.\xc2\xa0 And our focus is really on looking at how would this\xc2\xa0 situation be similar to a situation in the United States, and then providing suggestions for actions we may need to take relative to American citizens.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Japanese are, as I said, they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with a very significant crisis and they have a lot of efforts focused on trying to deal with the reactors, trying to deal with the situation on the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we have a small team there, they\xe2\x80\x99re getting good information and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do what we can to help.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the 50 miles, are you -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 I might just add there, that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important that we get the information that we have now sent the equipment over to collect.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve had two flights come back with additional data pull there.\xc2\xa0 We sent other detectors over there, other sampling equipment.\xc2\xa0 And so it\xe2\x80\x99s not just people talking to people; we\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to collect the information that will give us the measurements that will help inform policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is that because you\xe2\x80\x99re frustrated you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to get that information directly from the Japanese?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 No, to the contrary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no frustration -- even though the Prime Minister himself just blew up at a press conference over the lack of transparency from TEPCO.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 And as I said, we Americans always want more information.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re striving for that, but we want a combination of data and things that you can get through collection and things that we get from talking to people who are dealing with this.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do what we can to support the Japanese in their efforts, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a continuing dialogue and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the 50-mile issue, do you agree that it\xe2\x80\x99s a strange situation that you can have different citizens from different countries getting different advice on this, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it need to all be one consistent standard?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have different regulatory systems throughout the world and we have different approaches to dealing with these kinds of issues.\xc2\xa0 So we took the available information we had and we looked at how we would deal with a similar situation here in the United States and we made the recommendation about 50 miles.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are American citizens who don\xe2\x80\x99t obey that information risking their lives?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 The recommendation is ultimately a precautionary measure right now based on -- what we looked at are some of the risks and challenges going forward in this situation.\xc2\xa0 So we provided the recommendation to the ambassador, the ambassador made that recommendation, and we think it\xe2\x80\x99s a prudent measure to take.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but you\xe2\x80\x99re the scientist.\xc2\xa0 Are people putting their safety in danger?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 As I said, we think it\xe2\x80\x99s a prudent measure to follow the evacuation based on how we would handle a situation like that in the United

CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered that one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Yes, Mike.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Chairman, my understanding is Senators Boxer and Carper have sent a letter to you asking the NRC to review that ability of American facilities to withstand a -- just different types of disasters.\xc2\xa0 The other day it sounded like maybe that review wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary because we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly reviewing our facilities.\xc2\xa0 But have you seen the letter?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction?\xc2\xa0 What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, any time there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant event like this anywhere in the world, or even something like this in the United States, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take a look at what happened, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do a systematic and a methodical review of the information, and if we need to make changes to our program we\xe2\x80\x99ll make changes to our program.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I want to emphasize and stress that we have a very robust program where we look at the safety and the security of our nuclear facilities on a minute-by-minute basis.\xc2\xa0 And this certainly will be new information that when we have good, credible information about what happened in Japan, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take that information and we\xe2\x80\x99ll work to see what changes we might need to make, if any, to our system.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 I might just add to that, from the aspect of policy, safety has always been our paramount concern and we will continue to strive to make sure that all of our energy sources keep that first and foremost.\xc2\xa0 And so we continue to rely on the independence of the NRC and its ability to make those judgment calls as to whether it is operating safely enough.\xc2\xa0 But we will not rest from our perspective at all, because we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to take every data we can into account and continue to improve the safety of our nuclear power and any other energy source that we are advancing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I imagine the one-two punch of a massive earthquake and then a tsunami has to make people in this country concerned about whether our facilities can withstand that, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 I would think that we -- we do not need to have that great stimuli to have a continued focus on safety.\xc2\xa0 It goes back decades, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed.\xc2\xa0 After Three Mile Island, which was a different kind of set of facts than what we are now presented with, we went to school on that situation.\xc2\xa0 We improved the way we do our regulations.\xc2\xa0 We moved toward a more passive design approach when it comes to cooling cores and so forth.\xc2\xa0 And we exercise and we\xe2\x80\x99ve come up with hypotheticals, and then we take facts in hand as they present themselves.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a continuous effort and it\xe2\x80\x99s built into the management principles of our organization that we\xe2\x80\x99re always going to look to do what we can to make sure our activities are all carried out in the safest manner possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chuck.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, in your opening statement, you said that the aerial footage confirmed the chairman\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations.\xc2\xa0 And what the chairman had testified to you yesterday was that he thought that there was no more water in the pool, essentially, there was no more cooling mechanism.\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re finding in this footage?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 Those are two different things.\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, what we sent out were these pods, and these pods measure deposition of radioactive materials on the ground.\xc2\xa0 And so what our -- what I said was that our preliminary indications -- because the data is being analyzed, it\xe2\x80\x99s being shared with the Japanese so they can analyze it, too -- suggest that the prudential measure that the chairman recommended in terms of the 50-mile radius for evacuation is consistent with what we\xe2\x80\x99re finding.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not related to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t have evidence yet of whether this pool -- because he had testified yesterday that you would fear that there was no more water in this fourth -- in the spent fuel pond.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 If I could just say -- I think I can answer the question.\xc2\xa0 The Japanese themselves have indicated that the level of water in that pond is low and is of concern.\xc2\xa0 And there have been -- we certainly saw the chairman\xe2\x80\x99s testimony yesterday, and we\xe2\x80\x99re getting whatever data we can on the situation at that pool.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change what we -- what is important, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the Japanese, as they have themselves indicated, need to get more cooling water into that pool.\xc2\xa0 So anything that can be done in that direction, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s from water cannons or water drops, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be something they\xe2\x80\x99re focused on, and of course, we would do whatever we could to help them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just two quick questions, and either one of you -- does the Japanese government still have the capacity to manage this crisis on their own at this point, or has this completely overwhelmed them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just make the following point:\xc2\xa0 The Japanese government has tremendous longstanding capabilities in this area.\xc2\xa0 They have responsibly been developing an integrated nuclear industry for decades.\xc2\xa0 It has always been in close cooperation not only with other partnering countries, which certainly includes the United States, but with the International Atomic Energy Agency and international fora.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they have treated safety as a very important responsibility, and certainly the indications you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the Prime Minister, chief cabinet secretary, speaking to people, show their continued commitment to that.\xc2\xa0 And we, as their close friends and allies and as a country that is also committed to the safe development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes to build a low-carbon energy future, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to support them in that effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For Mr. Jaczko, the statement that the NRC put out yesterday saying that the protective action recommendations are implemented when projected doses could exceed one rem to the body or five rems to the thyroid.\xc2\xa0 How likely is it in this current situation that those doses would exceed one rem to the body and five rems to the thyroid?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the recommendation was based on the possibility of certain scenarios happening that just haven\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet.\xc2\xa0 So we thought given the situation we were seeing, that there was a possibility of the situation becoming worse.\xc2\xa0 And as a result, we thought it was a prudent measure to take the recommendations that we provided.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t have dosing estimates, per se, within that radius?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve done some very preliminary modeling just to give us an estimate of where we think the likelihood of radiation levels around the plant would be high enough to trigger these kind of protective action recommendations.\xc2\xa0 But right now, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s based on a series of prudent assumptions and prudent assessments of what could happen, which is the way that we go about generally doing our protective action recommendations here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 So that was really the way we approached it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And picking up on Chuck\xe2\x80\x99s question, a Japanese official today said he did not know if that cooling pool has been emptied.\xc2\xa0 Is it still your assessment that that cooling pond with the spent fuel rods is now empty?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, everything -- when we made the determination the other day, everything indicated that that was the case.\xc2\xa0 And I think as has been said, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of conflicting information around this.\xc2\xa0 But the bottom line is, is that there clearly appears to be a challenge keeping that spent fuel filled with sufficient water.\xc2\xa0 So it is a very dynamic situation.\xc2\xa0 And again, our efforts are really focused here on helping the Japanese deal with what is a very tragic and difficult situation, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to provide recommendations and expertise where we can to help.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the NRC release the data to the public that it\xe2\x80\x99s using?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 We did release the data.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Julianna.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the questions in the letter that Mike referenced is which nuclear -- U.S. nuclear power plants share similar design features with the affected Japanese reactor facilities.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a tally of the plants that have the similar design features?\xc2\xa0 And also, is there any -- you talked about potential for review, but what about specifically reviewing those plants with those designs or older plants?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are about -- there are 35 so-called boiling water reactor designs in this country.\xc2\xa0 Twenty-three of those have the so-called Mark I containment, which is the containment which is similar to the type that\xe2\x80\x99s used in the facilities we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And over the years, we have done studies and assessments of those particular types of reactors.\xc2\xa0 And actually over several decades, actually in the late \xe2\x80\x9880s and early \xe2\x80\x9890s, changes were made to those containments to deal with these types of very severe scenarios.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So again, when we get all the relevant data and we have good, solid data about what happened in Japan, we intend to take a very thorough look at what happened and what changes that we could make.\xc2\xa0 And I understand the President yesterday recommended that this is something the NRC should look at, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that I think we will.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at this point you don\xe2\x80\x99t see the need for a specific -- a review of specifically those plants with those design features?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t really know exactly what the most relevant information is right now from Japan.\xc2\xa0 So we want to get that information and we want to do a systematic and a methodical look at what changes we may need to make to those types of plants or possibly any other types of plants in the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll just take a few more for these gentlemen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to what Julianna asked about the plants that are similar to the plants in Japan that are having problems.\xc2\xa0 With the ones that are similar, and going back to what you said about the teaching moments, the plants that are here that are similar, some of the ones that you are looking at, are they along fault lines?\xc2\xa0 And have you tested in any kind of way if there was a possibility of an earthquake how would these cooling systems be able to handle shutting the nuclear reactors down?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, all the plants in the United States are designed to deal with a wide range of natural disasters, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s earthquakes, tornados, tsunamis, other seismic events.\xc2\xa0 We require all of them to deal with those.\xc2\xa0 And what we really look at is we look at historically what are the largest kinds of events that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen happen, and we then add a little bit of something extra to that just because we know we don\xe2\x80\x99t know everything.\xc2\xa0 And from that we design the plants to be able to withstand that kind of activity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, as I said, over the years we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone a little bit beyond that as well, because we know that sometimes there\xe2\x80\x99s limitations in our knowledge.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at what we call severe accidents, which are these kinds of very catastrophic situations, and the plants over the years have made modifications that deal with these very catastrophic types of events.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, following September 11th, the agency ordered all the nuclear power plants in this country to basically pre-stage equipment and materials and have procedures in place to deal with a situation very similar to what we have in Japan, where you have a catastrophic loss of power in a very catastrophic situation at the nuclear power plant.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve inspected that -- that all the plants have those procedures and they have that equipment in place.\xc2\xa0 So we think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a very robust program in this country to deal with those things.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Last one, Margaret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many -- wait, I want to follow up.\xc2\xa0 How many of these nuclear facilities are on fault lines in the United States?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, all the nuclear power plants in this country are designed to deal with seismic events.\xc2\xa0 We tend to think about it at the NRC not in terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s near a fault line but in terms of the different types of seismic activity.\xc2\xa0 So, in fact, every plant in the United States is designed to deal with whatever seismic activity is likely for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand, but how many are on fault lines?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to be funny, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a serious question because there is concern about some of these nuclear reactors in California.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CHAIRMAN JACZKO:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly with the plants in California, they are designed to a very robust seismic standard, and for the ones that are on the coast they\xe2\x80\x99re also designed to deal with a very significant tsunami.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, after the 2004 tsunami, we took a look at the programs we have in place to deal with the tsunamis, much as I expect we\xe2\x80\x99ll do here with the situation from Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, wait, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I did say Margaret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to quickly clarify about the new aerial measurements that have come back.\xc2\xa0 Those came back, in fact, after you made the 50-mile radius recommendation, right?\xc2\xa0 Is what they showed is that the Japanese have underestimated the radiation?\xc2\xa0 Is that what the new data has shown?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 No, first of all, we\xe2\x80\x99re analyzing the information and we\xe2\x80\x99re sharing it with the Japanese.\xc2\xa0 The preliminary look at it has indicated that the measures that have been taken have been prudent ones from all of our perspective.\xc2\xa0 What we monitor from the U.S. side is the guidance that comes out from the ambassador, which is informed by the chairman\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation on a 50-mile radius.\xc2\xa0 And we have no reason to question the assessment that had been made or the recommendation that had been made by the Japanese authorities.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the measurements don\xe2\x80\x99t suggest that the Japanese best guess earlier was an under-guess?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN:\xc2\xa0 The preliminary indications suggest that all the measures that have been recommended either by the government of Japan or by the government of the U.S. have been prudent and appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you gentlemen brief the President today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can answer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I answer for them.\xc2\xa0 As you know, Chairman Jaczko briefed the President yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He has not personally briefed the President today.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re both part of a team that is being constantly tapped by the National Security Advisor, the Homeland Security Advisor, Deputy National Security Advisor.\xc2\xa0 I know, because I was with them, that Chairman Jaczko was here at the Situation Room until very late last night.\xc2\xa0 So this is a highly coordinated effort and the President is getting very regular updates on the information that they gather and provide.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s he going to announce?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the President.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You walked into that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I think we said that he would have something to say about Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ben.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll do this -- let\xe2\x80\x99s just say -- let\xe2\x80\x99s move very quickly on these other issues.\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quickly, going back to the big picture here, does the President have full faith that Japan is handling this crisis appropriately and forthrightly?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, spoke for a long time yesterday evening with the Prime Minister of Japan.\xc2\xa0 He is very concerned about the situation in Japan and wanted to make sure that the Prime Minister knew that the United States is fully committed to the alliance, to our friendship with the Japanese, and that we are committed to do everything we can to help them get through this very critical situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The coordination between the Japanese government and the international folks, including the United States, who are there providing assistance, is very robust.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I should just refer you to the statements that Chairman Jaczko and Secretary Poneman made, which is it\xe2\x80\x99s a very fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of information.\xc2\xa0 It is not particularly easy to get information from the site because of all the reasons that have been cited about the potential radiation emissions and the damage done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not a question of satisfaction beyond the fact that we are craving information, and I think the way Secretary Poneman described it, as Americans we always want more information.\xc2\xa0 But the cooperation is there, the data is being shared, and we look forward to continuing to work side by side with our Japanese partners in helping them and assisting them deal with this problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, just quickly, to follow up, I understand that the coordination is there and that these events are fluid, but I ask that because I think the American people are trying to figure this out and they\xe2\x80\x99re looking to the government, our government, to say, should we have faith in the Japanese government that things are going to be handled.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m still trying to figure out whether --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, but, Ben, here\xe2\x80\x99s the situation.\xc2\xa0 This is the Japanese government, crisis in Japan.\xc2\xa0 They are obviously in the lead.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the question implies, that we would take over the effort --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- the question is just about whether President Obama has faith that the Japanese government is able to handle this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 President Obama has great faith in the idea that the Japanese are fully aware of the severity of the crisis that they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with.\xc2\xa0 How could they not?\xc2\xa0 And they have a tremendous amount of capacity of resources to deal with this very difficult problem, but it is a crisis significant enough that a lot of countries, including the United States, led by the United States, have come in to offer further aid and assistance and expertise to help them deal with it.\xc2\xa0 But it is a crisis in Japan that the Japanese obviously have to take the lead in dealing with -- and they are.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Matt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, on Libya, what\xe2\x80\x99s the reason for the administration\xe2\x80\x99s shift from what was earlier very lukewarm support for the idea of a no-fly zone and now seems to be backing for something as extreme as air strikes on Libyan ground forces?\xc2\xa0 And is this still -- are these such measures, if approved by the U.N., enough to stave off defeat for the rebels?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is that your analysis that it\xe2\x80\x99s a shift or is it something you believe that any American official said?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that that has shifted.\xc2\xa0 I mean, your -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through days of briefings in which --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we have made --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- no-fly zone has been knocked down.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 What Secretary Rice -- or rather, Ambassador Rice and Secretary Clinton have been doing have been working -- Ambassador Rice in particular at the United Nations -- on negotiating with our partners on the Security Council on a resolution that would support a more effective international response to the situation on the ground in Libya.\xc2\xa0 The President has instructed his team to play an active and leading role in these negotiations, which are aimed at producing a result which would help protect civilians and increase the pressure on the Qaddafi regime.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, broadening out, in terms of -- we have made it clear from the first time you and others asked me about this question of a no-fly zone weeks ago, that we are actively considering it and it is an option the President insisted would be on the table.\xc2\xa0 The fact that we have also discussed that we need to look at a broad range of other options, that we want to make sure that the options we choose and pursue will be effective at protecting civilians and putting pressure on the Qaddafi regime, are not contradictory.\xc2\xa0 That remains our position.\xc2\xa0 And we are certainly looking at a resolution that will authorize the -- taking action on a variety of measures that include but go beyond a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 It is not our feeling that, as apparently it is -- has been from some others, that a no-fly zone is a snap-your-fingers, one-size-fits-all solution to a problem.\xc2\xa0 And what we want is action on a variety of items that can improve the situation in Libya.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the President is being briefed on not only what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Japan but the review that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing here in the United States of nuclear facilities, is he conveying a sense of urgency that all of these experts need to really sort of step up their game to ensure that facilities here domestically are indeed safe and that an accident that we\xe2\x80\x99re witnessing in Japan cannot occur like that here?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he is.\xc2\xa0 He is making sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense of urgency.\xc2\xa0 And he made clear in some interviews he gave the other day that he has requested and asked that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is an independent body, take into account the information we\xe2\x80\x99re getting about what happened in Japan and the ramifications of that on the nuclear facility there; that it takes that information, analyzes it, and then applies the lessons learned to its analysis of the security and safety of the reactors here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, that is the NRC\xe2\x80\x99s mission, and I would say that the fact that the President has made that request himself only adds to the urgency of that mission.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we should remind Americans that the NRC exists precisely for that reason, and that it is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a daily mission for that agency to play out scenarios, evaluate data, and make changes in the security procedures and structures at the nuclear facilities in the United States on a regular basis as it deems necessary to maintain the highest possible security and safety at those facilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick question on Libya.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a timeline that the administration is looking at?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been talk now for several weeks about options -- we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at various different options.\xc2\xa0 At what point will you really start executing some of these options?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Dan, we\xe2\x80\x99ve executed an enormous array of options, as you know, in response to -- both unilaterally and with our partners internationally -- in response to the situation in Libya, and we moved very quickly out of the box within, I think, nine days to get some of those actions in place.\xc2\xa0 Nine days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the resolution that may emerge from the United Nations, whether -- I think Ann asked me when, and I would refer to my colleagues up in New York on the timing of that.\xc2\xa0 But whether it\xe2\x80\x99s today or tomorrow, whenever it is, it will be at a time that, comparative to any similar action taken by the United Nations in its past, will be with remarkable speed, unprecedented speed.\xc2\xa0 So the urgency has been there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the timeline has simply -- has been driven by, from our perspective, making sure the actions we take are the right ones and that we do not pursue an action that sounds good, only to find out it\xe2\x80\x99s actually not achieving a purpose that we wanted it to achieve.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the actions that Ambassador Rice is negotiating in New York will hopefully address the problem and the situation on the ground in a way that can be effective.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have we gone from considering actively those options that you speak of that would be in the U.N. to actually advocating them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All I\xe2\x80\x99ll say on that is that the President has instructed his team in New York to play an active and leading role in the negotiations with the goal of protecting civilians.\xc2\xa0 And they are obviously working on a resolution which will contain hopefully within it a variety of new options that the international community can take action on that will affect the situation on the ground; protect civilians in Libya.\xc2\xa0 So I think that answers your question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier today Senator John McCain told Sky News that he had some major concerns; that the situation in Bahrain could in fact turn into a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\xc2\xa0 Does this administration share those concerns?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The concerns that we have about the situation in Bahrain have been, I think, very clearly expressed by the Secretary of State, as well as by me here at the podium, which is we find the use of violence against peaceful protestors to be extremely unfortunate, abhorrent and simply not the kind of actions that will lead to a resolution of the political problems that exist in Bahrain and that exist in countries around the region.\xc2\xa0 We urge maximum restraint on the government of Bahrain and everyone else in Bahrain as they deal with this situation.\xc2\xa0 We urge political dialogue, peaceful political dialogue aimed at bringing about the kind of reforms that will respond to the legitimate grievances that Bahrainis have expressed on the streets of their capital city.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But outside interests don\xe2\x80\x99t concern this administration?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are obviously always concerned about the behavior of Iran.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about our general suspiciousness of their motivations.\xc2\xa0 But the guiding principle we have in looking at the events in Bahrain and the principles that the President of the United States expressed to the King yesterday, as I read out from here, are that we believe that all sides need to exercise maximum restraint, refrain from violence, and come together in a national dialogue that resolves these issues in a way that will in the end benefit the people of Bahrain, the country of Bahrain, and will provide in the long run the kind of stability that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Bahrain wants and its people deserve.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow on that, Jay, on Iran?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On nuclear --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How important has the promise by Arab nations to take part in any military intervention, not simply support it, been in the administration\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s extremely important.\xc2\xa0 We feel, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times, that the actions taken by the Arab League over the weekend, the statements that they put out, were very significant in making clear to the regime in Libya, to the people around the region, and to people around the world and governments around the world, that the international community is united in its opposition to<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Qaddafi and his actions against his own people, and that the international community is united as it moves forward to take action -- more action -- aimed at protecting civilians in Libya and eventually removing Qaddafi from power.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the -- and in terms of participation, we think that is very important because of the signal it sends that this is not a Western action, not an American action, but an international action with the support of the governments and the people in the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Israel, Jay?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me move -- yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 As Qaddafi intensifies his attacks on rebel-held areas, how concerned is the President that by the time the United Nations decides to act it would be too late to save lives and too late to set back the advances of Qaddafi towards these areas?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that we are very concerned about the situation in Libya and the violence that is being perpetrated by the Qaddafi regime against its people.\xc2\xa0 We are acting with a great sense of urgency, together with our international partners, to take the kinds of actions that we believe will protect Libyan citizens and move towards a situation where Qaddafi is no longer in power -- which is what we believe the Libyan people want.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So again, I would just refer you to the fact that the actions that we -- the international community with the leadership of the United States -- have taken are unprecedented in their speed and their sweep and their scope, and the actions that the United Nations may take as it -- when it emerges from -- the Security Council emerges from its negotiations, will again be unprecedented in their speed and scope.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would one vote, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the permanent members, which of course, can veto the Security Council -- would one vote then move -- prevent the United States from taking any action?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge what will happen at the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 We are working obviously very closely in partnership with other members of the Security Council to craft a resolution that can --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think a strong vote in support even if there is one holdout --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge it.\xc2\xa0 I can just say that we have been acting in concert with our international partners in a variety of ways since the beginning of this situation in Libya and will obviously continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 But I do not want to in any way prejudge the outcome at the United Nations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Israel --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry -- Abby.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick question.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to take any questions in the Rose Garden today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s -- he will be just issuing a statement today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given -- a quick follow-up -- since he won\xe2\x80\x99t be -- I won\xe2\x80\x99t have or anyone won\xe2\x80\x99t have an opportunity to ask him, he said that he\xe2\x80\x99d asked the Pentagon last week whether the treatment of Bradley Manning was appropriate.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if he believes personally that the treatment of Bradley Manning is appropriate, and what we can read from the fact that just a day later they changed the conditions under which he was being held.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you -- I would not expand beyond what the President said in terms of his personal reaction to the question.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to the statements the State Department and the Defense Department have made on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the U.S. strategic interest in Libya?\xc2\xa0 Why is the President contemplating a policy to possibly put U.S. forces in danger for what is essentially right now a civil war?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear from here, and others have, that the United States believes obviously that the actions of the Qaddafi government against its people are reprehensible and abhorrent, and we have called on him to cease and desist.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have worked together with our international partners -- not alone, but with our international partners -- to take measures that we believe will put the kind of pressure on Qaddafi that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to get him to cease and desist and eventually leave power.\xc2\xa0 And we think it is in the interest of the United States to take the actions we have taken with our international partners to do just that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President not believe that this is a civil war?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- the terminology is not the issue here.\xc2\xa0 The actions on the ground are obvious.\xc2\xa0 The calls that we and others have made that they cease have been clear.\xc2\xa0 And the actions that we will take -- that we have taken and we will take going forward -- are \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 aimed at affecting that situation positively.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it hurt the President when he -- and you, also from the podium -- continually call for Qaddafi to leave power, to give up power, and yet he is still in power?\xc2\xa0 Does it in any way hurt the strength of the President in terms of issuing those types of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply remind you again that we are talking here about an event that is only weeks old.\xc2\xa0 So to suggest that somehow we could -- anybody could snap their fingers and when a leader in a country takes action that the international community condemns -- that leader, if he or she decides that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to hunker down and stay in power, that days pass and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t left is some measure of the impact of the international community, that\xe2\x80\x99s I think a silly standard to set.\xc2\xa0 Because what we are seeing here is remarkable cooperation at the international level, with leadership by the United States, to put immense pressure on the regime in Libya to cease the violence, to stop killing its own people, and to give up power.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me go all the way in the back.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the dangers of the reactor in Japan, what real effect has that had on any U.S.-led efforts for humanitarian rescue, relief, anything like that, to people that are still very isolated from any sort of support?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of the specifics, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of the question.\xc2\xa0 We have -- the United States government has in very quick fashion made resources available to the Japanese to help in the rescue effort, to help in the -- in humanitarian efforts that are ongoing, obviously, in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think, if I could, that the total obligations that -- this is a USAID-led effort.\xc2\xa0 The total obligation at this point is over $10 million.\xc2\xa0 Obviously those numbers will go up because of the presence of teams and equipment that keeps coming -- keep coming in.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s a multifaceted effort that the United States is making on behalf of the Japanese people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But have radiation concerns dampened any efforts to actually move assets into any of these areas?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would have to refer you to USAID, Defense Department, Department of Energy, in terms of that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have answers to those questions.\xc2\xa0 But I can say that a great deal of effort is being expended to assist the Japanese.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Follow-up, Jay, on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, let me move -- Bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, after -- in light of what happened in Japan, Germany yesterday shut down seven nuclear reactors; the head of the E.U. said they were going to do an immediate review of every reactor in 27 different countries.\xc2\xa0 Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t President Obama demanded the same thing for reactors in this country?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, I think I answered this question a couple of times already, and I think Chairman Jaczko has answered it, too.\xc2\xa0 We, the United States of America, have an independent regulatory agency whose sole mission is to constantly review and evaluate the safety and security of the reactors in the United States, which provide 20 percent of the electricity that Americans consume.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he has full confidence in the NRC and believes in it then?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has full confidence that the agency charged with this responsibility is fulfilling its responsibility, and he has tasked that agency to take into account all of the information it is gleaning from the events in Japan and evaluate that information and apply it as responsible -- as would be responsible and necessary in evaluating the security and safety of the reactors here in the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All the way in the back.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a couple of weeks ago, the President of Mexico was standing with President Obama, and the President of the U.S. says Mexico has a successful story against war on drugs.\xc2\xa0 But yesterday you had FBI director, Mr. Mueller, went to Capitol Hill and he was asked about it.\xc2\xa0 He says he cannot say it\xe2\x80\x99s a successful story because the level of murders and atrocities.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the real position of the U.S. government?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President said is he commended Mr. Calder\xc3\xb3n on his bravery and his commitment to taking on this enormous challenge.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a very difficult situation and it takes a great deal of bravery and commitment to do what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing, and I think the President was commending him on that.\xc2\xa0 He was not evaluating a success of it, but commending him on the remarkable efforts that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he agrees with Mr. Mueller, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a successful story?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the FBI director\xe2\x80\x99s remarks and I would point you to what the President said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
