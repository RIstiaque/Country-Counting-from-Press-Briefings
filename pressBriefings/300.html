EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 Some of you feel very far away.\xc2\xa0 Let me do two quick things at the top and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe first is, earlier today the President had been briefed on the spring storms that hit the Midwestern United States late in the day yesterday and early this morning.\xc2\xa0 In particular, our thoughts are prayers are with the people of Rochelle, Illinois and other communities in the Midwest that have been affected by these spring storms.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFEMA already has personnel in the region who are prepared to support the ongoing response that being\xe2\x80\x99s led by local officials.\xc2\xa0 FEMA has personnel that has an expertise in handling these kinds of events.\xc2\xa0 And we expect that, again, unfortunately this spring they\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to put that expertise to good work to meeting the needs of the people and local communities there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has asked for regular updates on this ongoing response, and we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly going to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the federal supplies and resources that are necessary to support ongoing local efforts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe second thing that I want to call to your attention that many of you have already reported on today is that later today the President will participate in a ceremony alongside executives from Copa Airlines and Boeing, as well as Panamanian President Varela at a signing of an agreement between Boeing and Copa about the purchase of those Boeing aircraft.\xc2\xa0 The deal, as many of you have already reported, is a $6.6 billion deal involving 61 different aircraft.\xc2\xa0 This is actually the largest commercial aviation deal in Latin America.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tImportantly, in the mind of President Obama, this will support 40,000 jobs back home, because we\xe2\x80\x99re not just talking about manufacturing at Boeing facilities; we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about engines that are made by GE, and medium-sized and even small businesses that are involved in this deal up and down the supply chain.\xc2\xa0 This is good news and it\xe2\x80\x99s a good reminder of how important opening up overseas markets to American businesses is a critical part of the U.S. economy and is going to be critically important to continuing to strengthen our ongoing economic recovery.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPanama is a place where we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen important growth since President Obama took office.\xc2\xa0 In just the last five years, exports to Panama have increased 70 percent.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is indicative of the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that opening up overseas markets to American goods and services can be very beneficial to our economy and can be important to creating good middle-class jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with all of that, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go to your questions, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll call on people.\xc2\xa0 And I anticipate many of your questions will be for Ben, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll let him step in and answer the foreign policy questions you may have.\xc2\xa0 But if there are any on other topics, we can take those too.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, Jim, do you want to get us started?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Ben, I wondered if you could bring us up to speed on kind of latest developments with Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Has the President reviewed the State Department recommendation on removing Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terror?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us a readout of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s phone call that the White House confirmed today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jim.\xc2\xa0 So, first of all, with respect to the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, the President initiated this review of Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s presence on the list as a part of the announcements he made on December 17th.\xc2\xa0 I think we have been very transparent about the process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat has taken place now is complete in terms of the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s work.\xc2\xa0 That review and recommendation is then passed for consideration to other members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team so that they can review the contents of the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s work.\xc2\xa0 And then, when that is complete, a final decision and recommendation will be made to the President, and he will make a determination about what action to take.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re not all the way through that process, but the review is complete.\xc2\xa0 This has gone to other members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team for their consideration.\xc2\xa0 And then a final recommendation will be forwarded to the President, and we will keep you updated as that process goes forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith respect to the phone call between President Obama and President Castro, they spoke on Wednesday in advance of the summit.\xc2\xa0 I think they understood that this is obviously a very unique occurrence in the Americas -- the first Summit of the Americas that Cuba is participating in, and that also our two governments are in a process of discussions about many aspects of our relationship, including the establishment of formal diplomatic relations and the opening of embassies.\xc2\xa0 And they understood as well that their foreign ministers -- Secretary Kerry and the Foreign Minister, Bruno Rodriguez, of Cuba -- would be meeting yesterday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo they were able to review the status of our efforts to complete the work of establishing those formal diplomatic relations, and also what the various issues were that were going to be addressed here at the summit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about that discussion that Kerry had with Foreign Minister Rodriguez last night?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been described as a lengthy discussion, and it seems a little bit curious that they would have these lengthy discussions and the President would have that conversation with President Castro, but this issue of the terror list, which is so important to the Cubans, would remain kind of an open question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 Well, the Cubans understand our process, and they essentially understand that the President will make a decision when all of the various elements of our review are completed.\xc2\xa0 So there is not really a cause for much discussion about the SSOT because, frankly, they understand that that is a process that the United States is undertaking.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would add that we are doing this review based not on a broader set of considerations about our relationship with Cuba.\xc2\xa0 The review looks at the very narrow question of is Cuba a state sponsor of terror; does Cuba provide support for terrorist attacks abroad; do they provide support for international terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0 And so on that narrow question, we\xe2\x80\x99ve completed the work of the review, and the President will make that final determination.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt the same time, we have a variety of issues that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking to the Cubans about that relate to the formal establishment of diplomatic relations through the opening of embassies.\xc2\xa0 The two leaders have decided to take that step of establishing diplomatic relations, but there are a lot of very practical issues that relate to establishing embassies that run the gamut from the types of operations that our various diplomats do, the types of resources that support both of our embassies.\xc2\xa0 So there are actually just very practical, specific and sometimes technical issues that we\'re reviewing with the Cubans as part of that process that Roberta Jacobson has been leading, but that Secretary Kerry has been engaged in, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the fact is that part of this process of normalization is communicating more regularly at different channels.\xc2\xa0 So again, not just at the Assistant Secretary level, but at the level of Secretary Kerry and President Obama.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo again, their discussion I think was largely focused on the issues associated with the establishment of the formal diplomatic relations and the opening of embassies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seems that a Summit of the Americas (inaudible) where you\xe2\x80\x99d want to showcase some kind of breakthrough.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree?\xc2\xa0 And have you set up a specific meeting with President Castro -- perhaps tomorrow -- that will show the rest of the hemisphere what the progress has been?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the fact of the summit and Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s participation of the summit I think already indicates the historical nature of this gathering, and the significant changes that were announced by the United States and Cuba in December, as does the first-of-its-kind civil society forum that\'s taking place here.\xc2\xa0 So I think you already see leaders across the region welcoming the decision that President Obama took both privately and publicly, as you saw with the CARICOM countries yesterday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith respect to the two Presidents, we certainly do anticipate that they will have the opportunity to see each other at the summit tomorrow to have a discussion.\xc2\xa0 So we will keep you updated as to any interaction between the leaders.\xc2\xa0 Again, we don\'t have a formal meeting scheduled at a certain time, but we certainly anticipate that they will have a discussion tomorrow in the context of the summit -- on the margins of that summit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly, on another subject.\xc2\xa0 Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Leader and President Rouhani are saying they will not sign a nuclear agreement unless all economic sanctions are lifted on the first day of the deal\xe2\x80\x99s implementation.\xc2\xa0 And Khamenei also said that no military facilities would be available for inspections.\xc2\xa0 Is that a deal -- is that kind of a nonstarter as far as the United States is concerned, or the P5?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, we have an agreement with the P5+1 and the Iranians on the framework of a comprehensive nuclear deal.\xc2\xa0 And on those two specific issues, with respect to sanctions I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very clear and understood that sanctions relief will be phased with respect to Iran; that they will have to conduct certain -- take certain steps as a part of earning the continued provision of sanctions relief.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere is one particular question that relates to U.N. Security Council resolutions.\xc2\xa0 And there, what we are working to do is to ensure that there is a maintenance of the ability to snap back into place sanctions on Iran on a multilateral basis.\xc2\xa0 But also, as we take the various different U.N. Security Council resolutions that form the basis of the multilateral sanctions, that the U.N. Security Council will replace that architecture of sanctions with a U.N. Security Council resolution that both endorses the comprehensive deal -- if we complete one -- but also, while providing sanctions relief to Iran, preserves important sanctions, including on areas that are not related to its nuclear program, like ballistic missile and sensitive technologies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is an area where we are working to finalize details between now and June 30th, as well as the provision of the ability for sanctions to snap back into place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCertainly the Iranians are emphasizing their interest and desire to achieve sanctions relief in this deal.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is we have a framework, and the President has said if the details don\'t bear out the agreement that was reached, we\'re not going to get a final deal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo what we will be testing over the next two and a half months as we seek to finalize the comprehensive deal is just how we can lock the framework into an implementation plan that gives us the assurance that Iran cannot pursue a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn the military sites, similarly, clearly there will have to be the ability for the IAEA to conduct inspections that are consistent with what\xe2\x80\x99s in the framework, which includes resolving past issues of concern with the IAEA related to possible military dimensions of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s program, as well as Iran joining the additional protocol and having the ability of the IAEA to inspect suspicious sites, no matter where they are, if the United States and other countries, again, present information and seek access through the IAEA to those sites.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President believes that the framework that was reached is a sound one, a good one, and that frankly we need to make sure that over the next two and a half months the details that are negotiated and the implementation plan that is negotiated locks in that framework.\xc2\xa0 And if the final deal isn\xe2\x80\x99t consistent with the framework that we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get there.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there is going to be the ability to work hard and complete this work if Iran continues to show a will to get this done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First up for you, Josh, and maybe Ben wants to comment on this, as well.\xc2\xa0 But on the possibility of a meeting between Raul Castro and President Obama, is it difficult for them to have a -- is it politically difficult for them to have a formal sit-down meeting, bilateral meeting as long as they continue to be on the terrorist list?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that has to be overcome before they can actually sit down in a bilateral?\xc2\xa0 Must it continue to be casual, sort of step-aside meetings until --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, Jim, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 The two leaders have made this decision to pursue normalization, recognizing that there are going to be all kinds of differences along the way.\xc2\xa0 There will be some areas that we can identify for practical cooperation and some areas of difference.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, the fact is we are nearing completion of the SSOT review.\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that that in any way should get in the way of the two leaders being able to have discussions.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken on the phone twice.\xc2\xa0 And in those discussions they\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly have areas of difference, just as they also I think will underscore that they\xe2\x80\x99re both committed to the new path that the United States and Cuba are on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you expect more than informal meetings then at this point?\xc2\xa0 Or are you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Jim, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 Frankly, a lot of this is just working around a schedule at the summit tomorrow in which there are various plenary sessions.\xc2\xa0 But at times, the President is able to step out and have meetings and discussions with other leaders, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated as we lock in more details related to his interactions with other leaders.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on the policy itself, in this new era of diplomacy, the President has repeatedly said that he believes engagement is the best way to effect change for the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 Does that change that the U.S. is looking for now continue to include regime change?\xc2\xa0 Or has the policy changed about that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, we\xe2\x80\x99re establishing -- we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to establishing diplomatic relations with the Cuban government.\xc2\xa0 So we are not focused on overthrowing the Cuban government.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not focused on changing the existing regime at a time when we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously engaging that government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think where there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference relates to our respective political systems.\xc2\xa0 And clearly, the United States is going to continue to have issues with, at times be critical of, elements of the Cuban political system.\xc2\xa0 And the types of things that we like to support and like to see around the world involve respect for freedom of assembly, political participation, the ability of citizens to access information.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo all of those values and principles we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to support, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve clearly made a decision to engage the Cuban government.\xc2\xa0 And while we have a complex history with Cuba, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s clearly understood here in the hemisphere is the United States is not in the business of going around and overthrowing governments in Latin America.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in the business of practical cooperation, and where we do have differences we articulate those clearly and directly and publicly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut again, we work within the context of a region that has been moving in the direction of democracy and greater development and prosperity.\xc2\xa0 So the trend lines are good.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, we believe our engagement with Cuba will certainly improve the lives of the Cuban people, and in no way does it change our commitment to seeing the values we believe in take hold across the Americas broadly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you envision Raul Castro assisting the United States in any way dealing with the Venezuelan issue here at this conference, which is a major issue for many of the other countries?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Venezuela is an issue where we clearly have at times found reasons to criticize the government\xe2\x80\x99s actions in terms of elected officials and opposition leaders being put in prison, for instance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated that we\xe2\x80\x99re open to a dialogue with Venezuela as well.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll make our positions very clear in that dialogue.\xc2\xa0 Cuba clearly has a close relationship with the Venezuelans.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think these are issues that frankly we can discuss directly with Venezuela as we recently did by having Tom Shannon, a senior State Department official, travel to Venezuela for a series of meetings.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo our principal way of communicating with Venezuela will be direct dialogue, even as we know that there are going to be differences between our two governments on a variety of issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMajor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For you, Josh and Ben.\xc2\xa0 So this meeting tomorrow -- under normal circumstances you would have preparatory lower-level meetings to lead to something.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair for us to conclude that the phone call -- the Secretary of State and Foreign Minister meeting yesterday were a prelude building up to whatever happens tomorrow, and that there is a desire to have something that is more substantive than a glancing encounter?\xc2\xa0 That this is going to be something where some business of some kind is going to be discussed between these two leaders?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, Josh, can you give us any kind of commitment to coverage or visibility of this?\xc2\xa0 Because it will obviously be enormously important (inaudible).\xc2\xa0 Then I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a follow-up on what happened here Wednesday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So again, depending on the nature of their discussion, we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly take into consideration the interest that folks will have in covering it.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly understand the historic nature of this summit generally, and any interaction between the two leaders.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly take that on-board, Major.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith respect to the preparatory work -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this process of normalization, there have been a series of discussions.\xc2\xa0 So over the course of the last several months, since the Presidents made their announcements, Roberta Jacobson, the Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere, has met a number of times with her Cuban counterpart in both Havana and in Washington.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry has spoken on the phone with the Cuban Foreign Minister.\xc2\xa0 We have other dialogues with the Cubans on a variety of issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there is actually a growing communication with the Cuban government that is consistent with normalizing relations.\xc2\xa0 And that includes, frankly, other issues too.\xc2\xa0 We, for instance, are very interested in supporting the development of greater telecommunications capacity inside of Cuba, which frankly would be good not just for U.S. businesses but for the Cuban people and their ability to access information.\xc2\xa0 The State Department had their lead advisor on telecommunications issues travel to Cuba.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s a range of issues where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in a dialogue with the Cubans.\xc2\xa0 So the two leaders, I think, will be able to address and take stock in any discussion they have -- where we are in the process of normalization; where we are in the discussions around the establishment of embassies; and where we are going to continue to have differences and be up front and candid about those differences.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFrankly, I think just the fact of the summit, too, and Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s participation does signal a new chapter in this region that is very broadly welcomed by the countries of the Americas.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that will be -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear other leaders tomorrow speaking to their support for the decision the President made.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Wednesday, there was a fracas here between Cuban dissidents and pro-Castro supporters.\xc2\xa0 The dissidents we talked to say that is an illustration that Cuba feels unencumbered; that it can quash dissent not only in Cuba but at the Summit of the Americas, and that flagrant use of force to beat up people who want to have a different opinion and want to have a political voice in Cuba ought to be renounced by the United States.\xc2\xa0 And from their perspective, the move toward normalizing relations is only going to feed the desire and the will of the Cuban regime to continue behavior like that.\xc2\xa0 How do you react to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, Major, first of all, we obviously renounce any use of violence to silence the voices of civil society activists and citizens, whether they be from Cuba or anywhere in the Americas.\xc2\xa0 On that particular incident, we expressed our serious concerns about the use of violence against those civil society representatives.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, how grossly inconsistent that was with the spirit of dialogue here in the Americas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe fact of the matter is though, Major, what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing at this summit is, those voices were not silenced.\xc2\xa0 They are participating on the margins of the Summit of the Americas and the Civil Society Forum.\xc2\xa0 They are, together with people from across the region, representing civil society who have differences of views.\xc2\xa0 And the view of the United States has always been there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to fear from civil society.\xc2\xa0 Civil society, on the contrary, has a fundamental role to play in all of our societies and all of our countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to speak out in support of the ability of independent voices in Cuba to be heard, the ability of people to speak freely without fear of intimidation.\xc2\xa0 And yes, we have seen regular patterns of harassment of civil society in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 But our very strong belief is that a policy that the United States had pursued for 50 years was not succeeding in many different ways, including in supporting a more positive environment within Cuba for civil society; and that, frankly, U.S. engagement with the Cuban people over the long run is going to improve circumstances for the Cuban people, is going to give them greater access to information, is going to give them greater interconnection with the rest of the hemisphere and the rest of the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo our strategy of engagement with Cuba is not only entirely consistent with our support for civil society; it, frankly, is a better way of being able to engage a broad cross-section of the Cuban people as they seek to improve their own lives and their own connections with the United States and the people of the Americas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick question about the phone call on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us how long it lasted, and also just give us some more details about what they actually talked about?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, they discussed the continued efforts that we were making with respect to the establishment of diplomatic relations.\xc2\xa0 They discussed the upcoming summit and the ongoing conversations that Secretary Kerry is leading with his counterpart, both on the diplomatic relations and with respect to the summit.\xc2\xa0 And they reviewed the fact that we\'re going to continue to have areas of common cooperation but also areas of difference.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo again, I think they touched on the different elements of the normalization process and the nature of the U.S.-Cuban relationship.\xc2\xa0 And I think it was a good opportunity to set a clear direction for the continued discussions that Secretary Kerry would have with Foreign Minister Rodriguez.\xc2\xa0 And as we come to the summit that is truly historic in nature, that is the first time Cuba is participating in Summit of the Americas, it made sense for the two of them to be in contact as we prepared for the various interactions we were going to have both with Cuba here and with other leaders from the hemisphere.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long did it last?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t give you a specific time.\xc2\xa0 It was not a particularly lengthy call.\xc2\xa0 We can go back and check, and I can let you know if we can be more specific.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Toluse.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you let us know who initiated the call?\xc2\xa0 Was it the Cubans?\xc2\xa0 Was it the President?\xc2\xa0 Who decided to make this call?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it was a mutual decision because we are in discussions with Cuba in a variety of channels.\xc2\xa0 We certainly thought it was a good idea for there to be a phone call between the leaders so we could make clear where we are in terms of our efforts, where we see potential for progress, where we need to continue to stress that there are going to be differences between our governments.\xc2\xa0 So I think it emerged out of the discussions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having with the Cuban government, and the timing on the eve of the summit was appropriate for both sides.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, have the Cubans actually requested a meeting?\xc2\xa0 Have they asked for a sit-down with the President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in contact with the Cubans, and they certainly -- as we are -- they\'re certainly expecting that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to find a time for the two leaders to have that discussion on the margins of the Summit of the Americas.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just continue to work through the details of how we can structure that interaction consistent with the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing series of plenary sessions that the two leaders are participating in.\xc2\xa0 But we, from the level of Secretary Kerry on down, have a variety of ways of having that conversation with the Cubans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick one on the Iranian negotiations and the Ayatollah\xe2\x80\x99s comments yesterday.\xc2\xa0 In the past, Josh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that President Rouhani has basically missed -- he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on one area of the agreement, but yesterday the Ayatollah basically said that the framework that you all put out was misleading and that it lied.\xc2\xa0 How do you sort of react to that, that ratcheting up of the commentary?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So I think what I\xe2\x80\x99d say is this.\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Leader has said many, many things over the years that we have strong objections to.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is, if you go back and look at the Joint Plan of Action, the interim agreement that we reached with the Iranians, there was a similar dynamic in the sense that we reached a Joint Plan of Action in November of 2013.\xc2\xa0 We released information about that Joint Plan of Action knowing that we still had to finalize the implementation details which were not done until January.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn that period of time between November and January, the Iranians criticized the information we put out, and they said that it did not reflect the deal.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is, they then implemented the deal.\xc2\xa0 The details that were negotiated reflected the Joint Plan of Action, and they have abided by every commitment that they made to the United States and the P5+1 in the Joint Plan of Action.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this before where the Iranians clearly want to highlight certain aspects for their own public.\xc2\xa0 They have their own hardliners who are skeptical of this deal.\xc2\xa0 But that cannot change the facts of what not just the United States, but the P5+1 agreed to in terms of this framework in Lausanne.\xc2\xa0 And the test of whether or not that framework can be memorialized in a deal is not going to be a comment on any given day by a particular Iranian leader.\xc2\xa0 The test is going to be whether, if at the end of June we have a document that is agreed to that is able to be presented, that represents what is necessary for us to meet our core objectives of preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and having the type of inspections and transparency that can verify that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you go ahead and just tell us what the State Department is recommending on the list of state sponsors of terrorism?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So, Jim, the President will be the one who has to make the final judgment about a recommendation, so we won\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge his decision by getting into what the State Department document says.\xc2\xa0 But again, what I would say is the question in this process is does Cuba provide support for terrorism? Have they engaged in actions, and are they currently providing support for international terrorist organizations?\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a very specific question.\xc2\xa0 And the President will be guided and looking at the review by the facts, by the specific question of does Cuba act as a state sponsor of terrorism.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, look, there may be instances in history where Cuba has certainly done things and supported acts of violence that the United States strongly objects to, but the reason why there\xe2\x80\x99s a process to review a country\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion on that list is because circumstances change, and we need to regularly reassess whether or not a country should still be on the list or, frankly, whether there\xe2\x80\x99s a country that isn\xe2\x80\x99t on the list that should be on the list.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge the decision, but I think it is important to highlight that this is focused specifically on the factual question of Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with terrorism and its commitment to not provide support for terrorism.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the meeting that you\xe2\x80\x99re saying should take place tomorrow, the encounter, interaction -- whatever you want to call it -- would you put this on the same level as the last high-level encounter between a Cuban and U.S. leader going back to Vice President Nixon and Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro in 1959, and before that Eisenhower and Batista?\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair comparison to make in terms of what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be seeing tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Or is this going to be so fast, it really just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meet that kind of standard?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair comparison, Jim.\xc2\xa0 And look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve already had the first interaction, first meeting between our foreign ministers since 1958.\xc2\xa0 That happened last night.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had the first phone calls between the President of the United States and the President of Cuba certainly that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of since a similar timeframe.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re in new territory here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the reason we\'re here, though, is because the President strongly believes that an approach that was focused entirely on isolation, focused entirely on seeking to cut off the Cuban people from the United States of America had failed, and that a policy of engagement won\xe2\x80\x99t just lead to the ability to work with the Cuban government in some areas, it will lead to much greater engagement with the Cuban people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd even just over the course of the last several months, we\'re seeing things that would have been unimaginable a year ago.\xc2\xa0 Because of the restrictions that the President changed, the policy changes that he\xe2\x80\x99s already made, you have Airbnb setting up a business in Cuba so that people can travel there and stay in Cuban homes, which is good for Americans and good for the Cuban people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou have direct air links that are going to be established so people can travel directly to Cuba from the United States.\xc2\xa0 You have very important, symbolic efforts like the NBA traveling down to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Much greater interaction and people-to-people exchanges already.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is not just about two leaders sitting down together, it\xe2\x80\x99s about fundamentally changing how the United States engages Cuba -- its government, its people, its civil society.\xc2\xa0 All of that is reflected here at the summit.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that will have a profoundly positive impact not just for our own interests, but for the Cuban people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you one on Iran?\xc2\xa0 Are you guys going to be okay in being able to deal if they do come up with a veto-proof majority in the Senate to give Corker -- the Corker bill the ability to provide a check on whatever deal -- is that something that you -- I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to if they do come up with that veto-proof majority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to prejudge what may happen in Congress.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know, Josh, if you want to add anything to this.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is, next week we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the ability to brief Congress on the framework.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have the ability to explain why certain actions by Congress in this very sensitive negotiating period would be counterproductive to getting the deal done.\xc2\xa0 That will involve Secretary Kerry.\xc2\xa0 That will involve Secretary Moniz.\xc2\xa0 That will involve other members of our national security team.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think what we\xe2\x80\x99d say to Congress is:\xc2\xa0 We understand you have a role to play.\xc2\xa0 We respect your interest in Iran policy and the need for there to be a congressional oversight of the deal, but here\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe that this window of time needs to be protected in terms of there not being actions that are counterproductive, and why we believe we\'re working towards a good deal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd if and when there are votes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll deal with that.\xc2\xa0 But frankly, we\'re not at that point yet.\xc2\xa0 We\'re at a point of consulting with different members of Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I think the only thing I would to add to that is it\xe2\x80\x99s just important to remember, even as we evaluate potential congressional activity, is this is not an agreement just between Iran and the United States, but this is an agreement between Iran and the broader international community.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important that Congress, even as they -- as Ben pointed out -- take actions that are consistent with their rightful role of having oversight over the deal also recognize that international unity has been critical to our success in applying pressure to Iran and getting them to make the kinds of important commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already made to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapons.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on Major\xe2\x80\x99s question about the scuffle.\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) some folks from Miami (inaudible).\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday you said that -- you expressed concern over certain leaders of civil society.\xc2\xa0 Can you be any more specific about what was said or who you spoke with, or who (inaudible)?\xc2\xa0 Can you just put a little more context to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we spoke publicly at the time and expressed our serious concern over that incident.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly been able to make clear to the Cuban government our concerns about that incident.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve also been able to speak to Cuban civil society and other civil society members.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is a regional Civil Society Forum -- so it\'s not just Cuban participants, but there are people from across the region -- to encourage a respectful dialogue that is consistent with the spirit of the Summit of the Americas, which should be a place for all the people of the region to come together, not because they\xe2\x80\x99re going to agree on everything, but because having this type of platform for dialogue is in our interest.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, this is a unique occurrence in terms of the Civil Society Forum.\xc2\xa0 This is the first time there\xe2\x80\x99s been a forum like this at a Summit of the Americas; certainly been the first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve had Cuban participation in that summit.\xc2\xa0 That would include people who are supportive of the government and certainly people who are critical of the government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think, Chris, the important thing is that incident took place; it\'s not inconsistent with incidents you hear about in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 But the Civil Society Forum went on.\xc2\xa0 People continued to have their voices heard.\xc2\xa0 People were still able to participate and interact with civil society from across the region.\xc2\xa0 So, again, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t diminish our concern over what happened, but I think it indicates that people\xe2\x80\x99s voices are going to be heard in the end, and resorting to violence and intimidation in 2015 is not going to be sufficient when people want to have their voices heard and want to have a venue to participate with their civil society colleagues from across the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to the point of what you talked about -- areas of difference and why some of the folks who were involved with that would call the violations of human rights that are ongoing in Cuba, and that\'s why they oppose this normalization of relations.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the message?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the message specifically to Raul Castro?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think in terms of differences between our government, we have been very clear that we\'re going to continue to speak up for human rights, and we\'re going to continue to have differences as it relates to the nature of Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s political system -- just as I would fully anticipate the Cuban government to make clear its opposition to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 ongoing presence at Guantanamo Bay, for instance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo normalization is a process.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve already changed a lot about our relationship just in the last several months in terms of much greater high-level dialogue and much greater engagement with the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 I think the next major step is certainly the establishment of diplomatic relations and the opening of embassies as it relates to the normalization process.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there\xe2\x80\x99s still not going to be these fundamental tensions that exist.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur question is, is it better to address our differences as it relates to human rights in Cuba by not talking to the Cuban government, by cutting ourselves off from the Cuban people, and by clinging to a policy of isolation that has failed for 50 years, or is it better to give us much greater engagement with the Cuban people and Cuban government to make our views known.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, when we look at Americans, particularly Cuban Americans, or even folks within that country who oppose the direction that the administration is taking, do you see it as largely generational?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes -- I think, Chris, first of all, if you look at any sampling of American opinion since the President made his announcement, you see very broad support for what he\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at the Cuban American community, it is very understandable that people of an older generation who recall some very difficult times with the revolution and with the differences between our governments throughout the Cold War, that they might take a much more skeptical view of turning the page to this new chapter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut as you say, you also see a great openness among Cuban Americans, and particularly younger Cuban Americans, for a new approach of engagement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd look, part of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened here is the President, when he took office, lifted restrictions on the ability of Cuban Americans to travel to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 So you had Cuban Americans going down to the island in ways that they were not able to before.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, that only increased their support for engagement, because they got down there and they saw that their ability to interact with Cubans, their ability to see what was taking place on the island was a positive development; that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be walled off from interaction with Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And very importantly, the most important survey that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen recently is the one that said that 97 percent of Cubans support normalization.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo where we\xe2\x80\x99ve always agreed, even with our critics, is on the notion that U.S. policy should support the aspirations of the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 Well, if 97 percent of the Cuban people want this normalization, how would it be supporting the Cuban people to deny them this normalization?\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a message that I think we\xe2\x80\x99d be comfortable making and delivering anywhere in the United States to any of our critics, which is to say we share your concern about the situation that the Cuban people face; we share your concerns about some of the restrictions that the Cuban people face.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut if the Cuban people are telling us almost uniformly that they think this policy should change and they want greater engagement with the United States, we have to listen to them, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About the review of the terror list, are you saying that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be an announcement during the summit indicating whether Cuba will be removed from the list or not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think what -- we will continue to be transparent with you about how this process moves forward.\xc2\xa0 Again, right now it\xe2\x80\x99s in the final stages in terms of members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team having a chance to review the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s work.\xc2\xa0 It will come to the President when that\xe2\x80\x99s complete.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99m not ruling out any announcement, but I am saying that we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet in terms of a final recommendation being given to the President and the President making a determination.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not complete at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Carol.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is for Ben.\xc2\xa0 One of Castro\xe2\x80\x99s aides said yesterday that while the terrorism designation is great and everything, it\xe2\x80\x99s really going to require the U.S. to lift the embargo, to give back Gitmo, among other things.\xc2\xa0 Can you address that?\xc2\xa0 And can you give a sense of what you guys see as the timing for getting Congress to act on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So, look, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t in any way surprise me that the Cuban government wants the embargo lifted and wants a variety of changes to take place.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, though, that -- I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we mean when we talk about normalization is a process.\xc2\xa0 The establishment of diplomatic relations and the commitment to open embassies, that\xe2\x80\x99s a decision that the leaders have taken, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a discussion we\xe2\x80\x99re having with Cuba on very specific and technical and practical issues about how two embassies can operate in Havana and in the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEven after we open an embassy in Cuba, there is still going to be the congressionally imposed embargo in place and there is still going to be a U.S. presence at Guantanamo that Cuba objects to just as there\xe2\x80\x99s still going to be a Cuban political system in place that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find much cause to criticize at certain points.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHowever, the clear direction from the President is that we need to be moving in the direction of greater and greater and greater engagement, not just with the government but with the people.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s where the embargo comes in, because the people who have suffered significantly under the embargo include ordinary Cubans who are not able to engage with the United States.\xc2\xa0 So the President has called on Congress to begin the work of lifting the embargo.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are efforts underway in Congress in different aspects of that.\xc2\xa0 So, for instance, there\xe2\x80\x99s an effort underway to lift the travel ban on Americans traveling to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 We think that is something that would get very broad support in the United States.\xc2\xa0 Why should Americans be denied the ability to travel to Cuba?\xc2\xa0 There are efforts underway to lift some of the restrictions as it relates to agricultural, commercial activity in Cuba, and there are efforts to lift the embargo all together.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd look, while we know that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen in the immediate term, what we see is bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress for the policy the President is pursuing.\xc2\xa0 And if we are demonstrating that engagement is moving forward, has the support of the American people, has the support of the Cuban people, and is helping to support improvements in the life of the Cuban people, I think those coalitions will grow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd just as it was very hard to foresee a year ago that we\xe2\x80\x99d be standing here with Cuba at the summit and the commitment to establish diplomatic relations and all kinds of ties between our people, I think it could change very fast.\xc2\xa0 And you could see congressional action in different aspects in the next -- certainly within the next several years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The terrorist designation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, just for the Congress to do something.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, we would like Congress to do something as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 But I think realistically looking at it -- look, I think if you look at something like lifting the travel ban, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen very soon because Americans want to travel to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And I think there will be opposition to that in Congress, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make a prediction about anything with respect to how fast Congress will act on a certain matter.\xc2\xa0 But I do think what you\xe2\x80\x99ll see is there\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan support for that action, there\xe2\x80\x99s support from the American people for that action.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll make a case for it.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, it\'s up to Congress as to when they\xe2\x80\x99re able to move that through.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKevin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 Just housekeeping first.\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, Thursday there was no phone call between President Obama and Raul Castro?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 So there have been different reports.\xc2\xa0 The only call was on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 They have spoken twice -- once before the announcement December 17th, and the other was Wednesday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mention opposition and perhaps some bipartisan support as well in Congress.\xc2\xa0 Senators Menendez and Rubio have been very forceful in their opposition to this.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to them as they try to represent the constituents who look at the Castro regime as one that has a long track record of human rights abuses, as you pointed out; imprisonment of local dissidents -- property?\xc2\xa0 How do you square this sort of compartmentalization?\xc2\xa0 You know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve done some of these things, you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of it, and yet you seem consistent in your push to try to normalize the relationship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, as I said, we\xe2\x80\x99d point out that the American people support this change, Cuban-Americans increasingly support this change, and the Cuban people overwhelmingly support this change in U.S. policy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo if our concern is what can we be doing that is best for the Cuban people, if the clear indication is did you have 97 percent of the Cuban people supporting normalization, as the recent survey indicated, that signals that we should be moving in a new direction.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe second thing is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried this approach for 50 years and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\xc2\xa0 All the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve objected to in Cuba were happening over the course of the last several decades.\xc2\xa0 And our policy was in no way changing that.\xc2\xa0 Those practices by the Cuban government were ongoing, despite the embargo, despite the isolation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd this new approach we believe is better -- a better way to improve things on the island; to improve conditions for the Cuban people; to engage with not just the government, but the Cuban people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd look, the last thing I\xe2\x80\x99d say here is we understand that people are going to have differences; we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect everybody to agree with what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 But we share the same objective in the sense that we want to see life on the island improve.\xc2\xa0 We believe that that will happen -- that it\'s much more likely to happen through engagement, and that engagement has to include the Cuban government.\xc2\xa0 And things are changing there.\xc2\xa0 You do see incremental but important economic reforms that are opening up some space for the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 We want to encourage those reforms, and I think removing ourselves entirely from the conversation with the Cuban people and the Cuban government is not the most effective way to encourage reform.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Do you have an example in history, whether it be from an American perspective or another perspective, of where you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this turn out positively?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly you have many examples of the United States being engaged with governments that we have profound differences with, and supporting an evolution of those governments over time.\xc2\xa0 Here in the Americas, there are any number of countries that had very authoritarian models in place that evolved into democracies who we would now fully welcome and embrace as members in good standing of the community of democracies -- whether you look at Chile or Argentina, or a variety of other countries in Central America who went through very painful periods -- some of whom we had relations with, some of whom were adversarial to us, some of whom we supported.\xc2\xa0 But our general view is that the trend lines in the Americas are moving in the direction of democracy, and U.S. engagement is a better way of promoting that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, look, even around the world, we have relations with countries that are constructive where we have not yet seen a transformation.\xc2\xa0 With Vietnam, for instance.\xc2\xa0 The United States initiated diplomatic relations with Vietnam, even though they were a one-party state.\xc2\xa0 That has certainly led to an improvement in terms of U.S. interests in Southeast Asia, U.S. commerce with Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s led to an improvement in the lives of the Vietnamese people.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s still a political progression that has not taken place in Vietnam, and we speak out when we see human rights violations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo if the United States refused to have diplomatic relations with every country in the world that committed human rights abuses, or that we had difference with respect to their political system, we would stop talking to a lot of people, and we would lose the ability to seek to move those countries in a more constructive direction.\xc2\xa0 Singling out Cuba in the way that we have, in our view, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of sense.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on Venezuela.\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) we hear from some of the foreign ministers that the U.S. should step back from its declaration of Venezuela being part of the national security threat?\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) procedural issue as to why it was put on that list.\xc2\xa0 Is there any chance the U.S. might find some way of going back to that (inaudible)?\xc2\xa0 Because clearly it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a long tradition in the hemisphere of concerns related to the use of certain tools, including sanctions.\xc2\xa0 What the United States has made clear is that there are going to be circumstances around the world where we have to criticize governments when they\'re engaged in activities like putting opposition leaders in prison.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThese sanctions that were imposed were focused very specifically on a number of individuals associated with human rights violations.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear is that these sanctions were not imposed because we thought Venezuela threatens the security of the United States, and that the United States is not interested in threatening Venezuela or overthrowing its government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think you will find broad support in the hemisphere for the notion that Venezuela does have a series of internal challenges that have to be dealt with.\xc2\xa0 The countries in the region have been trying to support and promote dialogue within Venezuela.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been supportive of their efforts in doing so because instability in Venezuela is not good for the region, just as it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the Venezuelan people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing, though, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve signaled is, look, even as we\'re going to be critical, we\'re not opposed to dialogue.\xc2\xa0 We have a dialogue with the Venezuelan government where we lay out our concerns and can address a variety of issues.\xc2\xa0 And I think that varied approach is something that is well understood in the hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a constructive tone taken by many of the leaders on this issue, even if, as a general matter, many countries in the hemisphere are not supportive of the use of sanctions in any case, whether it be Venezuela or other issues around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Julie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) -- talked about in the first Summit of the Americas that he attended.\xc2\xa0 So I wonder whether you can just characterize for us the President\xe2\x80\x99s sort of state of mind as he watches all of these developments unfold here this week -- the phone call, the meeting with Kerry, his own meeting with Castro.\xc2\xa0 Does he feel impatient?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel frustrated that it\xe2\x80\x99s taking a long time?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel vindicated?\xc2\xa0 And how determined is he to sort of push this ahead quickly, given that potentially this could all -- a lot of this could be rolled back, with the exception of the congressionally imposed pieces after he\xe2\x80\x99s gone from office?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think the President feels very confident that this is the right course and that it\'s already bearing fruit.\xc2\xa0 Again, because of the announcement we made, and then the policy and regulatory changes we made, you\'re already seeing commercial activity in Cuba, U.S. business delegations, increased travel and people-to-people exchanges.\xc2\xa0 That is all already taking off, and it\'s very heartening.\xc2\xa0 And all the reports you hear back from Cuba relate to the fact that the Cuban people just want more and more of that engagement.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re hungry for it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so I think the President, number one, is very pleased to see activity taking place of its own accord, including outside of governments, including by businesses, state governments, and others reaching out and engaging in the Cuban people in ways that are going to make life better and also advance our own interests.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSecond, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s very pleased that there\xe2\x80\x99s enormous support for this in the hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 The last Summit of the Americas we were at, the only thing we talked about was why the United States was opposing Cuba participating in the Summit of the Americas, or why we were still maintaining our policy of isolation.\xc2\xa0 Our Cuba policy, instead of isolating Cuba was isolating the United States in our own backyard.\xc2\xa0 And that has been the trend over many years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis time we arrive here, yes, not agreeing with everybody about everything, so certainly on an issue like Venezuela we\'ve had differences with the Venezuelan government, but I think you find very broad agreement from the leaders here that what the President did is the right thing and it\'s going to open up the door not just to greater engagement with Cuba, but potentially I think more constructive relations across the hemisphere generally.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think with respect to the timing of the work with the Cuban government, the President said in December, change is not going to come overnight to Cuba because we made this announcement.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to have the political system that we have significant problems with, just as they\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to criticize aspects of our foreign policy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I think what he wants to see is, is this moving forward. Can we demonstrate that there\xe2\x80\x99s a process of normalization that is moving forward both in terms of U.S. nongovernmental activity and outreach to the Cuban people, but also our consultations with the Cuban government, our ability to cooperate with them on certain issues, our ability to work through the issues associated with setting up embassies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo as long as we see forward motion here, we know there will be setbacks, there will be things that we strongly object to that the Cuban government does, but if the general direction of our policy is yielding change, increasing engagement with the Cuban people, that\'s something the President I think is going to feel very confident and positive about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us at what event today President Obama and President Castro will be in the same room together with the opportunity to exchange greetings, shake hands?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The only events that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be together today are the arrival ceremony associated with the summit, and then the leaders dinner.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the same room for those events.\xc2\xa0 It\'s possible certainly that they\xe2\x80\x99ll see each other there.\xc2\xa0 I would not anticipate an extended discussion between the two leaders tonight.\xc2\xa0 If that happens it\'s going to happen tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99ll be together with the other leaders at the arrival ceremony and the dinner tonight.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will also be with other Cubans earlier in the day when he\xe2\x80\x99s at the Civil Society Forum.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s speaking to the broad Civil Society Forum, which has included both strong, independent critics of the Cuban government, but also supporters of the Cuban government.\xc2\xa0 And then he\'ll be having a roundtable discussion, the President will, with a number of civil society representatives from across the region.\xc2\xa0 And that will include Cuban participation as well as other countries.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll be joined at that civil society roundtable by the leaders of Uruguay and Costa Rica.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have three questions.\xc2\xa0 First of all, is there something that the President is waiting for to either request or accept a bilat meeting?\xc2\xa0 Does something have to happen?\xc2\xa0 Is there something that he\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for?\xc2\xa0 Is too early something that would be good or bad, or is that considered?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want people to kind of overthink this in the sense that a lot of this is just about the fact that we\'ll be setting up discussions with other leaders on the margins of the summit tomorrow at the same time that there are ongoing plenary discussions.\xc2\xa0 So a lot of this is -- it\'s not conditional on policy.\xc2\xa0 It\'s how do we work through the ability for him to have discussions with a variety of different leaders in the context of that summit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'ll keep you updated on timing, but it\'s a good question in the sense that, no, he\xe2\x80\x99s not conditioning a discussion with Cuba on some breakthrough on a certain policy issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I was going to ask about Venezuela.\xc2\xa0 Venezuela has been very loud about gathering signatures, bringing them to the summit to ask the Obama administration to withdraw the executive order.\xc2\xa0 Has this administration actually communicated directly to the White House to ask for that?\xc2\xa0 Or is that kind of just a lot of just chatter that that administration is making?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s always a lot of chatter out of Venezuela.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that our criticism of Venezuela has been focused very specifically on a set of human rights concerns and actions and is not suggestive of some U.S. desire to overthrow the Venezuelan government, number one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNumber two, we have had a chance to have a dialogue with them.\xc2\xa0 Tom Shannon, who has a lot of experience in the region, very senior official at the State Department, was able to go to Caracas, meet with Venezuelan officials, have a discussion in advance of the summit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then lastly, President Obama, from the beginning of his time in office, made it clear here in Latin America that he\xe2\x80\x99s not focused on or interested in having a bunch of ideological debates that have shaped the polities of the hemisphere in the past.\xc2\xa0 We can argue ad nauseam about what took place in the \xe2\x80\x9860s, the \xe2\x80\x9870s, the \xe2\x80\x9880s.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s all kinds of different ideological perspectives on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on is what type of practical cooperation can we forge in the hemisphere, and then how can we make sure that generally the hemisphere is moving in the direction of greater democracy, greater development, greater collaboration.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be our posture as it relates to Venezuela and all the other issues on the agenda.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, finally, on Brazil, I understand that the Brazilian President (inaudible) respond during the summit to the U.S. invitation to come back and visit D.C.\xc2\xa0 Has she responded yet?\xc2\xa0 Do you have an answer from her?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we have a specific answer, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly be talking to Dilma Rousseff tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99ll be one of the leaders that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he has a discussion with at the summit and on the margins of the summit, and one of the issues will be a potential visit.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated on any timing announcements.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll just do two more and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll call it a wrap.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Ben.\xc2\xa0 You said that the deal that President Obama announced almost four years [sic] ago is bearing fruit.\xc2\xa0 In your opinion, do the Cuban people have more freedom today than they did on December 16th, a day before the deal was announced?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So you said years, but it\'s months.\xc2\xa0 Okay, so, look, I think that the Cuban people are more hopeful about the future than when this was announced.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of Cubans who were released from prison -- political prisoners who were released in December and January; as a part of that agreement, the Cubans took the decision to release individuals whose cases we had raised with them.\xc2\xa0 That was clearly a positive development.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI do think you see greater energy within Cuba around issues of civil society, and discussion and debate.\xc2\xa0 So I think the trend lines are positive with respect to how the Cuban people are looking at their future and our ability to engage the Cuban people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCuba is not going to change from a closed one-party state to a liberal democracy overnight, nor would we expect that to happen.\xc2\xa0 So this is going to be a process over time.\xc2\xa0 But in our view, the trend lines are positive.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there are not things that concern us.\xc2\xa0 And we said it on December 17th, there were going to continue to be incidents that take place in Cuba that we would find cause to criticize, that we fully expected that.\xc2\xa0 But we want to make sure that our engagement is pushing the trends in general in a positive direction for the Cuban people, and for the United States and the Cuban government to figure out ways to address our differences and cooperate in areas of common interest.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So (inaudible) -- you would say if the Cuban people have more freedom today than they do -- than they did, rather, on December the 16th?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest -- yes, I think they are better off in terms of the people who are released from prison, in terms of their optimism for the future.\xc2\xa0 But I really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest that we believe Cuba has somehow transformed itself over those last four months.\xc2\xa0 This is going to be a very long process of normalization, and the reforms and evolution that\xe2\x80\x99s going to take place on the island is going to play out over time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe question is, are our policies going to make it more likely that that evolution moves in a positive direction for the Cuban people, that brings them greater opportunity, greater human rights.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the trends show that, yes, they are moving in a more positive direction.\xc2\xa0 But that in no way means that there are not still practices in Cuba that are entirely inconsistent with how we support universal human rights around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one final one, on Iran, if I may.\xc2\xa0 In the past two days, the White House put out a tweet which seemed to parody in some way a Iran bomb diagram that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu showed in a speech that he gave at the General Assembly of the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 In your view, that tweet, is this effective diplomacy as it relates to Israel?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99d say is, first of all, obviously the United States and Israel have an unshakeable alliance that is rooted in shared interest, shared values, and is on display in our security cooperation, in our diplomatic cooperation, and a range of issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\'s a secret to anybody in this room that the United States and Israel have had very sharp differences as it relates to these Iran negotiations, with respect to the first agreement that was reached and with respect to this framework. Prime Minister Netanyahu has issued very strong criticisms of this deal, as have members of his administration.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s entirely his right.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re also going to issue strong defenses of this deal.\xc2\xa0 It would make no sense for us to essentially not make our case because of disagreements that have been expressed by the government of Israel.\xc2\xa0 And we have these conversations in private with the Israelis as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe fact of the matter is -- that was a very specific question.\xc2\xa0 If you look at the graphic that Prime Minister Netanyahu held up at the United Nations, it spoke to an accumulation of stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that stockpile has been eliminated under even the first step agreement.\xc2\xa0 And the stockpile of lower-enriched uranium is going to be almost entirely eliminated as well, as a part of the comprehensive deal -- 97 percent -- just as we\xe2\x80\x99re also aiming to cut off the various other pathways to a nuclear weapon that Iran could pursue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody should be surprised that the United States and Israel, despite our very strong alliance and friendship and cooperation on many issues, are going to continue to be public in terms of expressing our views of the Iran deal.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll be making our case, just as Prime Minister Netanyahu and his administration have regularly made their views known.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what other bilateral meetings the President might be having tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So I definitely expect the President to see and meet with President Santos tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 That, too, again, the timing we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be more specific with you as the summit events unfold.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly talk to President Santos.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPresident Santos has been very supportive of the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement on Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Frankly, we are also now increasingly engaged in supporting the peace process between the Colombian government and the FARC.\xc2\xa0 That includes discussions that are being hosted in Havana.\xc2\xa0 And our new envoy to those peace talks has traveled to Havana as part of those discussions to provide support to the Colombian government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think that the peace process with the Colombian government and the FARC is indicative of a potential transformational change in the region that could take place in ending one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s longest-running conflicts, if not the world\xe2\x80\x99s longest-running conflicts.\xc2\xa0 And Cuba has played a constructive role in that process.\xc2\xa0 And that speaks I think to how Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Colombia and the Colombian government has evolved.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think President Santos will be supportive in any way he can of progress in U.S.-Cuban relations.\xc2\xa0 And he is somebody, again, who -- we share a deep history and shared values with Colombia as a democracy in the hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 I think it points to the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely consistent to stand up for and support democratic values and also to believe that engagement with governments that act inconsistently with those values is a better way of promoting positive change and promoting the human rights we care about here in the Americas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Venezuela, has he offered to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\'m sorry, I was so focused on Cuba.\xc2\xa0 No, not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I think that clearly also associated with their ongoing efforts with the FARC, and obviously being neighbors, they have had concerns, differences with the Venezuelan government, but have also pursued dialogue with the Venezuela government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99d expect President Santos to be supportive of dialogue, but also supportive of, as he has been in the past, a process in the region whereby different countries can support a dialogue within Venezuela to include the government and the opposition that can help stabilize the situation.\xc2\xa0 Because I think what is of broad concern in the region is the potential economic impact that could be associated with growing instability inside of Venezuela.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that provides a strong basis for the countries to have an interest in stability.\xc2\xa0 And I think stability does depend on a dialogue and a process within Venezuela that can lower tensions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hillary is going to announce on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 Will the President support the former Secretary of State or the White House staffers who are going to work for her?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me start by saying that I think that after an hour and 15 minutes, this concludes the most focused Summit of the Americas briefing that\'s ever been conducted in the history of the Summit of the Americas.\xc2\xa0 So let me compliment all of you on that and let you know that we welcome your interest.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI had read those reports about a possible campaign announcement over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll wait and see what happens.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, everybody.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:00 P.M.
