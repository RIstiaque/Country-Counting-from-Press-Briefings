EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 I want to see if I see anyone out there who came with us to Texas yesterday.\xc2\xa0 It was a long -- were you there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the charter --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, on the charter.\xc2\xa0 So if you\'re like me, you\'re dragging a little bit.\xc2\xa0 So I have no opening announcements or statements.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll go right to questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A couple topics.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a bit about the agenda today of the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Senate Democrats?\xc2\xa0 Obviously a different type of meeting, having all the Senate caucus down here, Democratic caucus.\xc2\xa0 What does he specifically want to accomplish?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He very much wants to discuss the ways that we need to approach the problem of long-term deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he put forward his plan for that a number of weeks ago and looks forward to meeting first with Senate Democrats and then with Senate Republicans, later with House Republicans and House Democrats, to discuss this issue because it\xe2\x80\x99s very much high on his agenda.\xc2\xa0 And he, as you know because of the talks he initiated, led by the Vice President, wants to move forward and get some -- find some common ground with Republicans on long-term deficit reduction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are these -- I mean, do you envision that these will be, in a sense, sort of negotiation sessions, what can we get through?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t expect the full caucus in any of these situations to be negotiating sessions, but trading of ideas, listening to approaches and, broadly speaking, strategizing for how -- in all of these sessions, with Republicans and Democrats -- for how we get from here to there, where we can find common ground; since we all agree on what the problem is, which is always very important, and that is the need to bring down our deficits and deal with our long-term debt, and we all agree generally on the target, which is reducing our deficits by $4 trillion over 10 to 12 years, how do we find those elements that we can agree on to move this ball down the field.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to doing this.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he appointed his fiscal commission last year, the Bowles-Simpson commission.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he has put deficit reduction in his budget proposals as well as long-term plan, and why he asked the Vice President to lead these serious negotiations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 One other topic.\xc2\xa0 On the draft executive order that would require contractors to disclose contributions -- I know you said that is a draft and going through the process, but I just wanted to check in.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that the White House still is planning to do, still stands behind?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a draft process.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new to say about it or a timetable for when it might emerge.\xc2\xa0 I will make the point, as I have in the past, that drafts are drafts.\xc2\xa0 As you know, when you write a draft of your story, the story, the language in the story can change, and the language in a draft executive order can change as it moves through the process.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- principle to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the principle of disclosure is one the President stands strongly behind.\xc2\xa0 And again, speaking broadly and not specifically about this executive order, he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that, especially in this day and age after the Supreme Court decision about campaign donations, that the American people should know who is funding our political campaigns.\xc2\xa0 And the best way to do that is through full disclosure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd there was a time back when I was covering Congress that that was the mantra of a lot of folks, conservatives in particular, and Republicans, that disclosure was the answer rather than any kind of campaign finance reform restrictions like McCain-Feingold.\xc2\xa0 But the disclosure was what we should be pursuing.\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what this President has been pursuing and hopes that Congress will pass a full disclosure law.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator John Kerry says he\xe2\x80\x99ll be going to Pakistan in coming days to try to get relations back on the right track.\xc2\xa0 Will he be carrying any message from President Obama in the aftermath of Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s killing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nothing specifically.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we work very closely with Senator Kerry, but as the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he\xe2\x80\x99s also independent of us.\xc2\xa0 And we encourage the trip he\xe2\x80\x99s making.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s important and part of the overall efforts by the United States government to continue our collaborative relationship with Pakistan and the cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past; that while we don\xe2\x80\x99t always see eye-to-eye on the issues, that cooperation has led to some very important successes in our war against al Qaeda.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we are working at the administration level to continue our consultations with Pakistani leaders, to continue that kind of cooperation, and are glad to see Senator Kerry make that trip as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And former Pakistani President Musharraf is saying that rogue members of the military may have helped bin Laden hide for years near Islamabad.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration harbor any similar suspicions that they may be the culprits in this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that report, but I would just point you to the statements we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in the past, that National Security Advisor Tom Donilon made, which is that at the moment we see no indications of high-level government support or being part of the network of support that helped Osama bin Laden hide in Abbottabad.\xc2\xa0 But we obviously are investigating and have quite a bit of material that was collected from the compound to help guide us in that investigation.\xc2\xa0 The Pakistani government is also investigating this issue.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response to General Musharraf\xe2\x80\x99s comments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the end of the \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d interview, President Obama seemed to suggest that the successful mission against bin Laden could have ramifications for the war going forward.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, he seemed to suggest that we could have a smaller footprint because of the effectiveness of these smaller, highly-trained teams.\xc2\xa0 And he also said that he thought that this might quicken the pace of reconciliation.\xc2\xa0 How -- was he just speaking off the top of his head in terms of things that might be?\xc2\xa0 Or is there a direct correlation between the strategy we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see put forward in June-July and the successful mission?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me take this in two parts here.\xc2\xa0 The comments that he and others have made about the potential for reconciliation I think follow from the hope that the fact that the head of al Qaeda has been eliminated, that that might encourage some Taliban members to view their situation differently in terms of the reconciliation efforts led by President Karzai.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously informed speculation.\xc2\xa0 But it is not -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- that it could happen, that this advance in the fight against al Qaeda could have that kind of impact in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 It would certainly be welcome if it did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other part, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the President suggesting that -- a relation particularly to our footprint, if you mean in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The President has a policy in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 It very explicitly contains within it a transition point in July of 2011, where we begin to draw down U.S. forces.\xc2\xa0 The pace of that drawdown, the scope of that drawdown, depends on conditions on the ground.\xc2\xa0 And the President has yet to receive a recommendation for the first -- the number for the first movement of troops out in that drawdown.\xc2\xa0 So I think --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He seemed to be suggesting that he, at the very least, or the country could feel more confident that we would still be able to engage in counterterrorism even with a smaller-sized force in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the exact quote with me, but it was a direct correlation.\xc2\xa0 It was, this could tell us X.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t remember the quote you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to, but I think the counterterrorism efforts, the kind of effectiveness that we saw in the raid that eliminated bin Laden has been replicated in a lot of actions by our remarkable special operators in other areas in Afghanistan in particular.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think that as part of the package that the President put together when he very deliberately devised his strategy for Afghanistan and the AfPak region was -- and remember there was a big debate about, is it COIN?\xc2\xa0 Is it CT?\xc2\xa0 And it was never one or the other; it was a very thought-out approach that involved both elements, both strategies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but some people argue -- proponents of COIN argue that CT is most effective when counterinsurgency is working the best, because then there is this comfort level for intelligence and information to be shared, and CT can only be most effective with COIN.\xc2\xa0 And the President seemed to be suggesting a different point of view perhaps, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, first of all -- I guess --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t remember that he suggested that.\xc2\xa0 I think that his approach has been to contain -- have elements of both within it, and that\'s the approach he\xe2\x80\x99s taken in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 He believes that that has shown progress in a very difficult situation in Afghanistan overall.\xc2\xa0 But progress has been made and continues to be made, and the strategy we believe is making progress and working.\xc2\xa0 And then one evidence of its success has been the effectiveness of our efforts to go after and either capture or kill leading terrorists.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did any information for this mission come from COIN efforts?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into intelligence information and what might have been gathered, the, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, the mosaic of intelligence that led to the successful mission against bin Laden.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 A few minutes ago you were talking about finding common ground on deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense in these early talks what the temperature is like?\xc2\xa0 Does it appear that there could be some movement here, or are all sides digging in?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the Vice President feels, as the leader of these discussions, that there has been a constructive, positive atmosphere.\xc2\xa0 I note some reports out of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting that suggest that because a deal hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been reached, that they\xe2\x80\x99re somehow stalling.\xc2\xa0 And I just -- I think that these kinds of negotiations aren\xe2\x80\x99t resolved immediately.\xc2\xa0 These are tough issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Vice President reported optimism that we can find common ground.\xc2\xa0 The President believes very strongly that that\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xc2\xa0 He believes that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people want us to do, to try to reach a compromise that addresses the priorities that all sides agree exist, which is the need to reduce our deficit, the need to continue job creation, continue the kind of economic growth we\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing as we\xe2\x80\x99ve come out of this recession and, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, to do that in a way that protects the investments that will allow us to compete in the 21st century.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s any reaction to this letter written on behalf of bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s sons, where they talk about that the U.S. mission being \xe2\x80\x9ca criminal mission\xe2\x80\x9d and they take issue with the way that bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s body was disposed of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Dan, I\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed the legal foundation for the actions the President ordered.\xc2\xa0 We feel very strongly that the successful mission against a mass murderer of Americans and people around the world was entirely justified.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, one question on this address that the President is expected to make I guess at some point to the Arab world.\xc2\xa0 I know Secretary Clinton talked about this a number of weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us anything more on that, and in particular, a date?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I would say, Dan, is that the President will be giving an address in the relatively near future on the Middle East and U.S. policy in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a speech to a broader audience than just the Arab world.\xc2\xa0 And I think that characterization was more narrow than is actually the case.\xc2\xa0 So -- but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a date to announce for you at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could it be as early as next week -- without saying --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can just say that it will be relatively soon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Boehner and McConnell have redrawn even more deeply their lines in the sand over no taxes in any kind of a long-term deal.\xc2\xa0 Are they going to have to bend on that eventually?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past and I think remains true is that we obviously have big differences but we also have areas where we agree.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we address those areas where we agree and try to find common ground and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s a way to take a balanced approach towards those issues where we disagree.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we can\xe2\x80\x99t do, because I think it would be a disservice to the American people and to the people who elected the President and the members of Congress who are involved in this -- these negotiations, and the members who will vote on whatever the product that emerges from these negotiations is -- we can\xe2\x80\x99t simply say, well, this is too hard, our differences are too significant, we should just give up -- because that would be irresponsible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we believe that the talks have been productive and they can be productive.\xc2\xa0 Will we resolve all of our differences?\xc2\xa0 Probably not.\xc2\xa0 But will we find enough common ground to achieve significant deficit reduction?\xc2\xa0 The President believes we can.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really answer the question, though.\xc2\xa0 The question is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Really?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not.\xc2\xa0 The question is, can you imagine the President -- is it possible the President would eventually agree to a deal that has no new revenues at all?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President strongly believes that we need to address our long-term deficit and debt problem in a comprehensive, balanced way, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t place all the burden on a limited number of segments of our society -- senior citizens in need of health care, disabled citizens -- and in which everyone shares the burden -- shares the prosperity and shares the burden. That\xe2\x80\x99s his approach, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that he\xe2\x80\x99s coming to the table with in the form of the Vice President who is leading these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge the outcome.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I give up.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s move to another topic.\xc2\xa0 On NATO, the stepped-up attacks in Libya, what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s role in that?\xc2\xa0 There are U.S. drones at the very least involved in that. Has the President been involved in this decision to step up attacks in Libya?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are a member of the coalition; we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously a member of NATO --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But has the President been personally involved in that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It depends on what you mean by \xe2\x80\x9cpersonally involved.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s briefed regularly on it and in some detail, but he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously not -- the United States is not taking the lead in this mission, so he\xe2\x80\x99s not playing a lead role in that sense.\xc2\xa0 We believe that NATO is fully capable and is proving itself fully capable of fulfilling the mandate of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, and believe that, as we\'ve said in the past, if that mission is successfully accomplished in protecting civilians, enforcing an arms embargo, enforcing a no-fly zone, and the other measures that are being taken -- the non-military measures that have been taken by the United States and the international community continue to have an impact, that Muammar Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s days are numbered.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question:\xc2\xa0 Are you familiar with the FEMA -- the situation with FEMA, that they are now demanding that thousands of people, more than 5,000 people, who received FEMA awards due to floods in recent years are now being told that they have to give the money back because --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of that, Chip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you take that, any kind of comment --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll look into it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And FEMA is admitting it was their mistake, but they\xe2\x80\x99re demanding thousands of dollars back from people who don\'t have the money.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about that.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll take that question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I ask you about Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question on this draft order?\xc2\xa0 Recognizing that it is a draft and not complete, the Republican concern is that federal contracts could be awarded on the basis of political donations -- or not awarded because of political donations.\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting that in the writing of this order, when it becomes complete, that that concern would be taken from --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not trying to analyze the content of an executive order that has not been submitted in a final version.\xc2\xa0 I am saying, as I step back and look at this and try to explain the President\xe2\x80\x99s view over all on disclosure, that he thinks the principle of disclosure is important, and he certainly thinks -- we think that it would be entirely appropriate for federal taxpayers to know where those who receive federal contracts, how some of that money might be spent in terms of political contributions -- as a general principle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, this is a draft order, a draft executive order.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a timetable for when -- for the process that it\xe2\x80\x99s going through or anything specific about its language.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The OMB\xe2\x80\x99s Director of Procurement is going up to the Hill tomorrow to testify.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s our understanding, my understanding, that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be able to talk about this order because it\xe2\x80\x99s not final.\xc2\xa0 So how do you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- my understanding is -- I mean, why would he testify about a draft order that\'s a draft?\xc2\xa0 So I think he can, in his capacity of being in charge of procurement, obviously testify on that basis, on his area of responsibility.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I don\'t really have anything else I can add.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you then assure Republicans that such a disclosure would not be turned to political ends?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\'re trying to get me to explain or divulge information about an executive order that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been finalized.\xc2\xa0 And that process -- if and when that process is completed, I\'m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll be made aware of it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is the thinking you finalize it and if opponents have challenges they deal with it after?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a draft executive order, Wendell.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve stated the general principle.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything else to add to it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today the former speaker is throwing his hat in the presidential ring.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if the President has -- President Obama -- has thrown his -- or has expressed an opinion about why it\xe2\x80\x99s taking so long for Republicans to get into the race to run against him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not in my presence.\xc2\xa0 And I think he\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aside from his formidable record of accomplishments.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact is, because of my job and the travel, I\'ve spent a lot of time with the President since I\'ve taken this job, and I have not heard him discuss in private, even, that process.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have anything to add to it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 You have often said that there\xe2\x80\x99s no linkage between raising the debt ceiling and some sort of agreement with Republicans in Congress.\xc2\xa0 But it seems as though now with it being pushed back to August 2nd, according to the Treasury Secretary that accounts can be handled in such a way as the United States will not default on its obligations, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it seem more apparent now that there is a linkage between a debt plan and a vote in Congress?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me make two points.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I just want to be clear about the pushing back of the deadline.\xc2\xa0 It was not because of what the Treasury Department was able to do with accounts, because that was always the case as previous Treasury Departments have been able to do.\xc2\xa0 The reason it was pushed back a little bit was because of higher than expected revenues, which is the nature of these things.\xc2\xa0 And that estimate for when the drop-dead deadline will take place remains an estimate and could be adjusted up or back as more information comes in, more data comes in.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, what we have said, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty candid about this, is that both the need to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States of America does not default on its obligations is urgent; the need to deal with our long-term deficit and debt problems is also urgent.\xc2\xa0 We are pursuing -- one has to be done -- has to be done -- unless there\xe2\x80\x99s an outcome here that anyone in a position of power and responsibility could accept that involves catastrophic impacts on the domestic and global economy.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anyone say that that would be a good outcome.\xc2\xa0 So one has to be done.\xc2\xa0 We have to raise the debt ceiling, because the United States is the United States; it\xe2\x80\x99s the most important, powerful economy in the world.\xc2\xa0 The full faith and credit of the United States government is essentially our reputation in the world.\xc2\xa0 And to default on those obligations would be calamitous, would have calamitous consequences.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have said one should not be held hostage to the other.\xc2\xa0 We are pursuing both within the same timeframe.\xc2\xa0 We are pursuing essentially these agenda items on parallel tracks.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that we can reach an agreement on significant deficit reduction within the same timeframe that we need -- that Congress needs to take action to raise the debt ceiling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it simply would be folly, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, to say that if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get an agreement or if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get the agreement we want, then we\xe2\x80\x99re just not going to raise the debt ceiling come what may.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is we know what may come if that happens and it is not pretty.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, finally, the Federal Appeals Court has ruled, in the case of the Veterans Administration, treatment of veterans with emotional and mental problems -- sort of a really broadside against and an indictment against the treatment of these veterans with these kinds of challenges, calling it \xe2\x80\x9cunchecked incompetence.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I did see that and I will say, generally speaking, that the Veterans Administration and the Justice Department are taking a very hard look at that ruling and will work closely to address any of the issues raised by the court.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important also to step back and note that President Obama strongly believes that the country has a sacred bond with the men and women who have served in our military, and he has taken dramatic steps to improve the health care -- both physical and mental health -- for our veterans.\xc2\xa0 This has been one of his highest priorities -- both the President, the Vice President, the First Lady, Dr. Biden.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership there has been a dramatic increase in funding and support for veterans\xe2\x80\x99 health care.\xc2\xa0 The VA has seen one of the largest increases in its budget in over 30 years -- in the past 30 years, rather.\xc2\xa0 So this is an issue we take very seriously, and that\'s why the administration will look at this ruling and consider it closely.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Laura.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last night at his fundraiser, the President mentioned the mission to kill Osama bin Laden, and that was the first time he had really mentioned foreign policy at all in any of these -- sort of the stump speech he has developed.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not sure that\'s the case.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s mentioned --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quite a few he didn\'t.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t check every single one, but in any case, certainly the first time he mentioned Osama bin Laden -- for obvious reasons.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the first person to mention Osama bin Laden was a crowd member in the audience.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, but then it was obviously -- also seemed to be part of his text, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, it was --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\'s true.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if that\'s going to be part of his normal sort of speech that he delivers on the fundraising circuit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what the President said in his speech was that because of the incredible work, professionalism and commitment and courage of our military men and women, and in particular, those who participated in the mission, and because of the extraordinary work of our intelligence community, we were able to eliminate Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 That happened nine or 10 days ago; certainly prominent on people\xe2\x80\x99s mind, as was evidenced by the -- what a gentleman in the crowd said much earlier in the speech.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I can\xe2\x80\x99t predict to you what will be in the content of the President\xe2\x80\x99s speeches going forward, but I certainly think what he said last night was entirely appropriate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the successful mission among the reasons why the President deserves reelection?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the successful mission is a good thing unequivocally -- for America, for the families and loved ones who lost someone on 9/11, for the world in a fight against a scourge. And the President believes that good policy is why he came -- good policy is good politics.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s here; that\xe2\x80\x99s why he wanted to be President; that\xe2\x80\x99s why he ran.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s like saying, is the fight for health care reform or the fight to lift our economy out of the deepest recession since the Great Depression -- are those elements of his campaign platform?\xc2\xa0 The answer is his record is his record.\xc2\xa0 And obviously he will be running on his record and he will be running on his vision of where this country needs to go and where he thinks -- where he would like to take it in the four years after the end of his first term.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you know if there was discussion in advance on whether he would raise the bin Laden killing in his --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I did not hear any.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue which he thinks he should get political points?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Mark, let\xe2\x80\x99s make clear what the President said.\xc2\xa0 He said -- and this was after someone in the audience commented on the successful mission against bin Laden --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- he said that because of the remarkable work of our armed forces and our intelligence community, we were able to bring Osama bin Laden to justice after a nine-and-a-half year -- or actually much longer hunt.\xc2\xa0 So again, going back to Laura\xe2\x80\x99s question, I don\'t -- fortunately, having gotten out of the business of writing for a living, I\xe2\x80\x99m not writing his speeches, and I don\'t anticipate -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t predict what will be in his speeches going forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Mideast speech, would it be after the meetings with Netanyahu and King Abdullah?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t have a date to give you now, but I expect it will be fairly soon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that the deadline for the debt ceiling has been moved to August 2nd, given Congress\xe2\x80\x99s record, how concerned are you that the decisions won\xe2\x80\x99t be made until the night of August 1st?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point you to comments from Secretary Geithner, because there is a risk here that looking at that deadline as the moment to act would create negative consequences, even if action were taken before the deadline.\xc2\xa0 Because if the markets -- as I understand it -- anticipate the possibility -- the unthinkable possibility -- that the United States would somehow not meet its obligations, would default, then we expect, or the experts expect that there would be a reaction, a negative reaction -- a negative reaction for the United States\xe2\x80\x99 economy, a negative reaction for growth and job creation, a negative reaction around the globe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\'s why we have urged from the beginning, regardless of the slight shifts in the deadline because of some of the issues I mentioned before, that we need to take -- that Congress needs to take action sooner rather than later, because you don\'t want a situation where, as we approach a deadline, there is any doubt in the markets, the global economy that this is going to get done.\xc2\xa0 Because it will get done -- as every leader in Congress has said, and as the President, the Vice President and others have said -- it will get done because it has to get done, because we are the United States of America and we don\'t default on our obligations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But giving them that very late --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not -- look, the Secretary of Treasury has an obligation to report on this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not giving him -- or giving, rather, the Congress data.\xc2\xa0 This is what he, as the Secretary of Treasury, is obligated to provide, is information about when we reach our debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- the deadline was pushed back a little bit because revenues were higher than expected -- generally a good thing, probably because of economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 But this is not by much, and the fact is the deadline -- the clock is ticking and we need to take action.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Boeing CEO Jim McNerney, who chairs the President\xe2\x80\x99s Export Council, said the National Labor Relations Board suit against his company for building a plant in a right-to-work state is a fundamental assault on capitalism.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering is the President aware of the issue, and does he think the government should be involved in how businesses allocate capital or resources?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously been in the news, so we are aware of it, but I would refer any questions about it to the NLRB because it is an independent agency, and we do not get involved in particular enforcement matters of independent agencies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has weighed in on outside issues before, though.\xc2\xa0 I mean is this something -- it\xe2\x80\x99s also coming from someone who is chairing the Export Council, who\xe2\x80\x99s saying this is hurting job creation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a reaction to this from the President.\xc2\xa0 And I think the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s weighed in on outside issues doesn\'t mean that he will weigh in on an independent agency\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement action.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the broader point about capitalism and our support for it, I just want to remind you that yesterday General Motors announced that it would hire 4,200 workers at 17 of its plants around the country.\xc2\xa0 It announced a $2 billion investment.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is an industry that was on its back when the President took office, and he made a very unpopular decision to do what he thought was the right thing, which was to save the American auto industry, and to do it in a way -- to put taxpayer money on the line to save that industry, but to make sure that in taking that action, that the companies involved would restructure themselves in a way that would make them what they have become, which is profitable, successful leaders in the automotive industry.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think another thing I would point out is that -- very encouraging news -- there was from the American Enterprise Institute, a blog post by Mark J. Perry, professor of economics and finance in the School of Management at the Flint Campus of the University of Michigan, in which he describes:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThe impressive rebound in U.S. manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 That rebound is shown by 7 percent growth in manufacturing in 2010, and 9 percent in the first quarter of 2011, as well as the fact that more manufacturing jobs were created in the first four months of this year than in any year since 1984.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a very positive sign for our economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just finally, does the U.S. have any evidence that Qaddafi is alive or where he is?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment on what intelligence we may or may not have.\xc2\xa0 We obviously are participants in the NATO mission, as I mentioned earlier, and continue the efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99ve undertaken to put pressure on Qaddafi and his regime because he needs to leave power.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question about immigration.\xc2\xa0 Now that he\xe2\x80\x99s made it pretty clear who\xe2\x80\x99s stopping immigration reform from going forward -- Republicans switched on the DREAM Act, they\xe2\x80\x99re moving the goalposts on comprehensive reform -- what plans does the President have to find Republican partners to pass the bill he now --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean in Congress, not --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I get it, but Congress responds to and is elected by constituents, American people.\xc2\xa0 And they have -- they hear from small business owners, large business owners, corporations, non-profit organizations, citizens in their communities and districts and states.\xc2\xa0 And part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s effort here is to try to build support for comprehensive immigration reform from the outside in, instead of walking up to the Hill and saying, let\xe2\x80\x99s get this done, because\xc2\xa0 -- as a first step -- because obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s a hard approach right now, and so he\xe2\x80\x99s taking a different approach because he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to find the right road in here to get this very important issue done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When does he expect to take the second step?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he just gave a major speech on this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The other day I was asked about, well, how could he be serious about it since it\xe2\x80\x99s so politically hard?\xc2\xa0 And I made the point that the most valuable commodity, the coin of the realm in the White House is presidential time, and he\xe2\x80\x99s committed a lot of time to it lately.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to commit a lot of time to it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a scheduling announcement for you.\xc2\xa0 But he clearly, based on what you heard and saw yesterday and the meetings he\xe2\x80\x99s had here, remains committed to comprehensive immigration reform.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it seems like the measure of his seriousness, in addition to his time, is going to be sitting down with some Republicans who could actually work out something that could pass.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering is that what he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Congress does have to pass legislation, no question.\xc2\xa0 And there will be a point in this process where the legislative piece is pushed forward.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give you\xc2\xa0 -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to lay out our strategy for how to get this done from here.\xc2\xa0 But I assure you that the commitment, as evidenced by the use of this valuable commodity, the President\xe2\x80\x99s time, and by the words that he speaks on the issue and the meetings that he has, he is committed to it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question about it.\xc2\xa0 He seemed to suggest in the speech that even though he wants all the people there to put pressure on Congress for comprehensive reform, but also he said to find things we could do right now.\xc2\xa0 And he mentioned the DREAM Act, and he also mentioned visa reform.\xc2\xa0 Would he be willing to break off little chunks of comprehensive reform like H1BI visa and do that separately?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he would be very willing to sign the DREAM Act into law tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, that I understand.\xc2\xa0 But he mentioned visa reform, which suggested that maybe he saw that as a separate standalone --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go beyond what the President said.\xc2\xa0 And, obviously, he did mention the possibility of doing those things we could do now, because this is a hard issue and it takes the kind of coalition building that he talked about and the kind of bipartisan effort that is required for anything hard.\xc2\xa0 And he would be pleased with smaller steps if they can be taken and accomplished.\xc2\xa0 And the DREAM Act -- it was a terrible disappointment to him and, obviously, to a lot of people, that the DREAM Act, which passed the House and which won a majority in the Senate, was not able to become law late last year.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And visa reform was the same -- one of those smaller steps?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I would just point you to what the President said.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jackie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On scheduling, is there anything imminent in terms of the President visiting the areas that have been flooded?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a scheduling update for you on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he likely to go visit anytime soon?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say likely or unlikely because I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement to make about presidential trips.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the debt limit, for all the talk of doing what Congress and the President did on the current fiscal year appropriation short-term extensions, what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s attitude towards short-term extensions of the debt limit?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to Tim Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s statements on that.\xc2\xa0 I believe he has addressed that.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t add to it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some questions for you, a series of questions where DOMA and immigration intersect.\xc2\xa0 Under DOMA, U.S. citizens in legally recognized same-sex marriages cannot sponsor their spouses for residency in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And -- nationals could be subject to deportation and separation from their spouses upon expiration of temporary visas. Members of Congress have been calling on President Obama to issue a temporary moratorium on these deportations.\xc2\xa0 Is there any consideration in the administration to issuing such an order? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President I think made the point in his speech yesterday that he believes we have to take comprehensive action on immigration reform and that he can\xe2\x80\x99t just wave a wand and change the law.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that, in terms of his views.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you believe that issuing such an order is within the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not for me to decide.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the legislative side -- on the legislative side, does the President want to see a fix to this problem, whether these nationals are married to their same-sex partners or otherwise, as part of comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s legislation that would accomplish this end known as the Uniting American Families Act.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a level of specificity I don\xe2\x80\x99t have.\xc2\xa0 But the President is committed to comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 He thinks that it\xe2\x80\x99s got to contain the elements of the continued focus on law enforcement and border control.\xc2\xa0 And it has to deal with changes to legal immigration and a way to deal with the 11 million illegal immigrants here that\xe2\x80\x99s fair to both them and to businesses and to those who are here legally and approaching this in a legal manner.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President address this specific address during his immigration speech yesterday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He gave a pretty long, comprehensive speech, Chris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 And I know April has a question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So both Pakistan and the U.S. intelligence community are looking into whether and what there was in terms of any official Pakistani complicity in harboring --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99re looking into what support network there was, official or otherwise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my question is, are you committing to giving the American people that information if any such evidence is found?\xc2\xa0 And if any such evidence is uncovered, how might it affect U.S. policy toward Pakistan?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re throwing out a lot of hypotheticals.\xc2\xa0 Let me say that obviously we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to keep the American people informed on these and other important matters; it is also important that matters of intelligence are not things that we can discuss publicly or in particular from this podium.\xc2\xa0 So the broader --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean you might --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to address a hypothetical because you\xe2\x80\x99re presupposing an outcome to these investigations that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just say more broadly that we understand the concern that\xe2\x80\x99s out there about the fact that Osama bin Laden was able to find refuge in Abbottabad for as long as he did.\xc2\xa0 We obviously share that concern.\xc2\xa0 We have to focus additionally on the fact that Pakistan has been a vital partner in the fight against al Qaeda, and terrorists and terrorism more broadly.\xc2\xa0 And that cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved with Pakistan, despite the differences that we have and the problems the relationship sometimes encounters, that cooperation has been extremely helpful in the effort to capture or kill the most ruthless terrorists in the world.\xc2\xa0 And again, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said and others have said, more of those terrorists have been captured and killed because of cooperation with Pakistan on Pakistani soil than anywhere else.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could sum up what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, just to make sure I understand, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you might share the evidence with the American people unless it\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence information that can\xe2\x80\x99t be shared, and it might --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we won\xe2\x80\x99t share classified intelligence information.\xc2\xa0 But again, that\xe2\x80\x99s unrelated to your question.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re presupposing an outcome to an investigation of which there is no outcome at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then just to sum up the second part, what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is, depending on what\xe2\x80\x99s discovered, it might or might not affect the U.S. relationship with Pakistan?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re posing a hypothetical, and what I will say about the relationship with Pakistan is that -- well, two things.\xc2\xa0 One, I\xe2\x80\x99ll point you to what Tom Donilon said on Sunday about what we know so far and what we don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 And two, nobody is pretending that this is not a complicated relationship where there are times when we don\xe2\x80\x99t see eye-to-eye or we disagree.\xc2\xa0 But it remains very much in the interests of the American people that we maintain a cooperative relationship with Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 It is vital to our national security interest and to the effort -- the war that we have been waging against al Qaeda now for so many years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to April.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, what is the agenda tomorrow for the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus?\xc2\xa0 You had somewhat of a general overview, but what is the dynamic of that meeting tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more to add to what I said I guess it was yesterday or the other day.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it\xe2\x80\x99s any more specific than the agenda -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda with Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any conversations on the jobs issue, particularly --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that jobs and the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the African American unemployment numbers and what not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Jobs and the economy are --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Black teens, 44 percent unemployment rate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That might be the case -- it might be part of the dialogue.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an agenda for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And also, I just got off the phone with singer, poet, philanthropist Jill Scott who\xe2\x80\x99s performing tonight for the poetry and prose.\xc2\xa0 And she said she\xe2\x80\x99s very disappointed to hear about the critics of Common -- Sarah Palin and some of the GOP to include people in the New Jersey State Police -- about his stand and his comments.\xc2\xa0 What does this White House have to say as Common is an invited guest to be able to deliver his poetry and prose to the group that\xe2\x80\x99s coming tonight?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a couple of points about that, April.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the President does not support and opposes the kinds of lyrics that have been written about, as he has in the past.\xc2\xa0 He has spoken very forcefully out against violent and misogynist lyrics.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, in regard to the concerns by some law enforcement, this President\xe2\x80\x99s record of support for law enforcement is extremely strong.\xc2\xa0 He remains committed to the men and women who protect the American citizens and put themselves in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way all the time.\xc2\xa0 He was able to express that appreciation and support just last week in New York when he met with police and firefighters.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I would say that while the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support the kind of lyrics that have been raised here, he does -- I mean, we do think that some of these reports distort what Mr. Lynn stands for, more broadly, in order to stoke a controversy.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he is -- within the genre of hip-hop and rap, he is what\xe2\x80\x99s known as a conscience rapper -- or a conscious rapper, rather.\xc2\xa0 And I would quote a report just six months ago from Fox News where he was described as a rap legend and quote, \xe2\x80\x9cYour music is very positive and you\xe2\x80\x99re known as the conscious rapper.\xc2\xa0 How important is that to you, and how important do you think that is to our kids?\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think that one of the things that the President appreciates is the work that Mr. Lynn has done with children, especially in Chicago, trying to get them to focus on poetry, as opposed to some of the negative influences of life on the street.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, \xe2\x80\x9cconscious\xe2\x80\x9d was the word you used?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Conscious.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Conscious?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Conscious, yes.\xc2\xa0 Conscious rapper -- as in socially conscious.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So going back to my conversation with Jill Scott just literally a few minutes ago, she said it\xe2\x80\x99s about freedoms and it\xe2\x80\x99s about creativity, and it\xe2\x80\x99s his thoughts, his opinions.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s supporting his thought.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then -- but wait a minute.\xc2\xa0 But also, at the same time, did this White House vet any of the poetry that the poets are delivering tonight before they deliver them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know specifically about the vetting process.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, Mr. Lynn has participated in other events in the past, including the lighting of the Christmas Tree, I believe.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s a Grammy award-winning -- multi Grammy-award winning artist.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s been invited to this event about poetry, and partly because of his efforts to bring poetry to audiences that don\xe2\x80\x99t get to experience it.\xc2\xa0 And we think that\xe2\x80\x99s a positive thing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?\xc2\xa0 I mean what --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you must.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, somewhat must.\xc2\xa0 I mean, why would it that someone who has made statements threatening to kill police officers get invited to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Keith, let me just make clear that we oppose --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is it an appropriate thing for him to be here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has spoken out about -- very strongly against -- as an elected official, as an American and as a father, against those kinds of lyrics.\xc2\xa0 And he opposes them.\xc2\xa0 But he does not think that that is the sum total of this particular artist\xe2\x80\x99s work, which has been recognized by a lot of mainstream organizations and fair and balanced organizations like Fox News, which described his music as very positive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you sarcastic when you say that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but I mean, is it then possible that whatever your overriding message -- that killing cops is a very serious matter -- you can basically say anything as long as your overriding message is positive and get invited to the White House?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed this.\xc2\xa0 We -- the President opposes those kinds of lyrics.\xc2\xa0 He thinks they\xe2\x80\x99re harmful.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that taking that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s ironic to pick out those particular lyrics about this particular artist, when in fact, he\xe2\x80\x99s known as a socially conscious hip-hop artist or rapper who has done a lot of good things.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not -- you can oppose some of what he\xe2\x80\x99s done and appreciate some of the other things he\xe2\x80\x99s done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there concern he\xe2\x80\x99ll get associated with that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s all I can say on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- as racist?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On Syria, Jay, does the administration has a response to the shellings that are -- that took place today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, we strongly condemn and oppose the violence in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work unilaterally and collectively with our allies to urge the government of Syria to cease the violence, to engage in political dialogue.\xc2\xa0 Because stability will not come -- I mean, there are a lot of reasons.\xc2\xa0 One, it\xe2\x80\x99s abhorrent to use violence in any form against peaceful protestors and against unarmed citizens, your own citizens.\xc2\xa0 But, two, if what they seek is stability, they are sowing the seeds of more instability by doing what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing, and we strongly condemn that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you understand how maybe the people of Syria, like the actual citizenry that\xe2\x80\x99s being targeted by the Assad administration, feels like they\xe2\x80\x99re being left out or they\xe2\x80\x99re being overlooked?\xc2\xa0 Because, I mean, the U.S. --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the U.S. and NATO has been increasing pressures against the Qaddafi regime.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been increasing pressure against Syria as well, with the sanction we\xe2\x80\x99ve announced --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s never been a call for Assad to step down.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s never been any statement saying he\xe2\x80\x99s not a legitimate leader anymore.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will say on that issue, again, with the comparisons to Syria, it is important to remember that each country in this region that has experienced upheaval is different in many ways.\xc2\xa0 And the situation with Libya was quite distinct and unique in terms of the state of the country at the time that the United Nations and NATO took action, the imminence of a brutal assault on a city of 750,000 people -- people who were basically -- had a sword over their necks, being held by the leader of the Libyan regime, Muammar Qaddafi, who promised to show no mercy to those citizens of that city.\xc2\xa0 And there was a capacity that the U.N. resolution enabled for NATO to protect those civilians, enforce a no-fly zone and an arms embargo that would achieve those tailored military goals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs for Syria, we, again, strongly condemn the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s use of violence.\xc2\xa0 It has been made abundantly clear to the Syrian government that its security crackdown will not restore stability and will not stop the demands for change in Syria.\xc2\xa0 The Syrian government continues to follow the lead of its Iranian ally in resorting to brute force and flagrant violations of human rights and suppressing peaceful protest.\xc2\xa0 And history is not on the side of this kind of action.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you continue to believe that Assad is the type of leader that can usher in --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to -- as it is in all these countries, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the people of the region to decide who its leader should be.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that the government ought to listen to its people, refrain from violence, and engage in political dialogue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThank you, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:12 P.M.
