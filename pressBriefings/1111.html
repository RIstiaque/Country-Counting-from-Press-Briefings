EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make at the top, so I will start with the Associated Press.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Erica.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 So on Thursday, after the last debt talk meeting that you all announced, that happened here, the President had asked the members to report back within 24 to 36 hours on what could pass.\xc2\xa0 Did that happen?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, the Vice President, senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s team have been in conversations ever since Thursday with leaders and relevant staff.\xc2\xa0 And so, yes, the conversations, communications have been ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And in that sense, yes, they reported back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there are obviously a lot of discussions about the fact that the President continues to insist that we should push for the biggest possible deficit reduction package, that a unique opportunity is presenting itself here for the United States to do something historic -- working together, Democrats and Republicans -- to significantly reduce our deficit, get our debt under control, and position ourselves for a competition -- an economic competition globally that will be quite stiff.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he continues to push for the biggest possible deal, if you will, mindful of the fact that we are now less than two weeks away from the deadline regarding the need to raise the debt ceiling and so, also, obviously having these conversations to make sure that there was a backup measure, a failsafe measure which, as you know, Senator McConnell has been working on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there anything new that would lead you to believe that a big package still could happen?\xc2\xa0 Anything in the meeting with Boehner and Cantor that makes you think that could pass the House?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 While I have no specific announcement or progress report to give you, I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s always been difficult, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen throughout this process, to convince everybody at the table that they need to put their partisan politics aside, they need to get outside of their comfort zone in order to reach for this prize, which is a bipartisan, significant deficit reduction package that does it in a balanced way so that no sector of society is unfairly asked to bear the sacrifice.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess I would say that this is never -- was never going to be easy.\xc2\xa0 It certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look easy today.\xc2\xa0 But the President still believes that we should push for the biggest possible deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, can you tell us about the Boehner-Cantor meeting, and also why not announce this one when others have been?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, actually, first of all, I would just say that there have been, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, conversations ongoing since Thursday -- the President, the Vice President, senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s team, with leaders of Congress in both parties.\xc2\xa0 Those conversations continued yesterday and today, and will continue until this deal is done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific readout to give you of a specific conversation or meeting.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t given specific -- readouts to specific meetings or conversations in the past.\xc2\xa0 Some of them have been reported on after the fact, and we\'ve acknowledged them.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is, that we -- there are too many conversations and meetings taking place for us to catalogue each and every one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why was this meeting then not on the schedule, as compared to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are meetings and conversations that the President and the Vice President and other senior members of their team have all the time that aren\xe2\x80\x99t on the schedule.\xc2\xa0 This is an ongoing, fluid process that involves the set piece meetings the President had last week with the eight leaders of Congress, both houses, as well as ongoing conversations at different levels with different participants.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, on the meeting that the President had with House Speak Boehner and Cantor as well yesterday, can you be specific about the kind of progress that was made?\xc2\xa0 The President did say as he left the podium that progress was made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the President was referring to overall, since Thursday -- since Friday when you last saw him, since the last meeting on Thursday, that progress has been made.\xc2\xa0 And I would say that there are a variety of paths we can travel down here.\xc2\xa0 The President is pushing for the biggest deal possible; continues to believe that there\'s an opportunity here to achieve that if only all sides were willing to compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is the possibility for something short of the biggest deal possible but still something significant that would provide some deficit reduction -- some significant deficit reduction, but would also still require balance, would still require give on the part of Republicans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Short of that, because every leader at the table, every responsible leader on Capitol Hill, agrees with the President that we cannot let the United States default on its obligations for the first time in its history, we must pursue a fallback or last-ditch option, if you will.\xc2\xa0 And that is -- conversations about that have been ongoing.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Senator McConnell has taken the lead in that to a measure that would allow the debt ceiling to be raised.\xc2\xa0 And that continues -- those conversations continue, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President and the Republican leaders discuss -- specifically discuss McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s backup plan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, without getting into readout of a specific conversation, you can be sure that in all of these encounters and conversations that the President, the Vice President, Jack Lew, Tim Geithner, Gene Sperling -- all the participants -- Bruce Reed -- have been having, that the variety of options are being discussed, because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the luxury anymore of pursuing one only; we have to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing -- we have to make sure that there is a mechanism in place to be sure that no matter what happens, the United States does not default.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will the President meet with them, those two, today, tomorrow, the next day?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no scheduling announcements to make, but I can tell you that he is continuing to have those consultations with Democratic leaders, Republican leaders, and his -- the Vice President and others are as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will Democrats in the House vote for the McConnell-Reid measure enough to pass, just in case it comes down to the wire in here?\xc2\xa0 Because it seems as though everybody is off on their different track here.\xc2\xa0 The House Republicans are passing cap, cut, and balance, which probably can\xe2\x80\x99t pass the Senate, and if it does, the President has said today he will veto.\xc2\xa0 So McConnell is doing his thing.\xc2\xa0 Are you guys trying to at least lobby Democrats to vote for this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, these conversations are ongoing about precisely that.\xc2\xa0 We need to make sure that whatever we do here can pass Congress and is acceptable to the President to sign.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have too much time to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I can\'t answer your question because we don\'t actually know what that bill would look like yet and I think that the same question could be asked of House Republicans about whether -- because they have registered the loudest protests, I believe, to Senator McConnell\'s proposal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think the leaders are working on that, looking at various ways that we can, even through that mechanism, get significant deficit reduction or at least some deficit reduction. But that is a fluid process and to predict what might get votes and from where is hard to do when we don\'t even know exactly what the measure will be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the consumer financial protection board, Senate Republicans sent a letter to the President in May saying that they would block any nominee unless changes were made to the board, replacing the director with an advisory panel, making the board -- the bureau would have to seek congressional appropriations and another change that escapes me.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have a response to them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President strongly believes that the board, as it is constructed, is the right thing for the American people. I mean, it has not been that long since the financial crisis led to the deepest recession since the Great Depression, and that millions of Americans are still feeling the effects of that.\xc2\xa0 And so many Americans get their credit card agreements and don\'t understand the fine print that\'s written in a way precisely so that they cannot understand it, and then find out that their rates double overnight.\xc2\xa0 So many Americans -- I know when I closed a mortgage on my house, there\'s so much paperwork, how could you possibly understand what\'s in it?\xc2\xa0 \\<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this bureau is designed precisely to protect consumers and it is an essential thing to do.\xc2\xa0 If there is anything we learned out of this crisis it was that consumers need to be protected.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes very strongly that the CFPB is vital to that.\xc2\xa0 And Elizabeth Warren has done an excellent job in standing up that bureau, and Richard Cordray will do an excellent job leading it into the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Public Citizen said about the fact that Warren was not nominated to the position, "Wall Street and the big banks did not want her to get the job.\xc2\xa0 President Barack Obama decided to succumb to those interests rather than fight for the American people."\xc2\xa0 Do you have a response?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the President established this bureau and it was Elizabeth Warren\'s idea.\xc2\xa0 The President asked Elizabeth Warren to stand up this agency and she did an excellent job.\xc2\xa0 I need not remind you what Republicans in the Senate have said about the possibility of a confirmation for Elizabeth Warren and their absolute refusal for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What the -- the obstacles here are clear.\xc2\xa0 And as you noted, the obstacles are blanket, at least according to Republican senators.\xc2\xa0 They do not want this agency that is designed precisely to protect consumers to exist as it now stands, and they\'ve said they would reject or oppose any nominee, which is something I think that needs to be explained to the American people because this agency is there to protect them. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we will continue -- we believe that Richard Cordray is the right person.\xc2\xa0 The President firmly believes he\'s the right person.\xc2\xa0 His record as chief of enforcement is exemplary.\xc2\xa0 His record in Ohio is very impressive.\xc2\xa0 So he\'s the right person for the job and we believe the Senate should, and will, confirm him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the point that Public Citizen was making was that the President should have fought for Elizabeth Warren, instead of blinking. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think our position is clear:\xc2\xa0 Richard Cordray is the right person for the job, and we are going to fight to get him confirmed.\xc2\xa0 And I think that if you look at his record he is absolutely the same kind of defender of consumers in the financial world as Elizabeth Warren has been in her service.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to bounce off of that, so did the White House conclude that there was no way that Elizabeth Warren could have been confirmed?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I mean, I would let Elizabeth Warren\xe2\x80\x99s words speak for themselves about the opposition to her. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point.\xc2\xa0 The White House concluded, the President concluded that Richard Cordray was the right person for the job going forward.\xc2\xa0 His record at the CFPB is exemplary; his record in Ohio is well known to those in the field for its success.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s the right person going forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s appreciation for Elizabeth Warren is enormous.\xc2\xa0 Again, this was her idea.\xc2\xa0 The agency is the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that this was a fundamental aspect of the Dodd-Frank bill, and he will continue to fight to make sure that it is stood up and this bureau is there protecting consumers going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But had there not been that stiff opposition, would she have been the person nominated?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hypotheticals are hard to answer.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is the President appreciates what Elizabeth Warren has done.\xc2\xa0 As an observation of fact, the kind of opposition she engendered is clear.\xc2\xa0 As another observation of fact, some Republican senators have a blanket opposition to the agency as it is, which I think, again, is worth noting to Americans out there that this agency, which exists principally and -- well, entirely to defend their interests against -- in helping them be better prepared in dealing with banks and financial institutions, is not supported by Republicans in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 So the President\xe2\x80\x99s focused on moving this forward, and he thinks Richard Cordray is the absolute right person to do the job.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In these debt/deficit talks, is everyone on the same page when it comes to not wanting this August 2nd deadline to come and go and not having a deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Everyone in the leadership is.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there are some members of Congress who have blithely stated that this is not a serious deadline, and we could not disagree more.\xc2\xa0 And there are just so many other voices of authority out there in the field who I could point you to who also make clear that the August 2nd deadline is serious, the consequences of default would be catastrophic.\xc2\xa0 It would essentially be an instant tax on every American in the country.\xc2\xa0 Anyone who pays a credit card bill, anyone who pays a mortgage, anyone who deals with interest rates at all would immediately feel the effects.\xc2\xa0 And then, of course, the long-term or even mid-term effects on the economy would be significant on growth and on job creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President remains confident that action will be taken, that the debt ceiling will be raised, that the United States will not default on its obligations.\xc2\xa0 He takes the leaders of Congress of both parties at their word when they say that we will not default, Congress will raise the debt ceiling, will take measures so that the debt ceiling is raised.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re proceeding accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the leadership in these meetings, they\xe2\x80\x99re on the same page when it comes to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Unanimous. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They will get something done --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- it\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of whether it will be this big deal, some middle-range deal, or a smaller deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 And I think that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about is that the Senator -- the provision that was put forward by Senator McConnell was essentially an acknowledgment of the fact that the coupling of the two ideas -- that a package for significant deficit reduction that was linked originally by Republicans to a vote to raise the debt ceiling had to be delinked. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because no matter what happens -- we continue to push for the biggest possible deficit-reduction package.\xc2\xa0 We continue to think that\xe2\x80\x99s the best outcome of this.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to think there is time to achieve that -- because everyone knows what\xe2\x80\x99s on the table.\xc2\xa0 Contrary to what some people say for public consumption, it is clear to every leader in that room who has participated in these negotiations -- clear to every Republican in that room what the President is willing to do if there is a partner to do it with, in terms of compromise and achieving significant deficit reduction. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That remains possible.\xc2\xa0 However, we have to ensure that there is a fallback provision, that there is a measure through which Congress will act and we can ensure that the United States will not default.\xc2\xa0 And the leaders in that room are unanimously in support of doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Americans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be concerned?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Americans should not be concerned.\xc2\xa0 We believe the debt ceiling will be raised; the United States will not default.\xc2\xa0 We obviously are in a relatively short period of time here, so the fact that we remain confident that that will happen is, I think, important, but it does not mean we can let up.\xc2\xa0 We have to continue and press forward with our work to ensure that it does happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Norah, welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Was Sunday the first time that the President has met privately with Boehner and Cantor?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give readouts of meetings or conversations individually.\xc2\xa0 I can say that the President, Vice President, senior members of their team have been in ongoing conversations with congressional leaders, senior relevant staff members on the Hill, trying to move this process forward, to make sure that we, at the very least, do what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to ensure the United States does not default, and hopefully do much more than that, which is to achieve significant deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 The President has had numerous meetings with all the leaders of Congress over these past many weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you expect that there will be more of these smaller type meetings with the leadership that are not on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate what kinds of meetings or their makeup might be, or conversations, except that the conversations will continue.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling announcements to make, but it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a pretty fluid situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President had said over a week ago that they were going to meet every day until a deal is done.\xc2\xa0 So does that still hold true?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, describing these as conversations -- whether they\xe2\x80\x99re meetings or phone calls or -- and depending on who\xe2\x80\x99s involved in them, yes, there are meetings and conversations every day.\xc2\xa0 And there will be every day until this is done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that, again, when I say there will be meetings, I\xe2\x80\x99m not describing who will be participants in them, because there are many kinds of conversations happening, because there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work to get done between now and when Congress takes action and presents something for the President to sign.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And like I said, we remain hopeful that we can achieve something significant here, something the American people clearly support, which is a balanced package to reduce the deficit significantly.\xc2\xa0 We also believe it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that Congress prepare to take action short of that, if you will, that ensures that we will not default on our obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, any concern that the veto threat of cap -- cut, cap, and balance --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me help you with that.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s more like dunk, dodge, and dismantle -- (laughter).<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any concern of the veto threat?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were ready with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Just came to me. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any concerns that a veto threat on that could jeopardize the delicate job of finding the right number of votes in the House?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Look, what we are witnessing here with this measure is classic Washington posturing, kabuki theater.\xc2\xa0 This is a measure that is designed to duck, dodge, and dismantle -- duck responsibility, dodge obligations, and dismantle, eventually, if enshrined into law -- which it will not be -- but it would essentially require the dismantlement of our social safety net:\xc2\xa0 Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would, at the very least, require the kinds of cuts that are required under the Ryan budget that emerged from the House Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And it could essentially be worse, because it institutes the kind of across-the-board cuts by calling -- it\xe2\x80\x99s very cleverly designed so that they can claim this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the case because it\xe2\x80\x99s very vague, but it requires the passage of a balanced budget amendment, all of which -- under consideration in Congress right now -- would require even more draconian cuts, cuts that are even more draconian than the ones that were in the Ryan budget.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That includes 70 percent cut in clean energy, drastic cuts in education, for example, and then significant reductions or dismantling of Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, in terms of the balanced budget amendment.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Congressman Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s plan did not deal with Social Security.\xc2\xa0 But to find the savings, the draconian savings that are called for in these measures, you would have to do that to these programs. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a dodge because -- look, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need these kinds of measures.\xc2\xa0 What we need is Congress to get to work, to agree to compromise, to agree to do the work of the American people, instead of satisfying some narrow slice of the political spectrum, so that we can reduce our deficit in a responsible way that does not heap the burden on single -- small segments of society.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That approach is broadly supported by the American people. And the President -- this is not something -- the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t announce he was for apple pie.\xc2\xa0 This is not easy.\xc2\xa0 The stuff that he has made clear he is willing to do requires him to get outside of his comfort zone, requires Democrats to make tough choices that they would not otherwise want to have to make.\xc2\xa0 But in the name of the bigger prize here, which is significant, game-changing deficit reduction and game-changing legislation in terms of getting our debt under control, it is worth doing. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President continues to believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s the right course -- not sort of going through the motions of pretending you\xe2\x80\x99re for something that\xe2\x80\x99s never going to pass, and that, if you were honest with the American people, would do things that the people would absolutely never support.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it the White House position that some of the votes that are going to take place in the early part of this week are showboats, if you will, and that, ultimately, perhaps the final plan will emerge later in the week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think \xe2\x80\x9cshowboat\xe2\x80\x9d is a short way of saying what I just said.\xc2\xa0 I think that, yes, that because the President has made clear he would veto this measure -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all clear whatever would emerge from Congress -- that this is a distraction assembly.\xc2\xa0 But work continues on the actual measures that have a chance for getting through both houses of Congress and have a chance for becoming law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And certainly on the measure that -- the bottom line measure, which is one that would allow for the debt ceiling to be raised, the one created by Senator McConnell to raise the debt ceiling, at the very least, some variation of that needs to be in place so that the United States does not default on its obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Several weeks ago, senior officials here were suggesting that the 15th to the 22nd was kind of crunch time where something really needed to emerge as -- or gel legislatively.\xc2\xa0 Is it still the White House belief that Friday is pretty critical? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nothing has changed to suggest otherwise.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s simply, again, walking back from the firm August 2nd deadline, taking into account what the time allowed -- the time necessary that Congress -- the time required that Congress tends to need to push legislation through and the process to move forward.\xc2\xa0 So the 22nd is not a hard deadline; nothing happens on the 22nd.\xc2\xa0 But we need to -- this is an essential week.\xc2\xa0 We need to continue to work collectively towards a resolution here.\xc2\xa0 So this is very important this week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sign a short-term deal, and yet given that the McConnell plan only allows him to increase the debt ceiling in increments, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that in essence a short-term deal?\xc2\xa0 And is he revising his --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think you understand the distinction between the toll booth kind of short-term deal that was put forward that had to do with the linkage between the essentially linking two things that are unrelated, which is the raising the debt ceiling and the dollar-for-dollar linkage in terms of deficit reduction that was put forward by Speaker Boehner.\xc2\xa0 He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to sign that kind of short-term deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The measure, as you know, that Senator McConnell has proposed would essentially turn authority for raising the debt ceiling -- for being the responsible party and not allowing the United States to default on its obligation -- over to the United States -- the President of the United States rather than the United States Congress, which has traditionally held that responsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If necessary -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not the preferred outcome, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the desired outcome, because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, at least by itself, do the things that are possible here in terms of significant deficit reduction -- we would -- that\xe2\x80\x99s better than allowing the United States to default on its obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he consider the McConnell plan, though, to be a short-term deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for semantics here that -- again, you need to understand the distinction here.\xc2\xa0 It is a short-term deal as written.\xc2\xa0 It requires two or three different votes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a wholly different kind of measure than the ones we were talking about when it\xe2\x80\x99s an up or down vote that requires congressional passage and deficit in their eyes -- concurrent deficit reduction measures that go along with raising the debt ceiling in short tranches into next year.\xc2\xa0 This is different because, again, it turns the authority over to the President and requires Congress to override a veto.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re different -- not the best outcome.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what has happened in this town in the last few weeks is the perfect example, at one level, of what Americans hate about Washington, which is when the opportunity for bipartisan cooperation is clear, where both sides agree on what the problem is, both sides agree on what the size of the solution should be, and there is vast agreement pretty much everywhere except for in some quarters on Capitol Hill on what a balanced package should look like -- that has support overwhelmingly from a majority of Americans -- if there were ever an opportunity here to do something big it is now.\xc2\xa0 And instead, there is the real possibility that this opportunity will be missed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Moody\xe2\x80\x99s has said that they don\xe2\x80\x99t think the debt ceiling is necessary.\xc2\xa0 What the administration\xe2\x80\x99s stance on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, I saw that story.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a stance right now.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have the time to litigate or hypothesize about something like that.\xc2\xa0 The system as it exists is what we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with now.\xc2\xa0 We have a limited time frame within which to work and to get this done, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, one of the participants in the President\xe2\x80\x99s education roundtable with business leaders was Fred Humphries, who\xe2\x80\x99s Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s top lobbyist.\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a violation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s pledge to eliminate access and influence --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you know that -- first of all, there were numerous participants in this meeting, including Secretary Spellings, the education secretary from the George W. Bush administration, who also now does some lobbying.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s promise was not to eliminate or prohibit lobbyists from entering the property, but to not give them special access. And, again, this was a widely attended meeting from people of a variety of backgrounds who are very much engaged in this particular issue.\xc2\xa0 So the answer is no, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said Friday isn\xe2\x80\x99t a hard deadline, but do you think a deal will be in place by then?\xc2\xa0 And if not, what do you think\xc2\xa0 -- how do you think markets will react to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re asking me to predict how markets will react in the -- if I were, I would advise you not to buy and sell accordingly.\xc2\xa0 But without -- again, it\'s not a hard deadline, but Congress, the administration, all of us working together need to move this ball down the field this week to make sure that by next week we know that there will be an outcome that at the very least ensures that the United States does not default on its obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, another ratings agency, a much smaller one, called Egan-Jones, in Pennsylvania, over the weekend downgraded the U.S. debt.\xc2\xa0 Now, obviously they\'re not Moody\'s or S&amp;P, but what does the administration say to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware of it.\xc2\xa0 The overall news about ratings agencies would generate the same response, which is that we have to, obviously, do what the leaders of Congress have said they would do, which is work together with us to make sure we do not default.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau nominee, would the administration make any changes to the bureau to secure confirmation, such as possibly giving Congress the power over the bureau\'s budget?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The bureau as it exists is the way it should exist.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not -- the President believes that Richard Cordray is the right person for this job, that the committee and the Senate needs to act accordingly and confirm him so that this important bureau continues the work it\'s already started, to ensuring that American consumers get the kind of protection they so desperately need in dealing with financial matters, and the kind of protection they lacked in the collapse that caused the greatest recession since the Great Depression.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, would July 22nd be the day on which President Obama would say, look, I\'m not going to get a bigger deal, let\'s go with the McConnell format?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that I can give you a day or an hour when a decision is made about what horse we\'re riding, if you will.\xc2\xa0 We are pursuing several avenues right now, several options.\xc2\xa0 As I think many of you have reported, the legislation being crafted by Senator McConnell, in his own words, is a last-ditch option.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a -- in our words, it\'s not the preferred outcome here.\xc2\xa0 But obviously work is continuing on that to ensure that it is there and in place in a way that is acceptable to majorities of the House and the Senate, and acceptable to the White House, so the we can be sure that action is taken in a timely fashion so that we do not, for the first time, default on our obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when the President says, as he did in the Rose Garden a few minutes ago, that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want politics to stand in the way of an agreement, does he not draw a distinction between politics and principle on these matters?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He does.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that, rightfully so, every party to these negotiations brings their principles to the table.\xc2\xa0 But what is clear is that there is a way to reach a compromise where everyone is able to maintain their principles.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply say that Ronald Reagan was able to do it; Bill Clinton was able to do it; Newt Gingrich, Tip O\'Neill were able to do it.\xc2\xa0 I certainly think that this President -- I know this President is willing to do it and can do it and still maintain the principles that he thinks are vital.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure that the leaders in Congress can do the same.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the American people expect us to do.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on Mark\'s question, is it fair to say that around July 22nd, give or take --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You guys are awfully obsessed with deadlines.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t set the July 22nd --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t set -- I have said so many times now that this was -- I mean, I don\'t know how many times I can explain to you -- nobody set -- there\'s an August 2nd deadline.\xc2\xa0 The July 22nd idea emanated from a walking back in time from August 2nd as a rough estimate of the time you would need in Congress to allow for legislation to move through and become law. So --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If there is not a deal by around that time, then is the assumption that it will be the fallback option?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we wait and see how things look in a few days or maybe even on Friday before I make any announcements about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- be enough time to do something significant?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the folks in Congress ultimately have to decide what they can do in what amount of time.\xc2\xa0 What is clear is that this week we have to crystallize what the options are and what we are going to pursue.\xc2\xa0 And there is action ongoing -- as those of you who report off the Hill, or your colleagues who do -- that there is obviously a lot of conversations going on and different things being drafted and ideas being discussed to see what the different measures might look like, and in particular, the one that Senator McConnell has put forward -- the Senator McConnell debt ceiling bill -- how that would look, working with Senator Reid and others.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re part of those conversations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, were these negotiations discussed between the President and Warren Buffett earlier today?\xc2\xa0 Did they -- did Warren Buffett talk about the debt debate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I believe they did.\xc2\xa0 I confess I did not speak to either man after that.\xc2\xa0 But I think Mr. Buffett went out and spoke -- did a television interview in which he discussed the need for Washington to act, the need to ensure that the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t default, and also, the need to deal with our deficits in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to assume that that was included in their conversation, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that for a fact because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said a minute ago that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve called on Mara.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you in a second.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, wonderful.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question about Elizabeth Warren -- you said that some Republican senators have made it clear they will have blanket opposition to this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s 44, actually, so it certainly is a filibuster-proof majority.\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99re going to reject any nominee, what makes you think that Cordray has a better chance of being confirmed?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you can point to?\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve categorically ruled out making the structural changes that the Republicans are demanding, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to continue to fight against efforts to weaken the agency, and we believe that Mr. Cordray is the right person for the job and we will push that forward.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I know you want to fast-forward to a situation where we --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, actually, I want to go fast-backward, which is if you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get anybody through unless you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to make the reforms that they are demanding --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we think they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to argue, and we\xe2\x80\x99re taking the case right now -- making the case right now that the American people deserve the protections that this agency, this bureau provides, and the leadership that Mr. Cordray will provide, and that their absolute rejection of that is contrary to the best interests of the American people.\xc2\xa0 So we are going to make that case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to budge on the reforms they\xe2\x80\x99re demanding, and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to confirm anybody.\xc2\xa0 My question is:\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get someone confirmed and you\xe2\x80\x99re just going to have a big teaching moment here on these issues, why not do it with Elizabeth Warren?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered questions about why we\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen Mr. Cordray.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the best person for the job.\xc2\xa0 There is no mystery that Elizabeth Warren was opposed by Republican senators -- who opposed basically the whole idea.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting and worth exploring the millions and millions\xc2\xa0 -- tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars spent by lobbyist groups in opposition to this Consumer Protection Bureau.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my point is that, yes, we are going to continue to make the case that the CFPB is essential to defend average Americans\xe2\x80\x99 interests and that opposition to it is contrary to the best interest of the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you deny that she wanted the job?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you have to ask Elizabeth Warren.\xc2\xa0 She did an excellent job.\xc2\xa0 She supports -- she handpicked Richard Cordray for the bureau, for the chief enforcement job, and strongly supports his nomination today.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re both superb public servants.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On the debt talks, you talk about how even a smaller deal has to have -- be balanced, has to have some kind of revenue in it.\xc2\xa0 Can you be --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I said that when we talk about options --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A medium sized --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mid-sized deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Medium size, medium size.\xc2\xa0 Can you be specific about what that means?\xc2\xa0 Does it have to be a certain percentage or proportion of the final deal that comes --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a certain percentage or proportion for you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or just some symbolic loophole closings?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be -- this is not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not symbolic when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about millions or billions of dollars that, in the name of deficit reduction, would otherwise be charged to a senior citizen, to the tune of, say, $6,400 a year in the Ryan budget plan, for example.\xc2\xa0 So this is not symbolic; this is real money.\xc2\xa0 And the only -- the reason -- you do not have to dismantle some of the most sacred protections that we have for our citizens -- Social Security and Medicare -- in order to do this, as long as you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to do it in a balanced way. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what I would say is that it is -- I can be very specific about certainly what would be included in a medium-size deal.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, because there is a lot of talk about tax hikes on the American people, job-killing tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what -- if their argument is that the unfair advantage that the owners of corporate jets is somehow desirable to create jobs, they ought to go out and make that argument. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do they think that an oil and gas industry that is raking in record profits because of high energy prices, that they deserve these special subsidies that other businesses and industries don\xe2\x80\x99t get?\xc2\xa0 They ought to make that argument, because that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about this within the context of continuing to lower taxes for the middle class, which this President has done since he came into office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But you just described -- you said you can\xe2\x80\x99t be very specific, and then you just gave some examples that add up to small --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Billions.\xc2\xa0 Billions of dollars.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but not -- but corporate jets and oil and gas subsidies don\xe2\x80\x99t add up to a tremendous amount of money.\xc2\xa0 Is that all the President is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are you telling me that the Republicans are willing to give on that?\xc2\xa0 Because that would be welcome news.\xc2\xa0 So far, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you what\xe2\x80\x99s your bottom line on revenues in a medium-size deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to issue or negotiate a bottom line to a package from here.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that if there is a willingness to compromise, that a mid-sized deal does not require -- would allow for significant deficit reduction and does not require major concessions from either side.\xc2\xa0 And which is why it is so puzzling, or would be -- I imagine is -- for most Americans when they\xe2\x80\x99re presented with what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Washington and they\xe2\x80\x99re scratching their heads and thinking, why can\xe2\x80\x99t they just get it done?\xc2\xa0 And the President has made clear he is ready and willing to get it done, and he is waiting for partners.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one last question.\xc2\xa0 He mentioned again today the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 Is that now a requirement to be part of the deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not negotiating particulars in the deal.\xc2\xa0 The President has made very clear, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear, that we are for an extension of the payroll tax cut, which has put, for this year, $1,000 in the average American family\xe2\x80\x99s pocket, and if we extend it another year we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the same next year.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s money that American families need.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s money that will go right into the economy, right into the bloodstream, will help grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 We think that\xe2\x80\x99s very worth doing for a variety of reasons. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it continues a practice that this President began when he took office, which is reducing taxes for middle-class families, and we believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Bachmann and Associates, the Minnesota-based clinic owned by Michele Bachmann, has been receiving attention recently because it\xe2\x80\x99s been revealed that it\xe2\x80\x99s engaging in widely discredited reparative therapy aimed at turning gay people into being straight.\xc2\xa0 Furthermore, the clinic has been shown to be a recipient of federal money.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s received $137,000 in Medicaid funding since 2005.\xc2\xa0 What does the President think of ex-gay reparative therapy, and should federal funds be used to support this practice?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chris, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that conversation with him, and I think that I would steer you to HHS since it involves Medicaid funding.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have a comment.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it seems strange to me that you can\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about it, because our President has described himself as a fierce advocate for LGBT Americans.\xc2\xa0 Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you say anything about a practice that is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about it, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize his thoughts on this.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, on an issue of Medicaid funding, it is best asked of HHS.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a follow-up question.\xc2\xa0 To spell out that these practices shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be subsidized by the federal government, would the President be open to issuing an executive order mandating that federal funds cannot be used to discriminate or harm LGBT Americans?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate on behalf of the President or venture a guess what he may or may not be open to.\xc2\xa0 Again, on the specific issues of Medicaid funding, I send you to HHS.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, with the House action on the debt/deficit this week, is there any potential that the posturing or the kabuki could actually be constructive?\xc2\xa0 Is it possible that if they cast a vote --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let it be so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it possible?\xc2\xa0 Does the President think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that if they get a chance to cast a vote, then they\xe2\x80\x99re more amenable to discussions as a group, as a conference?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President believes that, but I think if that is, in fact, the case, that would be welcome. I think that obviously we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of time.\xc2\xa0 We need to focus on reaching a compromise that achieves the most significant deficit reduction possible.\xc2\xa0 We have issued our statement of administration policy and the fact that the President would veto this measure.\xc2\xa0 But if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, then that would be great.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you, just to clarify, there is no executive authority that the President can use or will use on his own without being granted that power from Congress, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For what?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To lift the debt ceiling.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a constitutional lawyer, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so.\xc2\xa0 As I understand it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s settled?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the 14th Amendment, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, not in the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have been very clear --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said he hoped we wouldn\'t get to the point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But we have been very clear for a long time -- I mean, I have, and I can go back and find you the language we\xe2\x80\x99ve used, pretty categorical -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not exploring this; that\xe2\x80\x99s not an option.\xc2\xa0 There is no mechanism that allows us to get around the fact that on August 2nd, if the measures haven\xe2\x80\x99t been taken, we go into default. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So any fallback has to involve Congress --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no question?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And can I get back to Mara\xe2\x80\x99s question?\xc2\xa0 With the time going and the discussions where they are, what leverage does the President have to get that balanced package now?\xc2\xa0 What does he think his leverage is?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the American people -- pretty good leverage -- the fact that they overwhelmingly support a balanced approach; that even majorities of Republicans support a balanced approach; that voices from all over the Republican Party, even a handful who are actually elected members of the Republican Party, have now said that they support a balanced approach. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a deal that\xe2\x80\x99s right on the table to be had.\xc2\xa0 The particulars are well known to the participants in the room.\xc2\xa0 What the President is willing to do is well known to the leaders of Congress of both parties.\xc2\xa0 And what is required of them is well known as well.\xc2\xa0 If you want significant deficit reduction, the kind that was supposed to be the goal, it\xe2\x80\x99s right there for the taking, if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to compromise in a way that the American people overwhelmingly want their elected officials to compromise.\xc2\xa0 So that would be the leverage.\xc2\xa0 Usually popular opinion has some effect in Washington. Let it be so again in the coming days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 However, what is absolutely uncontested and uncontestable is that we have to take measures to ensure we don\xe2\x80\x99t default.\xc2\xa0 So we are pursuing that track.\xc2\xa0 And understand that, as the President said, if Congress, as is its wont, does not act, at least let\xe2\x80\x99s take measures to avoid Armageddon.\xc2\xa0 So we are making sure that that those avenues are being explored.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did the President meet with the Warren Buffett group?\xc2\xa0 Is he signing the pledge to devote much of his wealth to charitable concerns?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we have some information on that.\xc2\xa0 Why did he meet with them?\xc2\xa0 Because he thinks that what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is extraordinarily noble and good.\xc2\xa0 But let me see what I have here on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s met with them before.\xc2\xa0 Is he offering to sign the pledge --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He received an update on the Giving Pledge, which invites the wealthiest individuals and families to give the majority of their wealth to philanthropy, and discussed the ways in which private philanthropy can help address our nation\xe2\x80\x99s greatest challenges. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as you noted, Warren Buffett, Bill and Melinda Gates and others who have taken the pledge were participants in that meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you have nothing on the President\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing else.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Christi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you know if the President sought spiritual advice from the Dalai Lama when they met over the weekend?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we gave a readout of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 I think there was -- it was a meeting, the likes of which he and other Presidents have had with the Dalai Lama, who is an important religious and cultural leader.\xc2\xa0 But not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did they meet in the Oval Office, by the way?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Let me see, I have something on this.\xc2\xa0 It was not in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 But he is a Nobel Prize Laureate, as you know, and an internationally recognized religious and cultural leader.\xc2\xa0 And the President meets with him, as other Presidents have, in that capacity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the Dalai Lama was an expression of his support for the preservation of Tibet\xe2\x80\x99s unique traditions and the rights of the Tibetan people.\xc2\xa0 The President encourages the resumption of dialogue between the Dalai Lama\xe2\x80\x99s representatives and the Chinese government to resolve longstanding differences.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The U.S. position on the status of Tibet has not changed.\xc2\xa0 We consider Tibet to be part of the People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of China and do not support independence for Tibet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Glenn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two questions.\xc2\xa0 Since the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily support Elizabeth Warren for this post, would he consider supporting her for the Senate seat in Massachusetts?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a question you ought to pose to Elizabeth Warren --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t ask her what the President thinks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- in terms of what her -- well, let\xe2\x80\x99s see what she decides to do.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he ever spoken about that topic to you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the second question is, we have figures I guess ranging between $1.4 and $1.7 trillion in terms of mutually agreed-upon potential deficit reductions.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us -- without getting really granular, can you give us some sense, the American people some sense as to what you are actually considering cutting?\xc2\xa0 What is the composition of those cuts, broadly speaking?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The composition includes discretionary spending and what are called non-health care mandatories -- programs -- subsidies, agricultural subsidies and other programs that -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s the package that leads you up to $1.7 trillion that we discussed last week.\xc2\xa0 And that was on the table in the final meeting -- or rather some of the final meetings last week -- as a general starting point upon which we should and could build if everyone were willing to compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just say, I want to make sure that -- we have a 2:30 p.m. here with Secretary Powell and Mrs. Powell -- they want to go to the stakeout.\xc2\xa0 So I want to make sure to give you guys the opportunity to do that.\xc2\xa0 So let me just take one or two more.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, question -- the President and the First Family watched the World Cup match.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the reaction of the First Family and the President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak with them specifically about this.\xc2\xa0 But obviously it was an amazing match and disappointing for fans of the U.S. team, but a really, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, gratifying victory for the Japanese team.\xc2\xa0 And we congratulate the Japanese women on their victory.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me do April.\xc2\xa0 One more.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jay, did the President call Nelson Mandela -- who he\'s affectionately termed as Madiba, the Father of the Nation \xe2\x80\x93 or do a statement about Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s 93rd birthday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we -- I believe he did not.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the First Lady recently visited with Nelson Mandela, just last month I believe.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously wish him best regards on his birthday, and he is quite an extraordinary man.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, going back to that -- the President was here Friday and throughout the last couple of days, talking about the fact that Democrats are upset with him.\xc2\xa0 What is he planning to do to calm the waters after this is all done -- let\xe2\x80\x99s say it\xe2\x80\x99s done by the August 2nd deadline, what is he planning to do to calm the waters with his fellow Democrats?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, the fact that he is willing to support measures that require Democrats to get outside of their comfort zones is a fact.\xc2\xa0 And he made the case compellingly, I think, from this podium on Friday, over why progressives should support deficit reduction, precisely because we need to get our fiscal house in order so that we can continue to invest in the key programs, in the key initiatives that will allow our country to grow, create jobs, and protect those in our society who need protection.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think he -- all he has to do is make the case, and he will continue to make that case, that a balanced approach to deficit reduction is in the interest of progressives, as well as every other American -- because we need to grow the economy and create jobs, and we need to get our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 And he thinks that that is vital for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it necessarily just deficit reduction or the programs that he is trying to cut?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It requires tough choices.\xc2\xa0 There are no easy choices here.\xc2\xa0 We are not at a point where you can find a lot of low-hanging fruit in term of reducing spending.\xc2\xa0 So they were -- reducing spending requires making tough choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what he has said is that you have to have a balanced approach so that you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to do anything draconian, the way that the House Republican budget did in order to ensure substantial tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans -- in fact, additional tax cuts for the wealthy Americans.\xc2\xa0 The House Republican required, in order to reach the $4 trillion mark, required significant reductions in discretionary spending, including clean energy and education; significant restructuring or elimination of Medicare as we know it in order to pay for, if you will, both the deficit reduction and the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans; required senior citizens to get stuck with an extra $6,000 bill because of the need to eliminate Medicare as we know it in order to fund these other priorities. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So those are not the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities.\xc2\xa0 If you do it in a balanced way you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 2:26 P.M.
