Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t**Please see correction below marked by an asterisk.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t2:24 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0I appreciate your patience on the schedule today. \xc2\xa0Obviously both Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton had announcements they wanted to make today, and so I was doing my best to get out of their way and give them the opportunity to go first. \xc2\xa0And now I am here to answer any questions you may have about their announcements or any other topics that may be on your mind today.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, Kevin, do you want to start? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure, Josh. \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0So I guess let\xe2\x80\x99s just start with the obvious. \xc2\xa0Could you give us a little bit of the readout of what the President and Senator Sanders talked about during that hour-long meeting? \xc2\xa0Did they make any requests of each other?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously, the President was pleased to have an opportunity to welcome Senator Sanders to the White House and congratulate him on the remarkable success that he enjoyed in the context of his Democratic -- his campaign for the Democratic nomination for President. Senator Sanders competed in every state across the country and earned more than 10 million votes for his campaign. \xc2\xa0That\'s a remarkable accomplishment, and the President complimented him and congratulated him on his success.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think you could describe the conversation as a friendly conversation that was focused on the future. \xc2\xa0Part of that future conversation was about the importance of the upcoming general election. \xc2\xa0You\'ve heard the President say on a number of occasions how important it is to him personally that he be succeeded in office by a President who is committed to building on the remarkable progress that our country has made over the last seven and a half years. \xc2\xa0So that certainly was an important part of the conversation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it went beyond that. \xc2\xa0There also was a conversation about the long-term future of the Democratic Party. \xc2\xa0And Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s campaign enjoyed so much success because he was able to inspire a lot of young people -- both Democrats and independents -- to support his campaign and to be engaged in the political process. \xc2\xa0That\'s a good thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd President Obama and Senator Sanders had an opportunity to talk about what work they could potentially do together in the future to ensure that the Democratic Party of the 21st century is diverse and vibrant and inclusive. \xc2\xa0That\'s been a long-stated goal of President Obama. \xc2\xa0And obviously President Obama had his own success in building a coalition that involved a lot of young Americans -- and not all Democrats.</p>\n<p>\n\tSenator Sanders built on that progress, and they\'re hopeful that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to work together in the future, not just at the national level but also at the state and local levels, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did they make any requests of each other?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do my best to protect their ability to have a private conversation. \xc2\xa0But I think what is clear is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of agreement about the way forward. \xc2\xa0Obviously, there is a lot of agreement when it comes to the future of the Democratic Party that I just described. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s also a lot of agreement about the highest priorities that the next President will have to grapple with. \xc2\xa0And so these priorities range from issues like addressing economic inequality and countering the influence of special interests in our politics, these are obviously issues that Senator Sanders discussed quite extensively on the campaign trail. \xc2\xa0But these are also issues that President Obama has had an opportunity to address.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as you heard from Senator Sanders in the driveway a couple of hours ago, there also was a discussion about other issues like expanding economic opportunity for the middle class; making sure that we keep our commitment to our veterans; making sure that we give college graduates in this country the opportunity to succeed and not just be weighted down with extraordinary debt. \xc2\xa0So again, these are all issues that President Obama has spent the last seven years fighting for. \xc2\xa0And Senator Sanders has spent a significant amount of time talking about these issues, too -- not just in the context of his presidential campaign, but in the context of his decades in public service.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President gave the Senator the courtesy of letting him know that he would be endorsing Secretary Clinton in the coming moments or hours. \xc2\xa0Could you just provide a little bit of how the President broke that to him -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it was probably expected -- and what was the response? \xc2\xa0And is the President disappointed that Senator Sanders did not go outside of the White House, and in talking to reporters did not endorse Clinton?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me start by saying that, no. \xc2\xa0Senator Sanders I think has been quite clear that he intended to compete for votes in the upcoming District of Columbia primary that\'s scheduled for Tuesday. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t think anybody had the expectation that Senator Sanders was going to deviate from that plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, to go back to your first question, the President has had the opportunity to speak to Senator Sanders now three times in the last week. \xc2\xa0And as a result of those conversations I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that Senator Sanders was not at all surprised by today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did the President show Senator Sanders the video? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the details of their interactions, but I assure you that Senator Sanders was not surprised. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, look, Senator Sanders began his statement in the driveway in front of the White House today by saying that President Obama and Vice President Biden had made a commitment to him early in the process that they would not put their thumb on the scale. \xc2\xa0And Senator Sanders himself said how much he appreciated that President Obama and Vice President Biden kept that promise.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When was the video recorded? \xc2\xa0And why was it decided that the endorsement would be done through video rather than having an event or some kind of other alternative?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The video was recorded on Tuesday. \xc2\xa0And I think Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign has already announced that there will be an event, and the President is very much looking forward to traveling to Green Bay, Wisconsin, Titletown, with Secretary Clinton to appear with her in person at a campaign event and build support for her campaign in the state of Wisconsin, a state that President Obama won twice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And does he have other plans next week to do campaign-related events for Secretary Clinton?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s the only campaign event that\'s on the schedule at this point, but I would anticipate that it\xe2\x80\x99s only the first of many campaign events between now and November.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You mentioned in the meeting things that the President would like to see, working together on those issues. \xc2\xa0Did Sanders also have things that he wanted to see from the White House? \xc2\xa0Or did he have any particular asks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Senator Sanders characterize the points that he raised in their meeting. \xc2\xa0And I think he did that, again, when he spoke to you a couple of hours ago. \xc2\xa0He was quite direct about his appreciation to the President for keeping his promise not to weigh in in the primary process and give Democratic voters across the country the opportunity to make a decision about who should represent our party in the general election. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Senator Sanders, I think -- again, when I spoke to the President briefly about his conversation with Senator Sanders, I think both men are pretty enthusiastic about the opportunity that lies ahead, not just in advance of the general election, but over the course of a generation to ensure that the future of the Democratic looks as diverse and vibrant and inclusive as our country is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did the President ask Sanders to step out of the race sooner rather than later? \xc2\xa0And did he want him to step out before the D.C. primaries?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as I mentioned yesterday when I spoke to a group of you, Senator Sanders has more than earned the right to make his own decision on his own timeframe about the future of his campaign. \xc2\xa0And the President certainly respects the important work that Senator Sanders has done on the campaign trail. \xc2\xa0He certainly respects the strong support that he\'s built in all 50 states. \xc2\xa0And that means that Senator Sanders gets to decide what the future of his campaign looks like. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'ll just point out -- again, when Senator Sanders spoke to all of you after meeting with the President, Senator Sanders reiterated how critically important it is for President Obama to be succeeded by a President who shares our values and is committed to building on the progress that this country has made under President Obama\'s leadership. \xc2\xa0That certainly was part of the conversation in the Oval Office. \xc2\xa0And Senator Sanders, when he spoke to all of you, made clear that that was a priority. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, what was the point and the outcome of this meeting? \xc2\xa0What was decided between the two of them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, I think the point was for President Obama and Senator Sanders to continue the conversation that they\'ve been having over the course of this week. \xc2\xa0And, look, in some ways, this is a conversation that dates all the way back to January when -- or February, whenever it was that Senator Sanders was here at the White House much earlier in the campaign. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there was any expectation either on the part of Senator Sanders or President Obama that Senator Sanders was going to make some abrupt change to his campaign strategy, which at this point has included competing in the D.C. primary that\'s scheduled for Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So why release it on Twitter? \xc2\xa0And why have it come from Clinton instead of the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think obviously it makes -- there\'s some intuitive decisions about why it\'s important to give Secretary Clinton the opportunity to make this news. \xc2\xa0Obviously, I saw some of the early comments from her campaign that she was deeply appreciative of the President\'s endorsement. \xc2\xa0And the President was pleased to have the opportunity to share it. \xc2\xa0But it certainly is the decision for Secretary Clinton and her team to make about how best to use this material to advance her campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And speaking of Twitter, you see a lot of Sanders supporters now putting out their continued support for Sanders, many of them saying, well, it\'s Bernie or nobody -- it won\'t be Clinton. \xc2\xa0What do you think is going to be the President\'s best approach, now that he is going to be out on the trail in a matter of days, to winning over those people?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, first of all, it\'s going to be Secretary Clinton\'s responsibility to win over those people. \xc2\xa0And I\'m confident that she will have a very forceful case to make about the values that she represents. \xc2\xa0And so I think she\'ll have a strong case to make, but that\'s ultimately a case that she will make.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut President Obama certainly has a lot of credibility with those voters, I think that is true. \xc2\xa0President Obama, over the course of the last seven years, has fought very hard for many of the principles and priorities that Senator Sanders has been talking about over the course of this campaign. \xc2\xa0Senator Sanders has devoted an extraordinary amount of time to making sure that Wall Street doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run amuck and trample on middle-class families. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I can recite you -- I\'ll probably spare you at least right now -- a long recitation of all of the things that President Obama has done by implementing Wall Street reform to make sure that taxpayers are not on the hook for bailing out big banks that make risky bets, and also making sure that we\'re focused on expanding economic opportunity for the middle class. \xc2\xa0That is entirely consistent with a message that was spread by Senator Sanders in his campaign that clearly deeply resonated with voters -- young and old, Democrat and independent -- all across the country. \xc2\xa0So President Obama has a lot of credibility with those voters. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd look, here\'s the last thing: \xc2\xa0Senator Sanders obviously has a lot of credibility with those voters. \xc2\xa0And you heard Senator Sanders say to all of you just a couple of hours ago how critically important it is that President Obama be succeeded by somebody who shares our values and is dedicated to those progressive priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are any number of people -- Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders, and President Obama -- who can make a very forceful case to those who were enthusiastic supports of Senator Sanders in the primary.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you mentioned that the President we obviously know will be out next week with Secretary Clinton, and intends to be out many other times. \xc2\xa0How eager is he to get out there on the campaign trail again? \xc2\xa0I mean, is this like one more campaign for him? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President is very enthusiastic about the opportunity that he will have over the course of the next several months to make a strong case in support of Secretary Clinton. \xc2\xa0I think that is evident from the comments that President Obama made in Elkhart, Indiana last week. \xc2\xa0The stakes in this election are high, particularly if you take a look at the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0We\'ve made enormous progress over the last seven years, digging out of the ditch created by the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. \xc2\xa0The private sector is what led that recovery, but the private sector would not have succeeded without the important policy decisions that were made in the first couple of months of President Obama\'s presidency.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo for those voters who are focused on the economy, we\'ve got a pretty strong case to make about the wisdom of the decisions made by President Obama and the commitment by Secretary Clinton to those principles. \xc2\xa0But I also think it was pretty evident from that video and from his appearance on "The Tonight Show" with Jimmy Fallon that will air tonight at 11:30 -- that\'s a free plug there, Peter, for your network -- but I think anybody who has an opportunity to watch that interview will see that the President is quite enthusiastic about this election and about the prospect of being succeeded in office by Secretary Clinton.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I noticed in that video he seems to give Secretary Clinton some credit for the bin Laden decision. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s mentioned in the video. \xc2\xa0But that was really his decision alone, he said in the past. \xc2\xa0What role did she have in that critical decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the point of that video, where the President talks about her courage and her compassion and her heart, and how her service to the country are critically important to -- were critically important to his decision to endorse her in this campaign. \xc2\xa0And I think the point that he\xe2\x80\x99s making in the video is that he chose to have Secretary Clinton by his side for the first four years of his presidency as he was making difficult decisions that had enormous consequences for the United States and our citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was she part of that decision? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s certainly in that picture where that decision is be executed. \xc2\xa0And she certainly was an important architect of the kinds of foreign policy decisions and strategic decisions that President Obama had to make over the first four years of his presidency.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been tracking her Twitter feed up there --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- but it may not surprise you that Donald Trump has tweeted.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cObama just endorsed crooked Hillary. \xc2\xa0He wants four more years of Obama, but nobody else does.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Is that what he wants? \xc2\xa0Four more years of Obama? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, no. \xc2\xa0I think there have been a number of occasions over the last several months where you all have pointed out to me some differences between Secretary Clinton and President Obama. \xc2\xa0So they do not have the same opinion on every issue. \xc2\xa0But I think, again, just to go back to this video that was released today, the President said unequivocally that he does not believe -- at least he can\xe2\x80\x99t remember somebody who has been more qualified -- a candidate that\xe2\x80\x99s been more qualified to hold this office.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd after getting to know her personally, working closely with her in the first four years of this administration, and spending more than a year on the campaign trail competing against her in the 2008 presidential election, the President has had to opportunity to watch Secretary Clinton perform up close. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s seen her tenacity, her dedication, her commitment to a set of principles that they share. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is quite enthusiastic about her campaign. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move around. \xc2\xa0Toluse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Can you at this point confirm that the President did vote for Secretary Clinton during the Illinois primary a few months back?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I did not ask the President about which box he checked on his ballot, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that he changed his mind at any point over the course of the primary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And now that the endorsement is officially out, I want to sort of revisit a question that you were asked a couple of days ago about the First Lady. \xc2\xa0She\xe2\x80\x99s going to be doing an event, the "[United] State of Women," I believe next week. \xc2\xa0Can we expect to see her, now that we have our first woman nominee, sort of make the case for Secretary Clinton on the campaign trail as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, that event that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to is one that has been in the works for months now here at the White House. \xc2\xa0So it is not a campaign event. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s an official event to talk about a series of issues that are critically important to America\xe2\x80\x99s women and American families. \xc2\xa0And there are a wide range of issues that they\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss. \xc2\xa0Part of that event includes a conversation that the First Lady will have with Oprah Winfrey. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it will come up in the context of that conversation, but this is an event that was planned independent of any consideration of Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, I think it is entirely fair for you to interpret President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s remarks in the video that was released today as consistent with the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s views of the campaign. \xc2\xa0The First Lady is enthusiastic about Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, and you can certainly interpret that video as a joint endorsement.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd at some point -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly when that will be -- but at some point, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the First Lady will \xc2\xa0have an opportunity to share her own views in her own words about why she believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Secretary Clinton to succeed President Obama. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll end by reminding you that there are a number of occasions where Mrs. Obama has discussed her deep admiration for Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s public service, her career. \xc2\xa0She\xe2\x80\x99s been a trailblazer, and Mrs. Obama deeply respects what Secretary Clinton has done and the issues that she\xe2\x80\x99s fought for over the course of her long career. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more. \xc2\xa0Yesterday, the President at the fundraiser said that he was concerned about the ability of the Democrats to do sort of the hard work of the ground game of turning out young voters, low-income voters, like he did in 2008 and 2012. \xc2\xa0Is that sort of a tacit criticism of the Clinton campaign, that she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to reach those voters so far?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not. \xc2\xa0The President was making a point similar to the point that he made in South Florida at the end of last week, where he talked about how important it is for Democrats to run scared, to not be complacent about what the polls say.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe stakes in this election are high, and the Republican nominee has certainly defied conventional wisdom in the past. \xc2\xa0And his campaign is one that Democrats should take seriously. \xc2\xa0And the President certainly intends to devote a lot of time and energy to making sure that voters all across the country -- Democrats, independents and Republicans -- understand the high stakes. \xc2\xa0And the President will certainly make a strong and clear case for the candidate that he believe is at least as qualified as any other candidate to seek the office of the presidency in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, a couple of questions. \xc2\xa0The Sanders campaign, or Bernie Sanders has been looking at history when it comes to this unification process. \xc2\xa0They have looked at 2008, when Hillary Clinton conceded and Barack Obama reached out his hand for unification with Hillary Clinton. \xc2\xa0For this President, what does the unification process with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders look like, particularly when it comes to his supporters?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, I think you\'re making an important point, which is that there\xe2\x80\x99s some relevant history here; that Secretary Clinton was not in such a different situation than the one facing Senator Sanders today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat Secretary Clinton did -- and this is well-known history now -- is she was justifiably proud of the historic nature of her campaign in 2007 and 2008. \xc2\xa0She was proud of the strong support that she got from voters all across the country. \xc2\xa0But she also made clear that then-Senator Obama was the best opportunity that our country had to advance the priorities that she\xe2\x80\x99d been campaigning on. \xc2\xa0And again, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a relevant analogy to be drawn between what happened eight years ago and what\xe2\x80\x99s happening right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Since you\'re saying this relevant analogy, can you bring us back to how beyond paying for her campaign debt, bring us back to how President Obama worked with Hillary Clinton to get her supporters, who were very angry at the time, like now, to follow him? \xc2\xa0What was that piece that people had --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think -- look, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important is to be respectful of those voters. \xc2\xa0And certainly in 2008, President Obama -- then-Senator Obama was deeply of the investment and commitment that had been shown by then-Senator Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s supporters. \xc2\xa0And over the course of that summer and fall, President Obama and his campaign -- with the strong support and endorsement of then-Senator Clinton -- made a powerful case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I don\'t think there were too many of those supporters that were converted in a day. \xc2\xa0But over the course of the campaign, I think the President made a strong case. \xc2\xa0And I think Secretary Clinton is certainly well-positioned to do the same thing with regard to Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s supporters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What is the concern in this administration about the independents that could go to Trump, particularly when it comes to issues of trade? \xc2\xa0They didn\'t like Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s trade issues or trade stand, and they were for Bernie Sanders, and they\xe2\x80\x99d vote for Donald Trump?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, as you all have pointed out to me a number of times in this room, all three of the candidates that you just named have the same position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s a different one than President Obama has.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, then lastly, one last piece to Tuesday and the video. \xc2\xa0What time was that video made? \xc2\xa0Was it after New Jersey? \xc2\xa0Or was it during the day? \xc2\xa0Or was it after California? \xc2\xa0What time was that video made?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I believe it was during the day, but it certainly was after a number of your news organizations had declared Hillary Clinton the presumptive Democratic nominee for President.</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0That was the Map Room, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know exactly which room it was. \xc2\xa0It was a room in the White House residence. \xc2\xa0This is --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There are a lot of rooms.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There are. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know which one it was. \xc2\xa0But this is certainly consistent with the practice that previous Presidents have followed when engaged in taping videos for political purposes. \xc2\xa0This is what President Reagan did. \xc2\xa0This is what both President Bushes did. \xc2\xa0This is what President Clinton did. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s what President Obama has done before.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Costs borne by the Hillary campaign?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Either the Hillary campaign or the DNC. \xc2\xa0What I can confirm for you is it was not filmed at government expense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Who wrote the script?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know who was involved in writing the script. \xc2\xa0But again --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Both camps at the White House, and the Hillary campaign, or the DNC?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Some combination I think is the best way to describe it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you have always said in the past that when it comes to the President\xe2\x80\x99s endorsements, it\xe2\x80\x99s the candidate who makes the decision about the timing. \xc2\xa0Your hesitation about confirming that the President may have given a head\xe2\x80\x99s up to Senator Sanders in their meeting, I kind of want to nail that down. \xc2\xa0Did the Hillary Clinton campaign decide when that went up? \xc2\xa0Or did you guys decide when that went up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t recall having said that the candidates themselves determine that. \xc2\xa0Obviously, President Obama made a very purposeful decision over the course of this campaign to not weigh in and to give Democratic voters across the country the opportunity to determine who should represent our party in the general election. \xc2\xa0So the timing of this decision was one that was driven by the President. \xc2\xa0But obviously, as I noted yesterday, the White House had an open line of communication with each campaign. \xc2\xa0And so in order to make sure that Senator Sanders wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised, it required President Obama to communicate with Senator Sanders. \xc2\xa0And in order to make sure that Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign was in a position to release the video, we obviously had to communicate with them, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, poor D.C. voters, right? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Should they just stay home? \xc2\xa0Is that part of the message here, that the decision has been made now, the race is over? \xc2\xa0Their votes don\'t matter as much a California, New Jersey, or other states?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, no, that\'s not how I would describe it. \xc2\xa0I think the President is somebody who has on a number of occasions articulated his view that people should be engaged in the political process. \xc2\xa0People should be engaged in the public debate. \xc2\xa0And certainly an important way to do that is to participate in elections. \xc2\xa0There are delegates that are up for election to the Democratic Convention, and that is something that\'s worth voting on. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, I think what other people have suggested is that there are potentially reforms to the nomination process that could be made that could potentially put District voters in a position to have more influence on the process than they do now.</p>\n<p>\n\tJames.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thank you. \xc2\xa0A few quick different subjects.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President have confidence in Debbie Wasserman Schultz to retain her position through the end of this cycle?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0James, the President was in South Florida at the end of last week, and he talked about her service as the chair of the Democratic National Committee. \xc2\xa0The President appointed her to be the chair of the DNC during his first term, which means that part of her legacy at the DNC is having built a Democratic campaign apparatus that succeeded in reelecting the first African American President of the United States. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama is, of course, the first President since Eisenhower to be elected and reelected with more than 50 percent of the vote. \xc2\xa0And certainly the DNC and the structure that was built and financed through Debbie Wasserman Schultz\xe2\x80\x99s efforts can take some credit for that. \xc2\xa0She should.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President made clear that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has always had his back, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have hers. \xc2\xa0And the President announced his support for her reelection campaign. \xc2\xa0And he certainly is appreciative of all the important work that she has done at the DNC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was there ever any point where the President ever considered endorsing anyone other than Hillary Clinton?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0As I alluded to Toluse, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that the President ever changed his mind in the course of the Democratic primary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You mentioned earlier that President Obama carried Wisconsin twice in a row. \xc2\xa0Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we interpret the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to campaign there with Hillary Clinton as his first outing as a sign of weakness on the part of the Democratic ticket since they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be campaigning in a state where, by all accounts, they should easily be able to retain that state?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President had to compete for Wisconsin both in 2008 and 2012. \xc2\xa0Those were hard-fought elections, but both times he came out on top. \xc2\xa0So I would anticipate a similar outcome in 2016.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Two more things really quickly. \xc2\xa0You just stated at the podium just now that you believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s a very strong case to be made for the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic stewardship over the course of the last seven and a half years. \xc2\xa0Senator Sanders, in his statement in the White House driveway today, painted a very different picture. \xc2\xa0Senator Sanders said that the \xe2\x80\x9cUnited States right now is drifting toward oligarchy.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Does the President agree with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the President certainly agrees that there is more work to be done to address increasing economic inequality in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are we drifting toward oligarchy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Those are Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s words.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m asking if you agree.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what the President agrees with is the notion that there is more that can be done to fight economic inequality in this country. \xc2\xa0And the President has put forward some very specific ideas for how to do that. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, many of those ideas have been blocked by Republicans in Congress. \xc2\xa0We can certainly start by raising the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, I think the President is proud -- and justifiably so -- of the remarkable progress that our country has made over the last seven years. \xc2\xa0But he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not satisfied. \xc2\xa0There is a lot more important work that needs to be done, which is why he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s so important that he\xe2\x80\x99s succeeded by somebody who wants to build on the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made and not tear it down.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Presumably, if you or the President agreed that we are presently drifting toward oligarchy you would have said so in response to my question. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Those are Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s words, and I\xe2\x80\x99m using my own to convey our view.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last subject matter. \xc2\xa0Previously, the President has used one public forum or another to comment on the FBI investigation into Mrs. Clinton and her email conduct. \xc2\xa0At one point, he stated that as far as he could see, there was no real damage done to national security. \xc2\xa0You yourself from this podium have suggested that the investigation wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trending toward any focus on Mrs. Clinton herself. \xc2\xa0I wonder if you could address for us the potential conflict of interest that might exist when the President of the United States, the head of the executive branch, is openly saying, I want this woman to succeed me in the Oval Office, and you have other employees of the executive branch -- career prosecutors, FBI agents -- working this case who now have just heard how the President wants to see this case resolved, in essence. \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there some conflict there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0James, there is not. \xc2\xa0And you noted a couple of instances in which the President had been asked about the FBI investigation, and in each of those answers the President made clear that that investigation is one that is being conducted independent of any sort of political interference. \xc2\xa0That is a principle to which the President is resolutely committed.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou mentioned my comments. \xc2\xa0My comments were actually also in response to a question and were a reference to published reports of comments from FBI officials about the direction of the investigation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, the reason that the President feels confident that he can go out and make this endorsement and record a video in which he describes his strong support for Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is that he knows the people who are conducting the investigation aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be swayed by any sort of political interference. \xc2\xa0They aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be swayed by political forces. \xc2\xa0That they know that the investigation should be guided by the facts and that they should follow the evidence where it leads. \xc2\xa0And the President has complete confidence that that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99ll do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So when a career prosecutor or an FBI agent who\xe2\x80\x99s working on the Clinton investigation hears this President speak openly of how he wants Hillary Clinton to succeed him, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think that that career prosecutor or that FBI agent takes that as some indication of how the President wants to see this case resolved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I think that those career prosecutors understand that they have a job to do, and that that job that they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to -- which is to follow the facts, to pursue the evidence to a logical conclusion -- that that is a job that they are responsible for doing without any sort of political interference. \xc2\xa0And the President expects them to do that job.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, look, this is the reason that we actually ask career federal prosecutors to take the lead on these kinds of matters. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who conduct this investigation. \xc2\xa0They don\xe2\x80\x99t have political jobs. \xc2\xa0They have career jobs as law enforcement officers and as prosecutors and as investigators. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what their responsibility is. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President, when discussing this issue, in each stage has reiterated his commitment to this principle -- that any criminal investigation should be conducted independent of any sort of political interference and that people should be treated the same way before the law, regardless of their political influence, regardless of their political party, regardless of their political stature, and regardless of what political figure has endorsed them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0To your knowledge, has President Obama ever discussed the Department of Justice investigation with Mrs. Clinton?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0He has not. \xc2\xa0He has not. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, to what extent would you say today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Bernie Sanders was -- in front of the cameras, here at the White House -- a formality in some ways to soften the blow not only to him but to so many of his young supporters who are so badly needed on the campaign trail backed by Hillary Clinton?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, I would not describe the meeting as a formality because I think the President is deeply respectful of Senator Sanders and the campaign that he has run over the last year or so. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, they had a serious conversation about the stakes of the upcoming general election and about the future of the Democratic Party, something that both candidates are quite interested in. \xc2\xa0So this was an important meeting. \xc2\xa0This was an important part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s day, and certainly was an important part of Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s day too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But was there a request to get his grassroots supporters on board with Hillary Clinton?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look -- no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any sort of specific requests like that. \xc2\xa0I think this was an opportunity for the President and Senator Sanders to sit down and discuss the future. \xc2\xa0They did it in friendly terms -- I think you guys saw them walking on the colonnade -- that Senator Sanders I think is evidently and justifiably proud of all that he\xe2\x80\x99s accomplished. \xc2\xa0And I think he appreciate the President showing him respect by inviting him to the White House and sitting down for an hour-long conversation with him, and giving him the time and space that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for Senator Sanders to make some important decisions about the future of his campaign and the future of the movement that he\xe2\x80\x99s built.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Time and space? \xc2\xa0I mean, it was not much later that the actual endorsement came out. \xc2\xa0I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s not much time and space.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Senator Sanders is going to make his own decisions. \xc2\xa0When I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to time and space, I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to Senator Sanders making his own decisions about the future of his campaign based on his own preferences and based on his own schedule. \xc2\xa0President Obama did the same thing. \xc2\xa0And the good news is, is that both men have a strong commitment to a core set of values and principles, particularly as it relates to the importance of investing in the middle class. \xc2\xa0Both men have a commitment to the principle of grassroots movements and grassroots coalitions, and how our party and our country are stronger when citizens at the grassroots level are engaged in the process of self-government.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd both men have shared the view that the upcoming general election is really important, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that President Obama be succeeded by somebody who has the same kind of commitment to those values that Senator Sanders and President Obama do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In the clip, the President used the term \xe2\x80\x9cfired up\xe2\x80\x9d -- \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fired up,\xe2\x80\x9d which is reminiscent, of course, of his own campaign. \xc2\xa0Does the President see hitting the campaign trail now for Hillary as, in some ways, an extension of his own campaign because in so many ways it will help preserve his legacy? \xc2\xa0I mean, how mindful of that is he?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, this is Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, and President Obama is enthusiastic about doing all that he can to support it. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he said in the video.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That language was deliberate, no?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It was deliberate. \xc2\xa0And I think the President is actually making clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiastic about Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign -- again, not just because she\xe2\x80\x99s got as much -- she\xe2\x80\x99s as qualified as any presidential candidate in American history has been, but because she also has demonstrated, in a variety of circumstances -- difficult circumstances -- the heart, the compassion and the courage to get the job done. \xc2\xa0And the President feels strongly that she\xe2\x80\x99s the right person to succeed him in office. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you tell us anything about this Biden meeting with Sanders today and the speech he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be giving?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I do know is that Vice President Biden has invited Senator Sanders to come to the Naval Observatory, the vice presidential residence, for a meeting around four o\'clock this afternoon where Vice President Biden and Senator Sanders will have an opportunity to have a conversation about Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, about the upcoming general election, and many of the issues that Senator Sanders has been discussing on the campaign trail.</p>\n<p>\n\tVice President Biden is somebody with a political following in his own right. \xc2\xa0He certainly is somebody who would be a valuable surrogate on the campaign trail. \xc2\xa0But once that meeting is concluded, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give Senator Sanders and the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s office the opportunity to discuss any outcome of that meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it a strategy session? \xc2\xa0Would you describe it as that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them describe it once they\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity to talk.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President support getting rid of superdelegates?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not heard the President weigh in with that view. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the Democratic National Committee is responsible for laying out the process of choosing the Democratic presidential nominee. \xc2\xa0I made a reference to this in the briefing the other day -- that every four years or so, there is intense consideration within the Democratic Party about the best way to choose the Democratic nominee. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI happened to work at the DNC in 2004. \xc2\xa0And in 2003, there was an established process with public hearings and reports and Blue Ribbon panels all dedicated to taking a close look at the process of choosing the Democratic nominee for President. \xc2\xa0And there were a number of things that were considered -- everything from the role of superdelegates to the first-in-the-nation status of both Iowa and New Hampshire. \xc2\xa0There was a discussion about whether or not primaries should be organized on a regional basis. \xc2\xa0So there are lots of ideas for ways to change the process of choosing the Democratic nominee. \xc2\xa0I think we would all acknowledge that it\'s rather peculiar process that both parties are engaged in. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think what\'s important, what both Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton acknowledged, is that they knew what the rules were when they signed up. \xc2\xa0They knew exactly what role superdelegates would play in this process. \xc2\xa0But look, if the process wants to engage in another process to consider making changes, that\'s something that party officials should do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you say a little bit about why the first joint campaign will take place in Green Bay? \xc2\xa0Where does that fit within in your strategy going forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, to be clear, that\'s Secretary Clinton\'s strategy, so I think I\'d mostly let her campaign talk about it. \xc2\xa0But I would just observe that President Obama has won two presidential campaigns over the last eight years, and he won the state of Wisconsin both times. \xc2\xa0So he\'s certainly got some influence and a following in Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0So the President has said he appreciates Senator Sanders bringing up the special interest influence in politics. \xc2\xa0Can President Obama do anything about campaign finance reform in his remaining months in office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any executive orders or policy announcements or anything to put forward today. \xc2\xa0The President has put forward a couple of ideas for what would bring greater transparency to our political process. \xc2\xa0The President is obviously an enthusiastic supporter of the DISCLOSE Act. \xc2\xa0This is a proposal that was put forward by Democrats in Congress that would bring much-needed transparency to the financing of political campaigns in the United States. \xc2\xa0For some reason, Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to support that principle. \xc2\xa0The President has in the State of the Union address expressed his concern about the impact of the Citizens United decision on the financing of American elections. \xc2\xa0And it\'s why the President has speculated that what may be necessary is actually a rather painstaking process of amending our Constitution to make clear certain principles about the importance of transparency in our elections and how the American people and our political process would benefit from greater transparency.</p>\n<p>\n\tPeter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When did President Obama first communicate to Secretary Clinton that he would be endorsing her campaign? \xc2\xa0Did it take place in that phone conversation on Tuesday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have details of their conversations to go into. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the President did have an opportunity to make a congratulatory call to Secretary Clinton. \xc2\xa0What\'s also true is that the President\'s political director, David Simas, is somebody who is principally responsible for managing the lines of communication between the White House and the individual campaigns. \xc2\xa0So he certainly played the core role. \xc2\xa0That\'s the role that\'s ascribed for him. \xc2\xa0And he played that role of communicating with both campaigns to ensure that nobody was surprised and that this was reasonably well-organized.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0To be clear, he would have taped it that day? \xc2\xa0So by the time they spoke, the tape would already be in the can, right? \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President did tape the video prior to placing his phone call to President Clinton on Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0For Bernie Sanders supporters who say, hey, all he wanted was to be able to give Americans the choice without President Obama tipping the scales until every American had had a chance to vote, they\'ll say, why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t the guy have just waited until after Tuesday in Washington, D.C? \xc2\xa0What do you say to the Sanders folks who say, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he just give us a few more days?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, I think I\'d say a couple of things. \xc2\xa0The first is, I think this is an indication of President Obama\'s enthusiasm to get engaged in the general election and be supportive of the Democratic nominee. \xc2\xa0The stakes are high. \xc2\xa0We do have a presumptive Democratic nominee based on calculations that have been conducted by your news organization and many others. \xc2\xa0And the President is enthusiastic about Secretary Clinton, based on this own personal relationship with her, but also watching on her in action on the campaign trail and in serving as Secretary of State.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, Senator Sanders said it more authoritatively than I can about how deeply he respected President Obama and Vice President Biden not weighing in and keeping their commitment to allow Democratic voters across the country to make a decision about who should represent our party in the general election. \xc2\xa0And we now know that Secretary Clinton has gotten a majority of delegates that will be voting on the party nominee in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the First Lady traveling with him on Wednesday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that she is, no. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I guess beyond that -- there was one other thing I was going to tell you, but I think I forgot it. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Well, I\'ll come back to you if it occurs to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I think it\'ll be a good one.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay, sounds good. \xc2\xa0Carol.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He yields the balance. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\'ll go to the gentlelady from Pennsylvania, Ms. Lee.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You should feel free to interrupt. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Did the President come away from the Sanders meeting with a commitment or at least the belief that there will not be any confrontation or contested convention?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President came away from his conversation feeling quite good about it. \xc2\xa0Again, I think this was evident from what all of you were able to see from their interaction on the Colonnade. \xc2\xa0And I think, again, I think Senator Sanders said it best out in the driveway here. \xc2\xa0He\'s enormously appreciative of the way that President Obama and Vice President Biden conducted themselves in the context of the primary. \xc2\xa0And Senator Sanders made clear that there are a set of principles and priorities that he\'s going to continue to fight for, including in the context of the general election. \xc2\xa0And I think based on Senator Sanders\'s comments about the Republican nominee, it\'s clear that he understands the stakes in this election. \xc2\xa0President Obama certainly understands the stakes in this election. \xc2\xa0You\'ve heard him talk about that in a number of places, including in Elkhart.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Senator Sanders has earned the right to make his own decisions about his campaign on a timeframe of his choosing. \xc2\xa0But the President came away from the conversation feeling quite good about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On a different topic. \xc2\xa0The other day, your statement of administration policy on the NDAA, the language on the Gitmo provisions was a little stronger than usual, and it said that the President -- that the White House would treat those provisions as consistent with the President\'s constitutional authority. \xc2\xa0Should we interpret that to mean that he will just ignore them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a detailed conversation with our lawyers about that language, so why don\xe2\x80\x99t we take a look at that and we\'ll follow up with you. \xc2\xa0I just want to I just want to make sure I give you a good steer. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI suspect that the language was chosen quite carefully for a reason. \xc2\xa0I just want to make sure I can help you understand that correctly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn, nice to see you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Following up on Carol\xe2\x80\x99s question about the Sanders fight on, he also talks about those issues and principles of fighting for them in Philadelphia, at the convention. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s your understanding of what that means?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Senator Sanders explain it. \xc2\xa0But I think Secretary Clinton has indicated that she believes that those are priorities worth fighting for, as well. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure the Republican nominee has indicated as much.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, I think the case that I have been making for quite some time now, and President Obama has been making for quite some time now, is that the Democratic Party is united around a core set of principles. \xc2\xa0And despite some admittedly significant stylistic differences between the two candidates, their platforms and their priorities are drawn from the same values. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think the same is true of the Republican candidates. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t think the debate that we see on the Republican side of the aisle reflects that, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are even vigorous disputes among Republicans who are currently serving in Congress about the wisdom of a variety of approaches. \xc2\xa0They\'ve indicated some discomfort with some of the policies advocated by the Republican nominee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President has pointed out that there is a pretty stark difference here between our two parties. \xc2\xa0And I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important -- and the real, most important indicator is an acknowledgement of the huge stakes in this general election. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve heard President Obama talk about that at some length, and we heard Senator Sanders talk about that on the driveway just a couple hours ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And also on the driveway he talked about looking forward to meeting with Secretary Clinton, seeing how they could work together to defeat Donald Trump. \xc2\xa0And also on these issues on Philadelphia, about what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen in Philadelphia, is it possible that the President could get involved to try to facilitate these discussions and facilitate some sort of agreements using his auspices and good offices?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, obviously the President knows both Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton well. \xc2\xa0The President has got deep respect for both of them, and I think that respect has been reciprocated in those relationships. \xc2\xa0So the President certainly would be able to play a facilitating role if one is necessary, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll find out if it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis, nice to see you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Nice to see you, too. \xc2\xa0Josh, I have three related questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because we\'ve had presidential cycles where the sitting President has not always been welcomed by the nominee on the campaign trail, I just wanted to ask you: \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiasm, how will he be using his time, say, between now and the convention, in addition to Wisconsin? \xc2\xa0Are we going to see him coordinating constantly with the campaign to develop a schedule both separate and apart from the nominee? \xc2\xa0What does he envision in terms of a commitment of time to help?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me start by saying that the President\xe2\x80\x99s most important job is Commander-in-Chief and President of the United States. \xc2\xa0And over the course of the last year and a half, you\'ve all heard me say on many occasions that the President is determined to squeeze every last drop of opportunity that he can out of the days that are remaining while he\xe2\x80\x99s in office. \xc2\xa0So that will be his number one priority. \xc2\xa0It always has been, and it will be -- even though he\xe2\x80\x99s quite enthusiastic about the Democratic nominee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat being said, when it comes to strategic decisions about the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign schedule, a lot of it is going to be driven by Secretary Clinton and her campaign. \xc2\xa0This is her campaign. \xc2\xa0And President Obama has indicated that he wants to help. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have some advice for Secretary Clinton and potentially maybe even members of her team. \xc2\xa0But they\'re the ones that are making these decisions. \xc2\xa0And the President is quite enthusiastic about what he can do to try to help.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0My second question is related to that. \xc2\xa0Because the teams are so woven together in terms of having served at the White House, having served in previous administrations, and the President joked about, I have advice, maybe they don\'t want to hear it, but I have advice, right -- how is he going to give that advice? \xc2\xa0In other words, has he talked to Secretary Clinton along the way? \xc2\xa0Has he talked to her? \xc2\xa0You said he talked to Sanders three times. \xc2\xa0How often has he been talking to her? \xc2\xa0Is he just going -- does he consider himself an advisor?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, he does not consider himself an advisor. \xc2\xa0But he certainly is somebody who has got a lot of relevant experience, and he\xe2\x80\x99s somebody with a track record of success. \xc2\xa0So presumably, Secretary Clinton and even Senator Sanders, as he completes his campaign, would be interested in President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s advice.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut both Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders have plenty of advisors and plenty of other people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t advisors eager to give them advice. \xc2\xa0So the truth is the President is eager to be helpful, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be helpful in whatever way he can.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How often has he spoken to the former Secretary this week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know of at least one conversation. \xc2\xa0This is the election night conversation when the President congratulated her for getting a sufficient number of delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any conversations to read out. \xc2\xa0You know that they\'ve had an opportunity to meet here at the White House two or three times over the course of the campaign. \xc2\xa0And in part that\'s because they\'re friends, but in part that\'s because they both have a pretty keen interest in the general election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you know whether they will be together? \xc2\xa0She\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be in town tomorrow. \xc2\xa0I just wondered if they\'re going to get together before Wisconsin.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any meetings that are planned for tomorrow, so I don\'t believe they will. \xc2\xa0So I suspect that the next opportunity that the President will have to see Secretary Clinton in person will be in Titletown on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the last question is, some members of the Cabinet have already endorsed Secretary Clinton for nominee, obviously before she became the nominee. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction to members of the Cabinet who may want to continue to be helpful or may want to join now to be helpful in terms of their use of their time, how they see fit politically? \xc2\xa0What is his direction to them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a couple of directives. \xc2\xa0The first is that each of those individuals has a day job that\'s more important than the campaign. \xc2\xa0Each of those Cabinet secretaries is invested with significant responsibilities that has a significant impact on the American people. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ve got total confidence that all those Cabinet secretaries understand that that is their first priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing is that there are rules in place that govern the way that government employees can engage in political activities. \xc2\xa0And the President expects that all of the employees in the federal government, from Cabinet secretaries on down, will be conscientious about following those laws, both the letter and the spirit. \xc2\xa0So that would be his second directive. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut consistent with the rather significant requirements of their day job, and consistent with the laws that govern political activity, the President would leave it to individual Cabinet members to make a decision about how involved they would like to be in the upcoming election.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, in your statement on Tuesday night, you specifically said that Sanders had requested today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, and then just earlier you indicated that his decision to announce the endorsement today might not have been a surprise to Senator Sanders, given the fact that they had spoken earlier this week. \xc2\xa0Would it be right to assume maybe that Senator Sanders may have requested the meeting -- that you hold off on the endorsement until that meeting took place? \xc2\xa0Can you talk a little bit more how that meeting came together?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get into all the details of their conversation, but the President certainly was interested in a conversation with Senator Sanders. \xc2\xa0Senator Sanders did suggest and did request that President Obama make time in his schedule for the two men to get together. \xc2\xa0The President was happy to do that and invited Senator Sanders to come to the White House to have that discussion. \xc2\xa0And the President felt that it was appropriate and respectful to withhold any formal announcement of an endorsement until he\xe2\x80\x99d had an opportunity to sit down with Senator Sanders.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, late on Tuesday night, Senator Sanders was on the West Coast, and President Obama had his own busy travel schedule yesterday, so this morning was the first opportunity that the two men could get together. \xc2\xa0And the President was pleased to have that conversation. \xc2\xa0And Senator Sanders, as he said out in front of the West Wing a couple hours ago, was appreciative of the way that President Obama handled his business.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0To be clear, you\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that Senator Sanders requested that he hold off on an endorsement until they had a chance to meet?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any sort of request like that. \xc2\xa0I think Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s request was merely for an opportunity to sit down with President, and the President was happy to oblige and to arrange a meeting at the White House today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then the Vice President has been a bit freer in commenting about the race, but does this endorsement extend to him as well? \xc2\xa0Or will he make his own separate announcement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s office for any sort of formal endorsement that the Vice President would choose to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the last question is: \xc2\xa0In the video he talks about I think he\xe2\x80\x99s not sure that anybody has been more qualified to be President. \xc2\xa0Is he included himself eight years ago when he said that? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I mean, when you just take a raw look at qualifications, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty obvious. \xc2\xa0She served as Secretary of State for four years. \xc2\xa0She is somebody who has been in the public eye for a couple of decades, including *four eight years as United States senator and eight years as First Lady. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo she is somebody who brings a wide range of experience. \xc2\xa0And I cite her experience as First Lady because she traveled the world, and was, particularly at the end of her tenure, essentially a diplomat for the United States. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard-pressed to come up with a presidential candidate -- with the possible exception of people who had served as Vice President before they ran for President. \xc2\xa0So somebody like --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Richard Nixon.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Richard Nixon or George H.W. Bush, somebody who had served for eight years as Vice President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Al Gore?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Al Gore. \xc2\xa0So you could think of some other candidates who would fill that role. \xc2\xa0But with the exception of sitting Vice Presidents, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard-pressed to come up with a candidate throughout American history who\xe2\x80\x99s got more experience and is more qualified than Secretary Clinton to do this job.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Not to belabor the tick-tock, but just so I\xe2\x80\x99m clear, you mentioned that the President talked with Bernie Sanders three times this week. \xc2\xa0When was the first time that he broached the possibility and prospect that he was going to endorse Secretary Clinton?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the details of the conversations, but obviously he had a conversation on Sunday, a conversation on Tuesday, and then the conversation in the Oval Office today. \xc2\xa0Those were the three conversations that I was referring to. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get into the details of exactly the nature of those conversations in each day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And for today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, what was -- I mean, you mentioned the President has some relevant experience here, given the campaign eight years ago. \xc2\xa0What was his advice to Senator Sanders, if he had any, about how to take the coalition that he\xe2\x80\x99s built throughout the campaign that the President talked about in the video, was impressive and he congratulated him on, and do something with it that would help boost Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy? \xc2\xa0I mean, were there specific things -- are there specific things that the President thinks he needs to do now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think this is the best way that I can describe it to you while also trying to protect their ability to have a private conversation. \xc2\xa0The relevant experience that President Obama has is from 2008, in which he had also run in a competitive Democratic primary contest. \xc2\xa0President Obama came out the winner, but he benefitted enormously from the runner-up -- then-Senator Clinton -- enthusiastically supporting his general election campaign. \xc2\xa0And President Obama was able to speak firsthand how meaningful that was to him personally and to his campaign to have the strong support of then-Senator Clinton for his general election presidential race.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so that\xe2\x80\x99s the perspective that President Obama could share with Senator Sanders. \xc2\xa0Each situation is different, but I think there are some clear parallels here. \xc2\xa0And I think it was beneficial. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Senator Sanders speak for himself, but I suspect it was beneficial for Senator Sanders to hear President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s perspective about how meaningful that endorsement was.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that that endorsement from then-Senator Clinton came after she celebrated the accomplishments of her campaign. \xc2\xa0She gave a big speech here in Washington, D.C. -- I believe it was at the National Building Museum -- where she talked about the 18 million new cracks in the glass ceiling. \xc2\xa0And that was a genuine celebration of the movement and campaign that she had built. \xc2\xa0And the success of that campaign was worthy of enormous respect.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut shortly after that, she traveled with President Obama to New Hampshire and they had an event together where her presence on the stage alongside then-Senator Obama was really important. \xc2\xa0It didn\xe2\x80\x99t change everybody\xe2\x80\x99s mind that day, but it initiated a process where, over the course of the summer and fall, President Obama and Senator Clinton made a persuasive case to her supporters that President Obama was the right choice to succeed President George W. Bush in office.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that then-Senator Clinton announcing her support for Senator Obama\xe2\x80\x99s general election campaign didn\xe2\x80\x99t diminish her status at all. \xc2\xa0I think, if anything, her status as a singular political figure in the Democratic Party and in the country was enhanced. \xc2\xa0And her performance on the campaign trail, both in the primary election where they competed against one another, but also in the general election, where she was giving voice to many of the priorities that were animating President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, were part of the reason that he chose her to be Secretary of State.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, these situations are different. \xc2\xa0The candidates are different. \xc2\xa0The dynamics of the race are different. \xc2\xa0But I think there\xe2\x80\x99s some relevant parallels to be drawn, and hopefully President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s perspective was useful to Senator Sanders as he makes some important decisions about the future of his campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So did he request that Senator Sanders think about -- actually think about endorsing her and doing it quickly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, President Obama was deeply respectful of Senator Sanders. \xc2\xa0And because of the enormous success of his campaign, Senator Sanders is entitled to the time and space that he needs to make that decision on his own. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the timing of the campaign appearance with Senator Clinton -- or Secretary Clinton next week, is it a coincidence that it\xe2\x80\x99s the day after the D.C. primary is over, and it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Senator Sanders to compete in that? \xc2\xa0Or is that something that the President did consciously, knowing that Senator Sanders wants to be able to be a factor in that contest?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0For the decision about the timing, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Clinton campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tLana.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You mentioned a couple times that the President and Senator Sanders seemed to have a fun time when they were walking down the colonnade. \xc2\xa0We saw them laughing, the President even patted him on the back. \xc2\xa0What were they talking about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to him about that aspect of their conversation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the joke was?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It was a funny one, apparently. \xc2\xa0But, look, I think -- I suspect that based on my observation and President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s own experience in having run a vigorous, longer-than-expected Democratic primary campaign, that there\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit of a weight that\xe2\x80\x99s lifted off Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s got some critically important decisions to make. \xc2\xa0But I think he can be profoundly proud of the movement that he\xe2\x80\x99s built and the results that he has to show for it. \xc2\xa0And I think that would put anybody in a good mood.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Donald Trump has been trying to appeal to Sanders supporters by asking them to \xe2\x80\x9cget even with Clinton\xe2\x80\x9d by supporting him. \xc2\xa0How important is Sanders --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s quite a campaign slogan, huh?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yeah.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGet even.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lots of slogans coming out of this campaign. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That will be really inspiring. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How important is Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s concession and the timing of that to trying to keep those Sanders supporters enthusiastic about the Democratic nominee? \xc2\xa0Is Tuesday better than July?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, I\'m not going to backseat drive as Senator Sanders makes these decisions. \xc2\xa0So the unity of the Democratic Party will be important and important to Secretary Clinton\'s success in the general election. \xc2\xa0And in talking about how Secretary Clinton can succeed in winning the support of the 10 million Democrats and independents that supported Senator Sanders in the race, Senator Sanders is going to be an enormously influential voice and advocate to his supporters. \xc2\xa0But ultimately his decision about all this will be up to him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Since it\'s being reported on Tuesday, was the plan always to release the video a couple of hours after the two men met at the Oval Office? \xc2\xa0Or did that meeting have an influence on the timing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The rough timing -- as you could tell by a couple of changes to today\'s briefing schedule, the timing did shift a little bit over the course of the day today. \xc2\xa0So, once again, I appreciate your patience with that. \xc2\xa0But the general timeframe here is something that was well-established.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And my last question is about the attacks in Tel Aviv. \xc2\xa0What does the White House make of Israel\'s decision to suspend entry permits to Palestinians? \xc2\xa0Does the White House find that an appropriate response? \xc2\xa0Is it too similar in some ways to the presumptive Republican nominee\'s proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States because of terrorism?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me start by saying that we offer our condolences to the families of those who are mourning the loss of loved ones in a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv yesterday. \xc2\xa0This is violence against innocent civilians, and it\'s an outrage and something that\'s worthy of widespread condemnation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States continues to stand strongly with our allies in Israel as they confront a very difficult security situation inside their own country. \xc2\xa0So we\'re going to support them and we\'re going to stand by them as they deal with the challenge of securing their country and protecting their citizens. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on the steps that they have taken to try to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tJuliet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In terms of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, I know you reiterated the President\'s support for her. \xc2\xa0Bernie Sanders has been a sharp critic of her leadership of the DNC, and I\'m wondering if you could provide any insights for us as to whether her leadership came up in the context of their conversation or whether there\'s anything you can say to the extent that the President and Bernie Sanders talked about structural changes within the DNC, beyond the platform that could help reflect his efforts to change the way the Democratic Party operates.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have additional details of their conversation to share. \xc2\xa0As I mentioned to James, the President is deeply appreciative of Debbie Wasserman Schultz\'s service as the chair of the DNC. \xc2\xa0And I think her track record, particularly as it relates to the last presidential election, speaks for itself.</p>\n<p>\n\tOver the last several months, Senator Sanders has expressed some frustration and concern about the process of choosing a Democratic presidential nominee. \xc2\xa0And he\'ll have to make his decisions about how best to pursue reforms of that process. \xc2\xa0But look, everybody knew the rules when they signed up, and Senator Sanders has indicated that a desire to change those rules in a way that he believes would make the process more fair. \xc2\xa0And that\'s something that will have to be considered by Democrats across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark, I\'ll give you the last one. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Josh, can you tell us why Senator Sanders arrived at the residence rather than the West Wing? \xc2\xa0Was it just for the photo-opportunity?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Awfully short. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0The Green Bay event on Wednesday, is that a Hillary Clinton campaign event?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0It is a campaign event in support of Secretary Clinton\'s campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do any White House staffers have to go off payroll in setting up the President\'s participation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0Not that I\'m aware of, at least. \xc2\xa0I\'m going to have to jog my memory from the 2010 campaign. \xc2\xa0But there are regulations that govern political activities. \xc2\xa0So there are members of the President\'s staff who can support him as he does his job, and one of those jobs is to be the leader of a political party. \xc2\xa0So there are narrow circumstances in which members of the President\'s staff can assist him and advise him as he undertakes those activities. \xc2\xa0The best example of that is the President\'s political director, David Simas, who has been the principal point of coordination -- again, within the balance of the law -- between the White House and the relevant presidential campaigns.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have you got any White House reaction to the Chinese intercept of the American aircraft, reconnaissance aircraft? \xc2\xa0Is this another one of those incidents where you\'re just going to lodge a complaint through normal military channels?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We certainly will raise our concerns through usual military channels. \xc2\xa0But the Department of Defense has mentioned this directly that, back on June 7th, earlier this week, there were two Chinese jets that intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft that was operating in international airspace. \xc2\xa0The concern is that the Chinese jets conducted that intercept at an unsafe, excessive rate of closure. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe initial assessment from the Department of Defense is that this intercept and its unsafe nature appears to be a case of what the Department of Defense has described as improper airmanship. \xc2\xa0And they arrived at that conclusion because, based on their analysis, there was no other provocative or unsafe maneuvers that were executed. \xc2\xa0So that\'s the analysis of the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo even though it was a case of improper airmanship and not otherwise provocative, we still do raise these concerns with Chinese officials, because again, U.S. aircraft was operating in international waters, consistent with international law and consistent with the principle that the President and Secretary of Defense have articulated on a number of occasions, which is that the United States will operate, fly and sail anywhere that international law allows. \xc2\xa0That\'s just what our aircraft was doing on June 7th.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that mean the administration does not believe China was trying to send any message to the U.S. with this intercept?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think in this case the assessment from the Department of Defense is that this was a case of improper airmanship and that there were no other provocative maneuvers that occurred.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one last issue. \xc2\xa0Besides that of a proud parent, will President Obama be playing any role at his daughter\'s commencement, graduation tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You have adequately summarized the President\'s entire role in tomorrow\'s ceremony. \xc2\xa0So he will be there to see his first-born cross the stage and receive her diploma. \xc2\xa0And he and the First Lady are enormously proud of their daughter\'s accomplishments.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you know if he was asked to speak?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he was asked to speak. \xc2\xa0But if he were, he would decline. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because he\'s going to be too overwrought with emotion to him hear it say it again and again?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President has had an opportunity to give three commencement addresses this year, and this is an opportunity for him to not play the role of commencement speaker but rather to play the role of proud parent, as you described it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it bittersweet? \xc2\xa0Can you address what he asked?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President talked about this a little bit with Mr. Fallon on "The Tonight Show" that will air tonight as well. \xc2\xa0And I think for every parent there\'s a sense that they\'re enormously proud of their child, pleased to see that they\'ve grown up healthy and successful, but also -- yeah, it\'s a little bittersweet to see your child grow up. \xc2\xa0My son is only two and there are sometimes when I feel myself a little bittersweet about his growth.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you turn down Walker\'s high school? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0Before I go, I also want to acknowledge that today is actually the last day of Frank Benenati in my office. \xc2\xa0So many of you have worked with Frank for quite some time now. \xc2\xa0Frank has been a loyal member of the President\'s team for quite a while in a variety of different roles, including on the President\'s reelection campaign, including at the Office of Management and Budget. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFortunately, Frank is not going far. \xc2\xa0He\'s going to go and take a senior position over at the EPA. \xc2\xa0So, many of you may have an opportunity to be in touch with him over there. \xc2\xa0But just at the end of the briefing I wanted to take a minute to acknowledge Frank and his professionalism and his service to the President, to the country. \xc2\xa0And we\'re deeply appreciative for it, and we\'re going to miss you. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0So with that, thank you, guys. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI assume the applause -- let the transcript reflect that the applause was for Frank, not for me. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The applause was completely inaudible. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0 Maybe. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0In spite of that, I\'ll be back tomorrow. \xc2\xa0I\'ll see you then. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t3:40 P.M.
