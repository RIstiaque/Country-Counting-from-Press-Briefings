Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:13 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of conflicting information coming out of Algeria today.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can tell us what the status is of the Americans that had been held hostage.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is our understanding that there are Americans involved, but I would say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, we condemn in the strongest terms a terrorist attack on BP personnel and facilities in Algeria, and we are closely monitoring the situation.\xc2\xa0 We are in contact with Algerian authorities and our international partners, as well as with BP\xe2\x80\x99s security office in London.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the best information we have at this time, as I said, indicates that U.S. citizens are among the hostages.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t have at this point more details to provide to you.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly concerned about reports of loss of life and are seeking clarity from the government of Algeria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at this point you can\xe2\x80\x99t say whether those Americans are alive or dead?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just can only say that we are deeply concerned about any loss of innocent life and are seeking clarity from the government of Algeria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The U.S. obviously has helped other countries with hostage rescue missions, just last week, with the French in Somalia.\xc2\xa0 Did the U.S. offer to assist the Algerians in this mission?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can say that we\xe2\x80\x99re in contact with Algerian authorities and our international partners.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more on that context for you.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is a situation, as you know, that involved a BP facility with, as we understand it, personnel from a variety of different countries.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in those conversations with the Algerians, has there been discussion about what role the U.S. could play?\xc2\xa0 Any offers of assistance?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 But I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have details to provide on those conversations.\xc2\xa0 This is an ongoing situation and we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking clarity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just quickly on the President\xe2\x80\x99s gun violence proposals from yesterday, he said he would put the full weight of the office behind efforts to push for those measures, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what that actually means.\xc2\xa0 Will we see him travel?\xc2\xa0 Will we see him get OFA involved?\xc2\xa0 There was obviously an email from Messina today on this.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as you saw, that email went out, and I think that the President meant what he said.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a schedule of events for you, a schedule of actions or a strategy to lay out to you.\xc2\xa0 But the President absolutely meant what he said, that he is going to put the weight of his office behind this effort.\xc2\xa0 He also meant what he said when he acknowledged that achieving these proposals will be difficult.\xc2\xa0 If having an assault weapons ban become law again were easy it would never have expired.\xc2\xa0 If the variety of other actions that the President proposes we take as a nation were without conflict we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be having this discussion.</p>\n<p>So he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear that it requires everyone coming together, including people who have not traditionally supported the idea of taking further action to reduce gun violence or some of these ideas.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already heard a number of voices, from both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party of individuals who\xe2\x80\x99ve said they are looking at this problem in a new way because of what happened in Newtown, and that\xe2\x80\x99s very important to this process.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s also very important, as the President said, that the American public speak out, because we cannot achieve this if the American people don\xe2\x80\x99t demand it.\xc2\xa0 And so, as I think I mentioned earlier in the week, you can fully expect that as part of this effort we will continue to try to engage the American people and have their voices heard and their concerns heard and their demands heard when it comes to taking common-sense action to reduce gun violence in America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at this point, no specifics about what that actually entails?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- I mean, again, he just made this announcement yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He has a piece of business to take care of on Monday, and a whole host of other matters.\xc2\xa0 But this is a priority, as I think he made very clear yesterday, and there will be more to come.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, going back to Algeria, was the Algerian government in touch with the United States before the raid?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can simply say that it\xe2\x80\x99s premature to get into these types of questions.\xc2\xa0 Right now our priority is determining the status of the Americans involved and gaining a full understanding of what took place.\xc2\xa0 As I said to Julie, this is a fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 We are seeking clarity from the Algerian government about this matter, and obviously, we are focused most intently on the status of Americans.\xc2\xa0 We are in conversations with -- consultation with the Algerian government, but I just don\'t have any more details for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, you said that you were in consultations.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just curious if you were in consultations before the raid.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just don\'t have any more details for you on that.\xc2\xa0 This is a fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t want to say something that turned out not to be true, so I\'ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the U.S. assessment of --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jackie got that -- I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the U.S. assessment of al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s link to this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We certainly heard reports of people taking responsibility, claims -- making claims of responsibility for this terrorist attack, but we have not been able to, thus far, confirm those claims.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is that something that the U.S. is involved in, in trying to figure that out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Certainly.\xc2\xa0 As a broad matter, we\'re obviously very interested in and focused on terrorist groups and terrorist actions in the region and around the world, and so trying to find out who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for something like this is something we are endeavoring to do.\xc2\xa0 But we just have not -- I don\'t have information now that allows me to confirm or rebut those reports.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said earlier in the week that the United States would consider providing logistical support to France and Mali.\xc2\xa0 How does this development affect that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not sure that it does.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we share the goal -- the French goal of denying terrorists in Mali a safe haven, denying terrorists in the region a safe haven, and we\xe2\x80\x99d note that the government of Mali has asked for French support in their fight against AQIM.</p>\n<p>As you know, the government of France has asked for some additional intelligence and logistic support from the United States and, as I said the other day, we\'re considering those requests.\xc2\xa0 We have some unique airlift capability and we are working with the French to provide them support in moving troops and equipment.\xc2\xa0 As we\'ve said previously, we are also providing intelligence support.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, just briefly on one other topic.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the President has an event on Monday.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any color about how he\xe2\x80\x99s preparing for his speech, and any little tidbits about what he might say?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no preview of his remarks.\xc2\xa0 The President I think is very appreciative of the fact that the American people have given him this opportunity to deliver a second inaugural address.\xc2\xa0 He, as you know, takes very seriously speeches of this kind and is very engaged in the process.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s working on his remarks.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any details for you.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing we really want to turn over to him for Monday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that open coverage on Monday?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what do you say to the local officials, including the governor of Mississippi, who are suggesting that if you succeed in getting new laws passed they won\'t enforce them on the gun issue?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see those particular remarks, John.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of actions that the President has proposed.\xc2\xa0 Some of them are executive actions.\xc2\xa0 Some of the most important of them, as the President made clear, require congressional action.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to lawyers to sort out, if we are fortunate enough to achieve these pieces of legislation, how those laws would be enforced.</p>\n<p>But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear here.\xc2\xa0 There is nothing the President proposed yesterday that would result, if enacted, in anyone -- any law-abiding citizen in America losing a gun.\xc2\xa0 The President made clear yesterday his full support for the Second Amendment and the Second Amendment rights of American citizens.\xc2\xa0 He also made clear that we have an obligation, and American citizens, including our most vulnerable, youngest American citizens, have rights, too.\xc2\xa0 And we have an obligation to uphold those rights, including the rights of seven-year-olds to live without the fear of being gunned down in their own school.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we as a society need to come together and take common-sense actions that do not affect Americans\xe2\x80\x99 Second Amendment rights, which the President supports, but do put in place laws and actions that address this problem; that, for example, provide for a system of background checks for those who would purchase weapons that is comprehensive, that does not contain gaping loopholes.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that a vast majority of the American people believe is sensible and they support.\xc2\xa0 And the President sincerely hopes that that support, which comes from around the country, that comes from Democrats and Republicans, that comes from NRA members, sportsmen and women, from suburban areas, rural areas and urban areas, will result in Congress taking appropriate action.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what happens to the, by some estimates, 2 million assault-style weapons that are out there now and more?\xc2\xa0 What happens to those after a ban?\xc2\xa0 Is this a ban on --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the old ones are grandfathered in?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a ban on\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, this is a ban on further manufacture, on new weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how effective can something like that be, given that the -- I mean, look at the sales that are going on even now.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President said that there is no question -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s no single piece of legislation, no single action that we can take that would eradicate all acts of evil, all acts of violence, that would absolutely prevent every terrible shooting in the future.\xc2\xa0 We know that, and the President is aware of that.\xc2\xa0 But we should take actions that reduce the possibility; that through the reduction in the possibility of the kinds of things we saw in Newtown and Aurora and Columbine and elsewhere, lives are saved.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we can\xe2\x80\x99t let the perfect be the enemy of the good here.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t let the fact that there will of course continue to be gun violence in America prevent us from taking actions to reduce gun violence in America, taking actions to make sure that we are doing everything we can to live up to our first obligation, which is to protect our children.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no single action here that solves this problem.\xc2\xa0 Even this collection of actions won\xe2\x80\x99t solve the problem.\xc2\xa0 But it will, the President believes, reduce gun violence, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a worthy goal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with the high-capacity magazines, the same thing holds true, that that would just prevent -- ban the manufacture of new --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding.\xc2\xa0 I think we provided a bunch of fact sheets and stuff yesterday on the details, but that is my understanding.\xc2\xa0 But I would encourage you to look at the stuff that the policy people put together and provided to you yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just two questions on how you go about getting this passed -- the obvious uphill battle you face in Congress -- one, that the grassroots campaign Robert Gibbs is suggesting, that the great campaign apparatus that helped the President win reelection should now be activated full force on this.\xc2\xa0 Will it be?\xc2\xa0 And will the President be reaching out personally to -- that there are 11 Democrats in the Senate with either an A or B rating to the NRA.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be talking individually to each of those Democratic senators?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you can expect the President to be engaged with members of Congress, including Democratic senators.\xc2\xa0 I think as you saw in the wake of Newtown, the President actually spoke with some Democratic senators about this issue, including Senator Manchin of West Virginia.\xc2\xa0 Those conversations will continue.</p>\n<p>And I have no specific announcement to make about next steps in this effort.\xc2\xa0 But you can be sure that the President will use the power of his office to try to bring about fulfillment of these proposals, because he thinks they\'re the right things to do, and he thinks that we as a nation need to move forward, and that we can take steps that help reduce gun violence in this country and help protect our children, including our youngest children.</p>\n<p>I\'ll move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Jackie.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you just expand a little more on the Inaugural on Sunday?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it sounds like it\'s going to be just family.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can try.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you say exactly who is going to be there; that it will be no advisors or -- and why that is?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s a small room, and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you could choose another room.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\'s -- this is the official swearing-in, as called for by the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 And the Chief Justice will swear in the President.\xc2\xa0 I gave some details.\xc2\xa0 I think we corrected about the Bible that will be used on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 It will be family.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a list of names for which family members will be there.\xc2\xa0 There will be a full press pool there.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a pretty large group, with a lot of equipment.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll be there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it will be more presumably than just Mrs. Obama and the daughters and the President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe there will be some family members, but I don\'t have -- I\'ll see if I have -- if I can get information on which additional members will be there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then at the dinner affair afterwards, who would be involved?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, which affair?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Sunday, after the private swearing-in.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to check on that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a series of events, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure which one you\'re referring to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, just what he will be --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\'s he going to do after he\'s sworn in?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- participating in immediately after he\'s sworn in.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll try to find out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There have been several news reports about an incident in Syria.\xc2\xa0 December 23rd, six people died from some sort of gas attack.\xc2\xa0 Several people on the ground seem to believe that it was a chemical agent.\xc2\xa0 The State Department did a couple of investigations.\xc2\xa0 They couldn\'t corroborate that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the White House put out a statement saying only that it didn\'t match what you know about Syria\'s chemical weapons program.\xc2\xa0 They didn\'t say what you think happened that day.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m also wondering, are you 100 percent sure that no chemical weapons have been used in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The State Department addressed this issue yesterday.\xc2\xa0 One of our diplomatic posts received anecdotal information from a third party regarding an alleged incident in Syria in December.\xc2\xa0 Per normal procedure, this information was relayed to the State Department in Washington.\xc2\xa0 We looked into these allegations at the time we received the information, and found no credible evidence to corroborate or confirm that chemical weapons were used.</p>\n<p>We continue to closely monitor Syria\'s proliferation of sensitive materials and facilities, and have been consistent and clear about our red lines regarding chemical weapons in Syria.\xc2\xa0 As the President said, if the Assad regime makes the tragic mistake of using chemical weapons or fails to meet its obligation to secure them, they will be held accountable.\xc2\xa0 In other words, we received third-party information.\xc2\xa0 We checked it out and found no credible evidence to corroborate or confirm it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of course, the problem is that this evidence is unattainable inside Homs.\xc2\xa0 And use of chemical agents is notoriously hard to verify.\xc2\xa0 What is your level of confidence that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we found no credible evidence, and the fact that a third party provided this anecdotal information led to us checking it out appropriately, and we found no credible information that would confirm it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But your question is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is your level of confidence that if a chemical agent was used, that you would be able to tell?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'m not able from here to discuss the procedures by which we evaluate these kinds of things.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that we found no credible evidence, and we are -- we remain, as we have been throughout, vigilant about this issue and very clear with the Assad regime about our red lines.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Algeria, can you just talk about the President\'s level of involvement in this?\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t catch that earlier, in terms of -- has he been working the phones?\xc2\xa0 Is he being briefed regularly since so many Americans are involved?\xc2\xa0 What is the President\'s level of engagement?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has been updated regularly by his national security team on this matter.\xc2\xa0 As you would expect, I have no other details for you, no calls to read out.\xc2\xa0 But we are, as an administration, in contact with the Algerian government and seeking clarity about the events that have been reported.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a variety of conflicting reports about the events there.\xc2\xa0 So we are in communication with the Algerian government, and the President is being regularly updated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of State yesterday spoke to the head of their government, I believe, but there\xe2\x80\x99s been no calls between the President and --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no calls of the President to read out to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Following on John about guns, when the President has traveled on other issues like payroll tax cut or other things to engage the American public, as you say, he\xe2\x80\x99s mostly been pressuring the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 How -- as you mentioned after Newtown, he spoke to Senator Manchin, and at that time in December, Senator Manchin was suggesting he was open to the idea of an assault weapons ban.\xc2\xa0 This past weekend he seemed to suggest he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Al Franken, who is a more liberal Democrat, kind of hesitated about whether he supported the assault weapons ban; today he says he supports the principle of it -- not making clear he supports the bill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>My question is:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve pressured Republicans before; what is going to do different this time to convince his fellow Democrats who are the swing votes here that this is the right thing to do?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been very clear about this as recently as yesterday, which he believes we all need to reflect upon the problem, examine our consciences, and decide what the right course of action is, and decide whether or not common-sense measures that help protect our most vulnerable citizens, our children, from gun violence are the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He firmly believes they are, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be having that conversation with Republicans and Democrats and with Americans more broadly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some change in the atmosphere around this issue since the tragedy in Newtown, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some gun rights supporters who haven\'t abandoned their support for gun rights, just as the President has not, but who view this issue now in a different way and believe that common-sense action is the right way to go.\xc2\xa0 And the President hopes to build on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But he made very clear yesterday that he understands that this is a challenge.\xc2\xa0 These things aren\'t law -- at least the things that he\xe2\x80\x99s proposed Congress pass -- because they\xe2\x80\x99re hard.\xc2\xa0 If they weren\xe2\x80\x99t, they would be law.\xc2\xa0 And he will work with members of both parties to try to get them passed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when you repeat today the full weight of the presidency -- yesterday I went back to the transcript and the word \xe2\x80\x9cHollywood\xe2\x80\x9d was never used by the President or the Vice President in remarks yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, guns are a big part here, but why not also take on Hollywood?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s taking on the NRA.\xc2\xa0 If this is the full weight of the presidency, why not take on --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s directed as part of the actions he took that the CDC study gun violence and causes of gun violence.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- ignorance is not an acceptable position to adopt, that it\xe2\x80\x99s better not to know.\xc2\xa0 We need to know and it\xe2\x80\x99s worth studying, and we should embrace the science and allow the research to go forward so we can learn more about the effect of violence in the entertainment industry -- depicted through entertainment -- and the impact it may or may not have on society and on children.</p>\n<p>So that was a very specific item that he did include as part of his package.\xc2\xa0 And I think generally, the proposals the President put forward yesterday were recognized as fairly substantive and comprehensive, and that\'s one of them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very last thing, on the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 Republicans like Pat Toomey have suggested that you should prioritize what debts you pay off so that things like Social Security get paid\xc2\xa0 -- payments.\xc2\xa0 As the President said in his press conference last week, he wants them to be paid; wants to make sure people don\'t lose their benefits.\xc2\xa0 Why not prioritize those payments?\xc2\xa0 I just want to give you a chance to respond to the Republican plan that\'s out there.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a specific plan; there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody talking about it.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s be real here.\xc2\xa0 There is no off-ramp.\xc2\xa0 There is no way to mitigate the horrific economic consequences of default.\xc2\xa0 Choosing whether you pay Social Security beneficiaries or combat troops in Afghanistan, or veterans who depend on the VA for benefits, or bondholders -- these are choices that are about default.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the fact is default is not an acceptable option here.\xc2\xa0 Congress has to simply do its job and pay the bills that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already racked up, meet the obligations that they have already made.\xc2\xa0 And then we continue to debate how we move forward to reduce our deficit in a balanced way, how we move forward to get our health care spending under control and reform our tax system.\xc2\xa0 But we cannot play chicken with the full faith and credit of the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have seen in recent days and weeks a number of Republicans and a number of interest groups allied with Republicans make clear their position that flirting with default is a disastrous idea, it is a terrible idea.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly agree with that.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it now from a number of places, and the President has made clear he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to negotiate over raising the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 It is an obligation that Congress retains for itself.\xc2\xa0 If it feels it can\'t handle it, we would happily, as the President said, take that obligation on to the executive branch.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we have to pay our bills.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re the United States of America; we are not a third-tier economy that goes month to month or every half year and casting doubt on whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re going to meet our obligations.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not who we are.</p>\n<p>Major, then Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you noted, Jay, the situation in Algeria is very fluid and you are trying to discern fact from fiction.\xc2\xa0 Once that process is finished, does the President intend to communicate with the country about what he knows and what has happened?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I have no scheduling announcements to make on behalf of the President, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99re focused now on finding out and seeking clarity about the events in Algeria.\xc2\xa0 And once we know more and once we have more that we can convey to you, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make assessments based on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that there is something at work in Mali or Algeria that is moving or shifting in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s maybe catching the American public\xe2\x80\x99s attention for the first time?\xc2\xa0 Threat patterns?\xc2\xa0 Different areas of conflict?\xc2\xa0 An aggressiveness on al Qaeda or affiliates that needs perhaps more communication with the American public, a greater sense of what\xe2\x80\x99s actually going on here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We here in the White House and throughout the administration are intensely focused on al Qaeda and its affiliates.\xc2\xa0 I think that has been made abundantly clear by the actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken, and that continues to be the case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We work with our allies to counter the activities of AQIM; and clearly, AQIM and affiliated extremist groups do pose a threat to our interests in that region, even if they have not posed a direct threat to the homeland, like al Qaeda central in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.</p>\n<p>But this is something -- this is a multi-headed beast, if you will, and we are vigorous in our efforts to combat organizations like this and work with our allies to do so around the region and the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the question of gun legislation, it was made clear to us in the briefing yesterday that the White House will not send a comprehensive bill that contains all of gun control measures to Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 It will defer to, in the case of the assault weapons ban and magazine size, Senator Feinstein, Senator Schumer on one aspect of it; Senator Gillibrand to another.\xc2\xa0 And there are some House Democrats who would prefer just the opposite approach -- a comprehensive bill, one vote, one package to concentrate the mind of the American public and to achieve a better legislative result.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain to us the strategic insight the White House has as to why it\xe2\x80\x99s better that the White House not to write it and send it up in one comprehensive bill?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d answer it two ways.\xc2\xa0 One, some of the legislation that we are talking about here, specifically the legislation that has to do with the assault weapons and with high-capacity ammunition clips preexisted, and Senator Feinstein has done a lot of work on these issues and is working, and we are working with her to develop updated legislation that addresses these matters.\xc2\xa0 And so that -- we believe that\'s the appropriate way to go.</p>\n<p>How this plays out legislatively is obviously hard to know, and I would point you to experts on the Hill about how it will in both the Senate and the House.\xc2\xa0 Our interest is in moving this entire package in a way that is most successful.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously depend in part for our decisions about strategy on our allies in Congress and how they see the best direction to move.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it is an organic White House decision not to send a piece of legislation it drafts in one big package, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing that.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that -- I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason here, which is that the assault weapons ban did exist, was on the books for 10 years, including a portion of it that dealt with ammunition clips.\xc2\xa0 That legislation has been something -- renewal of it is something the President has supported for a long time.\xc2\xa0 And Senator Feinstein is the author of that bill, and we support efforts to update it and move it forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does this strategy reflect a fear that if you put everything in there with the assault weapons ban, that could pull it down and that you have a better chance of achieving some of these other goals if they\xe2\x80\x99re adjudicated, if you will, in Congress separately?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to that directly.\xc2\xa0 I just know that we are working with Senator Feinstein, working with other Senators in the Senate, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll work with House members to try to move something forward here.\xc2\xa0 The reality is, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, that none of this is going to be easy.\xc2\xa0 But the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t try.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- some of it easier in isolation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a question about legislative tactics that you can address to Congress, members of Congress, and that I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed here.\xc2\xa0 We are pursuing a course here that includes the legislation that Senator Feinstein is working on, other legislation -- you mentioned Senator Schumer.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to press the entire agenda the President put forward.</p>\n<p>Ari.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I did say Alexis, and then Ari.\xc2\xa0 Getting the \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9ds here -- then Alexander.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick follow-ups.\xc2\xa0 On Ed\xe2\x80\x99s question:\xc2\xa0 If Congress today -- since we\xe2\x80\x99ve already gone over the debt ceiling -- if Congress today wanted to legislate on this, I\xe2\x80\x99m confused about\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are they even here?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, in a hypothetical, perfect world, if they were going to do this today, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I understand whether the President has signaled how long a duration he\xe2\x80\x99s seeking, what dollar amount for the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 How would they act if he\xe2\x80\x99s not negotiating and he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t suggested what it is he\xe2\x80\x99d sign?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, there is a long tradition here of Congress acting to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 This is a power that they\xe2\x80\x99ve brought -- that they\xe2\x80\x99ve given themselves to do.\xc2\xa0 And the point is -- without drama and delay.\xc2\xa0 A monthly extension is drama, okay?\xc2\xa0 Congress should simply do its job.\xc2\xa0 It should not -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to negotiate over extending the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is the President saying he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to revisit this within a year?\xc2\xa0 Would he like five years?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what is he saying?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President made clear the other day that he would happily take on the responsibility himself if Congress can\xe2\x80\x99t handle it.\xc2\xa0 So the fact is, Congress should simply extend the debt ceiling, and do so in a manner that causes no concern to the economy and to global markets, that does not in any way suggest that Washington is about to engage in another process that results in a self-inflicted wound to the economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a moot point because it should just be extended in a way that does not raise concern about whether or not the United States of America pays its bills.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Another follow-up to what Major was saying.\xc2\xa0 Legislative strategy on guns:\xc2\xa0 The President obviously tasked Vice President Biden to do this.\xc2\xa0 Is Vice President Biden going to be the White House lobbyist on guns on the Hill?\xc2\xa0 And then, secondarily, it\xe2\x80\x99s been reported that the President\xe2\x80\x99s White House lobbyist, Rob Nabors, is going to be elevated to be Deputy Chief of Staff.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, do lawmakers and staffers, are they going to learn soon who the contact person is for the legislative affairs if strategy is so important?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me take the end of your question first by saying that I have no personnel announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Secondly, you can fully expect the Vice President to be engaged in this process.\xc2\xa0 It makes sense since he led the effort that produced the recommendations that led to the President\xe2\x80\x99s event yesterday and the proposals he put forward, and the Vice President has a long history on these matters.\xc2\xa0 He was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 He was a primary author of the Crime Bill that included the assault weapons ban in 1994.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be engaged in these issues.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a roster of individuals who will make up the legislative team, but you can absolutely report with great certainty that the Vice President will be involved.</p>\n<p>Ari.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just like to try to take another crack at the inauguration questions, since this may be the last briefing of the President\xe2\x80\x99s first term.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been so busy the last few weeks with the fiscal cliff and with guns.\xc2\xa0 Have you seen any moments of introspection you could share with us about reaching the end of this momentous term and beginning a new one?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That you can share with us?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you can share -- that was the key phrase.\xc2\xa0 And will this be the last briefing of the first term?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The important question first.\xc2\xa0 What moments of introspection --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Somebody voted over here and said yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I think the President takes, obviously, this responsibility enormously seriously, and feels grateful for the opportunity that the American people have given him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- he said I think in the wake of the election that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get -- he didn\'t seek reelection just to be reelected.\xc2\xa0 He believes that we have work to do, and he believes that both the agenda he has put forward so far and the agenda he will put forward in the future will help this country move forward in a variety of ways.\xc2\xa0 This is something he feels very deeply.</p>\n<p>I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been reported and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the reelection was in some ways for all of us here a humbling experience because it was an assertion by the electorate that said, despite how hard the last four years have been on this country because of the grave economic crisis that we were in when the President took office, the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken have been the right steps and more work needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 And I know he views it that way.</p>\n<p>As far as -- all I can tell you is the President in general when he works on a speech writes in longhand on a yellow pad, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some yellow pads filled with writing of late around, but I don\'t have any more details on the speech.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions following up first on what you said about weapons.\xc2\xa0 You said this is a ban on further manufacture on future weapons.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious what that means for weapons that already have been manufactured and exist in the stocks of retailers around this country, and why that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t motivate manufacturers now to manufacture them in bulk and then store them up if they have the ability to distribute them after.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question.\xc2\xa0 I think the original assault weapons ban was on future manufacture, and I think Senator Feinstein and others can speak with you about the writing of the legislation and some of the reasoning behind that.\xc2\xa0 Again, we do not believe that any single measure that Congress can turn into law or that the President can take, or that even we as a nation can do, will eliminate this problem, will assure us that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be another terrible mass shooting in the future.\xc2\xa0 But these actions -- if we take them -- will, the President believes, reduce the possibility and therefore save lives and that\'s why they\'re so important to take.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then following up perhaps on what Ari said a second ago -- as opposed to the introspective moments about the past four years in this place, I\xe2\x80\x99m curious the President\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts as we now head into this weekend, given the fact that four years ago they were approaching 2 million people expected here; this time, maybe 800,000 per the estimates.\xc2\xa0 There were 10 inaugural balls; this time, just a couple.\xc2\xa0 How does he view this moment differently than he did four years ago as a sort of milestone moment in his presidency?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I don\'t really have anything more for you on his perspective.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll provide that when he speaks on Monday.\xc2\xa0 I would suggest to you that there will be a very good crowd on Monday.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to PIC, the inaugural committee, to explain to you that the number of balls does not -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not an exact coefficient between the number of people going to the balls.\xc2\xa0 But there was, we felt I think, and the President felt and the committee felt that this appropriate in terms of the number of events and the participants in them.</p>\n<p>Stephen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a general matter when American hostages are in a situation overseas, would the government expect or hope to be informed in advance before some kind of rescue operation or attack on the hostage takers?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a very clever way of asking a question that has already been asked.\xc2\xa0 And I just don\'t have -- as it relates to the situation in Algeria, I just don\'t have more information for you at this time.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly try to get you more information as we have it and as we have in a way that we believe is verifiable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, can I try one on Iran?\xc2\xa0 How did the White House interpret President Ahmadinejad\xe2\x80\x99s remarks yesterday that he would have to transform the Iranian economy because of the impact of Western sanctions?\xc2\xa0 Does that augur any hope for any flexibility in the Iranian position, do you think?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at it that way.\xc2\xa0 I would say that it is another indicator, of which there have been many in recent weeks, months and the past year, that the comprehensive international, multinational effort to sanction Iran has been effective in the sense that it has had a profound impact on the Iranian economy and has had an impact, because of that, on the internal political situation in Iran.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Iran is paying a high price for its refusal to abide by its obligations under United Nations Security Council resolutions and will continue to pay a high price.\xc2\xa0 There is a different path available to Iran, a path that would allow it to rejoin the community of nations, to alleviate the burdens placed on it by all these sanctions.\xc2\xa0 They simply have to in a verifiable way abide by their commitments to forsake their nuclear weapons ambitions and to do so in a way that the United States and our broad international consensus here believes is verifiable.</p>\n<p>Donovan -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Brianna.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know it\xe2\x80\x99s like you were right in there with that lovely --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fluorescent --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, fluorescent jacket.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been widely reported that Denis McDonough will likely be announced as the President\xe2\x80\x99s next Chief of Staff.\xc2\xa0 Is that true -- no I\xe2\x80\x99m just kidding.\xc2\xa0 Not is that true.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how sensitive is the President to what appearances might look like if his next personnel announcement is a white man, instead of a pick who might add more diversity to his staff or his Cabinet?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to answer that question since I have no information for you today that would allow you to deduce anything about what the next personnel announcement will be because I have none today, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect one today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a determining factor as he considers --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is considering a variety of personnel decisions carefully and will make announcements when he\xe2\x80\x99s made the decision.\xc2\xa0 And I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of reporting and has been in the past that is speculative in nature, that sometimes proves to be -- it\xe2\x80\x99s like a -- rolling the dice, right?\xc2\xa0 Sometimes if you say it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be three, it turns out to be three, but often it\xe2\x80\x99s not.</p>\n<p>So the fact that some of that reporting about who is going to have which position or be named to which position turns out to be true, there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole bunch of reporting that people forget where reporters assert that so and so is going to get this job and it turns out not to be the case; and so and so gets another job, and it turns out not to be the case -- which is not to cast dispersions.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just simply to say the President hasn\'t made a decision that he\'s ready to announce on that post or any of the others that he has yet to announce.\xc2\xa0 And when he does, he\'ll present them to you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the broader issue about the makeup of his Cabinet and White House staff, I think the President addressed this pretty directly in answer to Jackie just the other day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is he sensitive to the criticism?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would make your assessment on that by looking at the answer he gave, which is that diversity matters to him.\xc2\xa0 That is in part why a woman was his chief diplomat, a woman has been his homeland -- top homeland security Cabinet official, a woman has been representing --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said those were the announcements to judge by all of his announcements.\xc2\xa0 So obviously --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, but that\xe2\x80\x99s in the future.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m just saying -- I mean, I think his record is pretty -- demonstrates the value he places on diversity.\xc2\xa0 And I think he made clear that you should wait to make judgments about his personnel decisions and the diversity of them after he\'s made them and announced them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then after he makes some more personnel assessments -- or personnel announcements, he makes his next one, then after that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he said to all of them.\xc2\xa0 So I would -- I mean, obviously, you\'re free to make any assessments you want at any time that you want, but I think his -- he was urging folks to sort of stand back and wait until he\'s made what will be another series of announcements, because obviously there are some positions to fill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, it\'s the First Lady\'s birthday today, I believe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us anything about how the President and First Family are celebrating her birthday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to ruin the surprise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But anything that may have already happened?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, you know, I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s not waiting until the very end of the day to acknowledge --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a personal thing.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything for that on you -- on that for you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Seriously, I asked, but I don\'t have anything for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any outing tonight?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Outing tonight?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything for you on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.</p>\n<p>Donovan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 On Manti Te\xe2\x80\x99o -- (laughter) -- have you spoken -- someone had to ask.\xc2\xa0 Have you spoken with the President about it and has he had any thoughts about it?\xc2\xa0 I know he\xe2\x80\x99s a big sports fan.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not spoken with him.\xc2\xa0 I read the article in question yesterday evening and it was fascinating.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have anything for you from the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you have thoughts on it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I just thought it was a very interesting story.\xc2\xa0 But I just don\'t, obviously, have any comment on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, secondly, on Algeria -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 On Algeria, Sky News is reporting that U.S. drones, at least one, have been spotted over the area.\xc2\xa0 When you said earlier that we are providing logistical support, does that include drones?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was referring to Mali when I was talking about logistical support to the French effort, which is essentially airlift support.\xc2\xa0 But I mean, I just don\'t have any --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And U.S. drones over Algeria?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any other details for you on the support we\'re providing beyond what I said before.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This may sound very mundane, but the Vice President is meeting with mayors this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m just wondering --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s important.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, so I just wanted to try to put some meat on the bone.\xc2\xa0 Is there any specific asks of the mayors or anything specific that he needs to tell them from the administration on some of these big issues that we\'re dealing with this week, both guns and the debt ceiling?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you can expect that the Vice President will, in his discussion with mayors, raise the issue that he worked hard on and the President announced yesterday, which is a series of initiatives and proposals that make up the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan to try to reduce gun violence.\xc2\xa0 I think that will be a focus of the conversation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\'t know that they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 I suppose that\'s possible, but I think gun violence will be a topic of, and an appropriate one, when the Vice President meets with mayors.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s he asking them for?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Support.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he want mayors to call their congressmen and ask them --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I think the whole point that the President made and the Vice President will make is that we need everybody who believes this is a matter of concern and it needs to be addressed, and who supports the common-sense measures the President put forward yesterday, to speak up.\xc2\xa0 And that includes elected officials at the local level and the state level, as well as at the national level.\xc2\xa0 And it includes average Americans and interest groups and civic groups that are concerned about gun violence and who want to see common-sense action taken that respects and protects our Second Amendment rights but helps prevent those who should not have weapons from getting them, from attaining them, and helps prevent potential violent actors from obtaining the kinds of weapons that could inflict so much damage -- which addresses the ammunition clip issue.</p>\n<p>So he will, I\'m sure, be calling on mayors to support this effort.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s just the start of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the debt ceiling, top administration officials did a call with, like, dozens of executives today -- CEOs and stuff.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering if you could flesh that out a little for us as well.\xc2\xa0 What is it that the administration is looking for the business community and corporate executives to do in terms of exerting pressure on Congress for the debt ceiling?\xc2\xa0 How much do you think you can count on them explicitly?\xc2\xa0 Like beyond urging members not to hold it up, what do you actually expect them to do?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Speak up about any concern they may have -- and this applies to anyone who has this concern who is in a position of influence -- to speak up about any concern they may have about Congress -- in this case, Republicans, in particular in the House -- using flirtation with default as a tactic because the implications of that are so profound for our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mentioned this earlier, but here\xe2\x80\x99s Honeywell chairman and CEO, David Cote, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYou should not be using the debt limit as a bargaining chip when it comes to how you run the country.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t put the full faith and credit of the United States at risk.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Again, the Chamber of Commerce -- I quote -- \xe2\x80\x9cThe Chamber believes we should not risk defaulting and therefore the debt ceiling needs to be raised.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\'s the Chamber of Commerce.</p>\n<p>Alan Simpson, co-author of the world-famous Simpson-Bowles plan, says of the proposition that the GOP might use the debt ceiling as a leverage point, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI think that would be a grave mistake.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that would solve anything.\xc2\xa0 I think they are going to try it\xe2\x80\x9d -- I hope he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong about that -- \xe2\x80\x9cand how far they will go with that game of chicken I have no idea.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you, you can\'t, you really can\'t.\xc2\xa0 This is stuff that we\'ve already indebted ourselves.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you\'re a real conservative, a really honest conservative, without hypocrisy, you would want to pay your debt.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Let me repeat:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are a real conservative, a really honest conservative, without hypocrisy, you would want to pay your debt.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\'s Alan Simpson, former Republican senator.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the number of voices out there making that point I think is a positive thing when we talk about the absolute necessity for Congress to do its job, for Republicans in Congress not to play chicken with the full faith and credit of the United States, to raise the debt ceiling without drama, without delay; and then to engage in positive, healthy, constructive discussion and negotiation about how we move forward in reducing our deficit in a balanced way, and doing so in a way that allows the economy to continue to grow so that we\'re making investments in education, and research and development, and elsewhere, in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t ask seniors to bear the burden of deficit reduction entirely -- in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President is eager to have those negotiations, and is eager to compromise in a way that protects his principles, as he has demonstrated in the past.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 Oh, I do owe Mr. Knoller -- you\'re looking a little forlorn.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what prompted President Obama to change the license plate on his limousines?\xc2\xa0 For four years he didn\xe2\x80\x99t use the \xe2\x80\x9cTaxation Without Representation\xe2\x80\x9d plates, but on Saturday we hear he will be putting them on it.\xc2\xa0 Why did he change his mind about that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 President Obama now has lived in the District for four years and has seen firsthand how patently unfair it is for working families in D.C. to work hard, raise children, and pay taxes without having a vote in Congress.\xc2\xa0 Attaching these plates to the presidential vehicles demonstrates the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the principle of full representation for the people of the District of Columbia and his willingness to fight for voting rights, home rule, and budget autonomy for the district.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s your answer.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead or are you going to brief tomorrow?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 See you tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from me in some fashion tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t decided yet.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:03 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
