EST</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 Glad you braved the cold to make it to the White House today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything at the top, Josh, so if you want to get us started with questions I\'ll let you go first.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the 800,000 Americans who won\'t be able to file their taxes on time because the government sent them incorrect tax information about insurance through healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 What went wrong?\xc2\xa0 And what is the administration doing to fix it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Josh, let me just correct one fact in your question.\xc2\xa0 This should have no impact on the ability of people to file their taxes on time.\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate -- HHS has said that they anticipate that they\xe2\x80\x99d be able to send these updated forms in the next couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 So it would be ample time for people to file in advance of April 15th.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s important for us to sort of take a step back here and recognize what we\'re talking about.\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking about the fact that, first of all, 75 percent of people who file their taxes will just check a box on their tax forms to indicate that they have health insurance, whether that health insurance is provided through their employer, by Medicare, or even the VA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The form that you\'re talking about only has an impact on those who are likely to qualify for tax credits to make their health insurance more affordable.\xc2\xa0 This is health insurance that they purchased through a marketplace.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also true that the vast majority of people who received this form actually got the correct version of it.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re talking about a very small fraction of people who are affected --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, 800,000 people is not a very small amount of people, though.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s a small percentage of overall tax filers. You\'re talking about less than 1 percent of people who file taxes.\xc2\xa0 And each of these individuals are people who are eligible for tax credits -- or likely to be eligible for tax credits from the government.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re talking about -- the question that has to be resolved is just how substantial of a tax credit are they going to receive from the federal government to make their health insurance more affordable.\xc2\xa0 And that is the question that HHS and the Treasury Department are working to resolve.\xc2\xa0 And we do anticipate that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to resolve this within the next couple of weeks in terms of sending out the updated form to the small percentage of people who got the wrong one.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of what went wrong and what is being done to prevent it happening again, can you give us some insight into that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is the process that\'s being run at CMS, so I\'d encourage you to direct your questions over there to understand what sort of operational steps they\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking to ensure something like this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 The Pentagon has started laying out details about this operation to retake Mosul that is going to be getting underway in a couple months -- very specific operational details about how many Iraqi brigades, Peshmerga forces.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, why detail this in advance?\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that just give your playbook to the Islamic State and make it easier for them to prepare to defend themselves against such an attack?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Josh, I think I saw many of the same news reports that you may have seen on this.\xc2\xa0 This sort of operational planning that was discussed at the Department of Defense is something that\xe2\x80\x99s done by the Department of Defense, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to confirm the accuracy of those details.\xc2\xa0 But what we do know are a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is that, of course, the Department of Defense is working closely with Iraqi security forces to train and equip them and build up their capacity so that they can take the fight on the ground in their own country to the ISIL militants that have encroached on their territory.\xc2\xa0 So this will be an effort that will be led by Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>The second thing is that this is an offensive that won\xe2\x80\x99t begin until the Iraqi security forces are ready. \xc2\xa0This is something that will be Iraqi-led and it will be carried out by Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 Now, they will, of course, be backed up by the coalition airstrikes that have proven quite effective on the battlefield against ISIL, and we would anticipate that with this advanced training, with new equipment, and with the strong support of coalition military airpower, that the battlefield performance of the Iraqi security forces will be enhanced.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But for the details about when this might commence, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 And as it relates to reports that we saw overnight about what that offensive may look like, I can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm the accuracy of that, and I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense who, again, may be in a position to offer you some more details about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to confirm the accuracy of those reports, but is there a concern among the National Security Council that if the Pentagon is handing out the playbook for what this operation is going to look like that it could make it less effective?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess the point that I\xe2\x80\x99m making here is that I cannot confirm that that is the playbook.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President made a decision about whether, during that Mosul operation, to send in a limited number of U.S. ground troops specifically to help call in airstrikes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has not made that decision.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not even in a position to confirm that that request has been made by his military commanders.\xc2\xa0 This is something that General Dempsey discussed in his testimony before Congress and at that point -- last fall -- and at that point, what he said was this was an option that he would consider recommending to the President.\xc2\xa0 But as of last fall, he had not made a decision to recommend to the President that that was something that American military personnel should be in the position of doing.</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new to report on this.\xc2\xa0 But what is true about the strategy that we have pursued here is that we believe it is in the best interest of American national security for the Iraqi people and their nation\xe2\x80\x99s military forces to fight for their own country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we tried it a different way; we tried it in the previous administration by deploying more than 100,000 U.S. military personnel to go on the ground and engage in sustained offensive combat operations in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And what we found is that the security situation improved dramatically as a result of the courage and effectiveness of American military personnel. But what we found was that that solution was not enduring.\xc2\xa0 It did not endure because there was not sufficient buy-in from the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 And that is why our strategy this time is necessarily different, that we want the Iraqi people to be fighting for their own country.</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the strategy -- the President has pursued this strategy because he believes it is in the national security interest of the United States, but also that the Iraqi people and the security situation in Iraq will be better off under this strategy as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And since it\xe2\x80\x99s Friday, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, in his attempt to clean up some comments he made about the President not loving America, says that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly have been racist with those remarks because the President has a white mother and grew up among white people.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to that from the White House?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Josh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a direct response to Mr. Giuliani\xe2\x80\x99s comments, either from --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It looks like you have one to look to right there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you indulge me for a little bit and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can give you something to work with, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not a direct response to his comments.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many of you have been in the room when the President has delivered speeches where he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about his love for this country or how the United States is a force for good in the world; in fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest force for good that the world has ever seen.\xc2\xa0 And so we can send you those examples, and many of you have been in the room when he has delivered remarks like that, both in this country and around the world.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More generally, I can tell you that it\xe2\x80\x99s sad to see when somebody who has attained a certain level of public stature and even admiration tarnishes that legacy so thoroughly.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is I don\xe2\x80\x99t take any joy or vindication or satisfaction from that.\xc2\xa0 I think, really, the only thing that I feel is I feel sorry for Rudy Giuliani today.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Roberta.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On immigration.\xc2\xa0 A couple of days ago, you said that the administration would make a decision in a couple days about whether to pursue a stay of the Texas court judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.\xc2\xa0 Has a decision been made?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the hold-up?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Roberta, what I can tell you is that the Department of Justice has made a decision to file a stay in this case.\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that they will file documents at the district court level on Monday at the latest.\xc2\xa0 And so when they have filed those documents, they and we will be in a position to talk a little bit more about our legal strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That, of course, is separate and apart from our intent to pursue an appeal.\xc2\xa0 That was something that we announced in the immediate aftermath of the decision.\xc2\xa0 And we will seek that appeal because we believe that when you evaluate the legal merits of the arguments that there is a solid legal foundation for the President to take the steps that he announced late last year to reform our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the way that previous Presidents over the course of several decades have used their executive authority.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to pursue this case through the legal system.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So by filing a stay, what does that mean for people who are considering filing their paperwork for the program?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Department of Homeland Security has also put out a statement earlier this week indicating that, at this point, they\xe2\x80\x99re not prepared to accept applications for the program that the President announced at the end of last year, but once we have taken some additional steps through this legal process, we may be in a position to give you an update about the status of implementing the program.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, some of this will depend on the way that the question of the stay is resolved.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 If I may jump to one other topic just briefly.\xc2\xa0 A senior Republican lawmaker, Kay Granger, has urged the administration to give Egypt fighter jets and weapons to fight ISIL, and she also wants to see weapons provided to Jordan and tools and training for the Peshmerga.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether the White House has a response to her demands and whether there\xe2\x80\x99s any sort of explanation about why there\xe2\x80\x99s been this hold-up with the fighter jets, specifically.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Roberta, as you know, each of the countries -- let me just start by saying I have not seen the remarks from Congresswoman Granger.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing them from you for the first time.\xc2\xa0 But my initial reaction is that the countries that you and apparently she named are all countries that have a robust security relationship with the United States, a security relationship that\'s been enhanced under the leadership of President Obama.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>*\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s true of Egypt, with whom we have a very important counterterrorism relationship.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously worked through and, in some cases, are even still working through some of the differences that we have with that government.\xc2\xa0 But there is an important counterterrorism relationship between the United States and <strike>Israel</strike> Egypt, and we continue to believe that the interests of the United States are well served by continuing to have a strong counterterrorism relationship with them.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think something similar could be said about Jordan. \xc2\xa0So we certainly welcome her interest in this issue.\xc2\xa0 But the administration has been focused for quite some time in making sure that we are working to maintain a strong security relationship with our allies and partners in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just getting back to Mayor Giuliani.\xc2\xa0 Did the President have a reaction to those comments?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not that you\'re aware of.\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on the President\xe2\x80\x99s speeches this week on the countering violent extremism, specifically the one yesterday, he talked about some of the underlying issues that lead to extremism in the Muslim and Arab world, and he talked about the need for economic opportunity, human rights, democratic rights.\xc2\xa0 But it seems that many of the countries that he would be referring to are members of his own coalition.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to be making that case to the Emir of Qatar, for example, when he comes to the White House next week?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to preview those discussions, but it\xe2\x80\x99s true, Jim, that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a coincidence that the President was talking about human rights and urging those world leaders to be cognizant of universal human values and to do their part to protect them.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We do have important relationships with those countries.\xc2\xa0 They are valuable to enhancing U.S. national security around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, the President believes that it would be clearly in the interest of those countries, their leaders, and our national security if many of those countries did a better job of protecting the basic universal human rights of their citizens; that there are certain circumstances where we know that the governments -- or governments around the world when they fail to protect those human rights, that that only makes the recruiting ground for some terrorists more fertile.\xc2\xa0 And this is what the President was talking about in his remarks.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so, no, it is not a coincidence that in a room full of our allies and partners, some of whom don\'t live up to the kinds of standards that we wish they would when it comes to human rights, that the President brought it up.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These countries are breeding grounds for terrorists?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what I said, and that\'s not what the President said.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I mean, that is, in fact, the potential.\xc2\xa0 If he\xe2\x80\x99s talking to these countries, and they have these issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about immigration?\xc2\xa0 Is the President ruling out a continuing resolution to keep the Department of Homeland Security open?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the Congress, particularly Republicans in Congress who now have the majority in both the House and the Senate, should fulfill their responsibility to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security doesn\'t shut down at the end of this month.\xc2\xa0 We\'re basically about a week away from the funding for the Department of Homeland Security running out.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s running out because Republicans insisted on not funding it for a full year at the end of last year.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s on the brink of running out because Republicans have failed to take the steps that are necessary at the beginning of this year to ensure that the operations of that department are properly funded.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we certainly hope that they will.\xc2\xa0 There are all kinds of proposals that are floating out there, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to react to any of them specifically.\xc2\xa0 But I will just say as a general matter that it is the responsibility of Republicans in Congress to do their job.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99ll sign something to keep things going if it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for a couple days to work out specifics, or --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t want to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there flexibility there?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any sort of specific proposals like that.\xc2\xa0 But let me just also say that Congress is going to be returning from a week-long recess next week.\xc2\xa0 So on Monday, members of Congress from all over the country, many of them are going to board airplanes to return to Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 And as they do so, they\'re going to through security just like other Americans, and I hope that they\'re going to take a minute and look in the eye of TSA officers who are representing their country.\xc2\xa0 Those are patriotic Americans who are defending the transportation system, defending the airports, defending the safety of the traveling public.\xc2\xa0 And I hope that they will think about them as they come back to Washington, and consider what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Because if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, those individuals who process their luggage, who they had to look in the eye, will continue to do their job.\xc2\xa0 These are good Americans.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re patriotic.\xc2\xa0 They take their work seriously.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re professionals.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get paid on time unless members of Congress step up and do their jobs.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that when Republicans confront that reality, that they\xe2\x80\x99ll do the right thing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jon.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, coming back to the three-day summit on combatting violent extremism, why was FBI Director James Comey not invited to that summit?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of reasons.\xc2\xa0 One is, his boss was.\xc2\xa0 The nation\xe2\x80\x99s top law enforcement official, Attorney General Eric Holder, attended.\xc2\xa0 The second is, we also had local law enforcement officials from across the country who could talk about their own experience in working with community leaders to counter violence extremism in their communities.\xc2\xa0 And the third is we wanted to make sure that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a perception that this conference was overly focused on law enforcement tactics.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, law enforcement has a very important role to play.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we had the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top law enforcement official in attendance.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we had police chiefs and other law enforcement officials from communities across the country in attendance.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the focus here is on the broader set of tools that are available to communities all across the country to protect vulnerable people who could be susceptible to violent extremist ideology that\xe2\x80\x99s propagated on social media.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Josh, in terms of combatting violent extremism --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s countering violent extremism.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, \xe2\x80\x9ccountering.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s say we want to combat it, too.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in terms of countering violent extremism, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the FBI Director -- the head of the agency that is on the front line of doing exactly that.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re having a summit, a three-day meeting on countering violent extremism, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t invite the lead official in charge of countering violent extremism.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 We just invited his boss.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So you invite the Attorney General, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the FBI Director, but you did have the head of the Russian security service there.\xc2\xa0 How does that look?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, he was listening carefully when the President was talking about the importance of government respecting and protecting basic universal human rights.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t think that sends a strange message, to have the head of the Russian FSB, the successor to the KGB, at this meeting and not the FBI Director?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, to be clear about the Russian official who attended, the United States issued an invitation to the country; and Russia, in this case, made the decision about which official from their government would represent them.\xc2\xa0 So it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as if there was an invitation that was sent specifically to this official.\xc2\xa0 This is the official that the Russian government chose to represent them at the summit.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there any hesitation of having that official there from Russia, given that he is on the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s sanctions list related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another question about this.\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone back and forth over why the President\xe2\x80\x99s officials don\xe2\x80\x99t use \xe2\x80\x9cIslamic terror\xe2\x80\x9d as a term, or \xe2\x80\x9cIslamic extremists\xe2\x80\x9d --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say we\xe2\x80\x99ve all gone back and forth over that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, we all have.\xc2\xa0 But I just want to be -- just to button it up and be clear.\xc2\xa0 The White House, the President -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t deny that in terms of the current threat, the groups that we are battling now, the primary threat are Islamic extremists?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not something you disagree with, is it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, there is no doubt -- and I said this, if you go back and look at the comments the last time that we went around on this, on Wednesday -- I think I was pretty clear about this, that there is a very real threat that is emanating from some of the darkest corners of the Muslim community around the world that does threaten Americans.\xc2\xa0 And that is a threat that we are very cognizant of.\xc2\xa0 And there are substantial --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the primary threat we\'re facing right now?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of countering violent extremism, of course, it is.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not the only threat that we face, but of course, it\'s the primary one.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And buttoning up on Rudy Giuliani, you said something interesting.\xc2\xa0 You said -- correct me, but you basically feel sorry for him.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is kind of -- you\'re kind of sorry to see what\xe2\x80\x99s happened here.\xc2\xa0 Do you think Rudy Giuliani has lost it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 But, look, any time that we have -- there is somebody who has attained a certain level of public stature and even admiration, in some cases, to see that person so thoroughly tarnish their legacy, it\'s sad.\xc2\xa0 And again, there\xe2\x80\x99s no element of schadenfreude that people are feeling around here.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, I think what people are feeling is sorry for Rudy Giuliani.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And because, again, on this specific allegation, which -- however you want to characterize it -- but he says that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President loves America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there are a number of examples -- and, Jon, you\xe2\x80\x99ve traveled around the world with the President so you know firsthand that there are a number of situations in which the President said exactly that.\xc2\xa0 The most high-profile example that I can think of was actually the last line of this year\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union in which the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless this country we love.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What makes somebody of that stature, Rudy Giuliani, what makes him say something like that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, given your sorrow for Rudy Giuliani, do you think the President has any regrets about saying President Bush was unpatriotic for adding $4 trillion to the debt?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I don\'t know if \xe2\x80\x9csorrow\xe2\x80\x9d is the word that I would use.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel sorry for Rudy Giuliani.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I do.\xc2\xa0 I do feel sorry for him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so you feel sorry, but does the President have any regrets?\xc2\xa0 Regardless of what Giuliani said -- as a candidate, Senator Obama said that President Bush was unpatriotic.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, I haven\'t seen the actual comments.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if you have them there in front of you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said that the President -- I\'m paraphrasing this part -- had added about $4 trillion to the debt, and then he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\'s irresponsible.\xc2\xa0 That\'s unpatriotic.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So I see a difference from Giuliani because he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about an issue, but nonetheless questioning the patriotism of the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that what the President was doing was he was questioning the specific wisdom of that decision and questioning whether or not that was in the best interest of the country.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that\xe2\x80\x99s unwise.\xc2\xa0 He said that\'s unpatriotic.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Right.\xc2\xa0 But again, he was talking about that.\xc2\xa0 He was not talking about a person.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think there is a lot that the President also had to say in the State of the Union about the level of our discourse, and there is no doubt that we\'re going to have significant disagreements across the aisle, and that is ultimately what a democracy is all about, where we go in and we debate the issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the President, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, in the State of the Union said we should have a debate that\'s worthy of the United States Congress and worthy of the country; that there are significant challenges facing this country, and that sort of resorting to a politics in which we question each other\xe2\x80\x99s basic decency is not consistent with the reason that a lot of people got into public service.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the summit, I want to go back to what Jon was asking about James Comey.\xc2\xa0 You made clear, well, look, his boss, Eric Holder, was there.\xc2\xa0 But you also said, we wanted to make sure this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t overly focused on law enforcement.\xc2\xa0 With that decision and other decisions at the summit, were you tiptoeing around not offending Muslims?\xc2\xa0 Or is there some reason why the summit was largely about just not offending Muslims for some reason?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the way that anybody here would characterize the summit.\xc2\xa0 I think this was an opportunity for us to have a very frank discussion with people all across the country about steps that countries can take to try to protect their communities and try to prevent people from being inspired by this radical ideology that is propagated through social media.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think the goal of this summit was actually not to tiptoe around these issues but actually to confront them head on.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we had leaders of law enforcement, we had leaders of the Muslim community who participated in this summit.\xc2\xa0 And it was an opportunity for us to have a frank discussion of these issues that certainly, as Jon pointed out, there is concern about the way that some of this ideology has infiltrated some Muslim communities.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s an extremist threat that inhabits other communities in this country, and we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of those threats as well, and all of them were discussed at the summit.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of confronting it head on, the former CIA Director, James Woolsey, was on CNN and said that he believes by refusing to call it Islamic terror, the President \xe2\x80\x9clooks scared.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the countless terrorists that have been wiped off the battlefield as the result of military action that this President has ordered feel that the President is particularly fearful.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the health care issue -- last one.\xc2\xa0 I thought your narrative was that Healthcare.gov was really doing a lot better.\xc2\xa0 Who is going to be held accountable for what seems like a pretty big mistake?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, as I pointed out earlier, what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about is we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a form that only has -- that will actually determine the size of the tax credit that an individual will receive from the federal government that will make their health care more affordable.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about less than 1 percent of taxpayers being affected.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about government agencies between HHS and CMS and the IRS that are responsible for making sure that this gets fixed and gets done right.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to address this promptly and ensure that people can pay their taxes on time.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Alexis.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, two quick things.\xc2\xa0 When the President selected Hillary Clinton to be Secretary of State, the White House and representatives of the Clintons spent some time talking about what some of the ground rules might be to eliminate maybe conflicts with what Bill Clinton might be doing, what the foundation might be doing, what the Clinton Global Initiative might be doing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And my question is, in relationship to some of the reporting about potential conflicts between Secretary of States\xe2\x80\x99 activities in the administration and the fundraising for the family foundation, does the President believe there are any legitimate questions that need to be answered about problems that he and his representatives wanted to eliminate at the beginning?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Alexis, this is a question that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t given a lot of thought.\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department for any sort of questions like this that may have arisen.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any.\xc2\xa0 But as you pointed out, there was an effort early on to make sure that obviously the former President\xe2\x80\x99s large international profile was clarified and distinct from the official U.S. government activities, and there are situations in which former President Clinton did play an important role in representing the interests of the United States government.</p>\n<p>Obviously, there was the effort that he led to build support for rebuilding Haiti after they suffered that terrible earthquake.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, former President Clinton took a high-profile trip to North Korea to recover a U.S. citizen that had been detained there.\xc2\xa0 So obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s important to keep all of those things distinct.</p>\n<p>But as it relates to any sort of questions like this, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any that have been raised at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to follow up -- one quick cleanup on what Josh was asking earlier.\xc2\xa0 Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one who\xe2\x80\x99s confused about this, but are you saying that on the final day of the summit, that the President was not aware that there was a background briefing happening at the Defense Department to outline an operation that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to happen in the spring?\xc2\xa0 You seem to be suggesting the President was not aware of this.\xc2\xa0 Am I wrong?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that that was the focal point of Josh\xe2\x80\x99s question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so answer that question.\xc2\xa0 He is aware of this operation, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking like four different things at the same time here.\xc2\xa0 Was the President aware of the background briefing that was being conducted by some military officials at the Central Command?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President was --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s aware of the operation?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an operation the details of which I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to confirm.\xc2\xa0 So if you are asking about whether or not the President is aware that the United States military is engaged in an effort to strengthen and fortify the Iraqi security forces, back them up with military airpower so that they can start retaking chunks of their country -- the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t just aware of that mission, he\xe2\x80\x99s the one who ordered it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But maybe my confusion is about why you cannot comment on detail of the operation, but yet you can comment on the strategy?\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99re asking questions about --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense is responsible for setting out the operational details of a mission.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m directing questions about these operational details to the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you were aware that DOD was going to brief reporters?\xc2\xa0 You -- you were aware of that yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you were just asking about the President being aware of it, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And now I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you this.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I was necessarily aware that Central Command -- not the Department of Defense -- but Central Command was conducting a briefing.\xc2\xa0 But again, there are any number of briefings that take place across the federal government on a daily basis, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t sign off on all of them.\xc2\xa0 Why are you shaking your head?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seemed like you were answering --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess if I did sign off on these background briefings I might be accused of mismanaging --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, if you were --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- or micromanaging the Department of Defense, and I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be accused of doing that.</p>\n<p>Okay, Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Getting back to the funding for Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 The President met with Senator Reid this week.\xc2\xa0 Did they discuss a path forward?\xc2\xa0 Or have you had conversations with the Hill.\xc2\xa0 What do you expect to happen next week?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Cheryl, I think the ball is in the court of the majorities in the House and Senate to make a decision about whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re going to fulfill their responsibility to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is properly funded.\xc2\xa0 If they don\xe2\x80\x99t take action by the end of next week, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in a position where there are DHS personnel that are showing up on a daily basis to protect our ports, to protect our borders, to protect the friendly skies, so to speak, who will be doing so without collecting a paycheck on time.\xc2\xa0 And the President doesn\'t believe that\'s fair.\xc2\xa0 He also doesn\'t believe that\'s in the best interests of our homeland security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we are concerned about the impact that this disruption in funding could have on Homeland Security operations.\xc2\xa0 We\'re hopeful that Republicans will do the right and responsible thing, and ensure that that agency is funded.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that really kind of what you\'re expecting, is maybe a shutdown?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, prognosticating when it comes to congressional action, particularly now that there\xe2\x80\x99s this Republican majority in place, is not something I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to do -- at least in public.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Josh.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You have a birthday coming up, I see.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I do -- (laughter) -- everybody how old I am. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Happy early birthday.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll withhold those details in terms of your age.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 The tax forms that went out erroneously, I realize you\'re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s a small fraction of the forms that went out.\xc2\xa0 But we still have nearly a million people, roughly, who are going to have to wait to file their returns.\xc2\xa0 Admittedly, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to do that before April 15th, but many of those people are owed refunds, so this is money that the government is going to be hanging on to for weeks at least.\xc2\xa0 And they won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to file for their returns.\xc2\xa0 Aren\xe2\x80\x99t those people owed an apology?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ll say, Mark.\xc2\xa0 The IRS and CMS are working diligently to address this problem.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s something that they take seriously.\xc2\xa0 But you were right to point out that the individuals who are affected are individuals who have received, or are receiving a tax credit from the government to make their health insurance more affordable.\xc2\xa0 And this is why they\xe2\x80\x99re working expeditiously to address this problem.\xc2\xa0 And, like I said, we do anticipate that in the next couple of weeks we\xe2\x80\x99ll have this cleared up.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no apology is necessary for the fact the government is going to be hanging on to their money for weeks?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess, Mark, what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do here is to try to solve this problem.\xc2\xa0 And certainly the American people should hold their government to a high standard and should count on these kinds of operations being implemented effectively.\xc2\xa0 And when they\xe2\x80\x99re not, they should expect government officials to step forward and solve them as quickly as possible, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of those people also are going to have to refile their taxes, those who\xe2\x80\x99ve already filed, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a substitute form.\xc2\xa0 Is this another self-inflicted wound, Josh?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of the mechanics about whether a refiling is necessary, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the IRS.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that that\xe2\x80\x99s necessarily true.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In any event, is it another self-inflicted wound?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly is something that we want to make sure doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you, Josh, about the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks that I watched a little bit earlier.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke at the DNC, and I realize it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of an opportunity to cheerlead for fellow Democrats, but this meeting comes, I guess you could say, on the heels of a very bad midterm election.\xc2\xa0 Democrats lost the Senate.\xc2\xa0 They lost more seats in the House.\xc2\xa0 Why was there, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, no recognition of that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess, John, what the President talked very directly in his remarks about the need for the country to look forward.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on, is the future of the country.\xc2\xa0 And the President wanted to talk about what are the values that he believes the party should stand for.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the nominal lead of the -- head of the Democratic Party, as the highest ranking elected official in the Democratic Party. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he was there to do, was to sort of lay out what he believed was his own vision for the country and how that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the values that our party has espoused for quite a long time.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President, though, it seemed, was looking backwards in a way.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe American people stand right beside us on most of these issues.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, why did Democrats do so poorly in the midterm elections if they do stand beside the President on so many of these issues?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, people have spent the last four months or so combing through the results of the midterm elections with their own theory and analysis about the outcome.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to continue doing that, but I think I\xe2\x80\x99m done.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why no mention of ISIS to this group that gathered today here in Washington?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Frankly, he was speaking to a political group and focused on politics, and they did spend a lot of time talking about the economy.\xc2\xa0 But, frankly, when it comes to national security, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe necessarily that that\xe2\x80\x99s at the top of the list when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about politics, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can I follow up?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Byron.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Was the White House aware that the NSA reportedly stole information from a private European company in order to access encrypted cellphone data?\xc2\xa0 Is that something the White House is aware of or signed off on?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Byron, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- I believe you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the latest report from The Intercept, I believe that publication is called.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific information about that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the NSA.\xc2\xa0 I believe that the documents, however, were -- the basis of that report were actually from the U.K.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they dealt with a U.S. agency.\xc2\xa0 It was a joint operation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to confirm or to discuss the details of those documents.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the U.K. government about that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a legal authority, though, that the White House claims the ability to hack a private company for security reasons, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s an allied country or not?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there a legal theory under pins --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 For the legal basis of some of these kinds of questions, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to either the DNI or the NSA.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more try.\xc2\xa0 The White House recently has talked a lot about building public-private partnerships with U.S. tech companies for cybersecurity reasons.\xc2\xa0 Can the U.S. tech industry trust the U.S. government in the wake of some of these disclosures?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Byron, we certainly are aware of how important it is for the United States government to work with private industry; that there are a lot of situations in which our interests are pretty cleanly aligned.\xc2\xa0 And there are certainly steps that the U.S. government has taken in the name of national security that some members of private industry haven\xe2\x80\x99t agreed with.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that there is common ground when it comes to -- and this is a principle that I\xe2\x80\x99ve cited before -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to imagine that there are a lot of technology executives that are out there that are in a position of saying that they hope that people who wish harm to this country will be able to use their technology to do so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I do think, in fact, that there are opportunities for the private sector and the federal government to coordinate and to cooperate on these efforts, both to keep the country safe but also to protect our civil liberties.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about technology companies and technology executives that have a lot of expertise in this area.\xc2\xa0 And we can benefit from their insight and their perspective as we confront I think what everybody acknowledges are some pretty thorny public policy issues.\xc2\xa0 But by working together, we are confident that we can reach some common ground that reflects the necessary balance of protecting civil liberties, but also protecting the national security of the United States.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple things on the -- well, the second part of the Obamacare announcement today had to do with uninsured Americans, and there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a special period for them, people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize that they were going to have to pay a penalty for not signing up for Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House concerned that this latest problem with the taxes will reinforce a perception in some quarters that parts of Obamacare are broken and will make people who are uninsured less likely to sign up?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 If anything, Chris, I think this is an opportunity for us to talk about the fact that there are millions of people all across the country who can go to a marketplace, who can shop for health care, and they can actually get a tax credit from the federal government to make that health care more affordable.\xc2\xa0 And so --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can understand why someone would say, yeah, but if I had to sign up for Obamacare I could potentially not have my tax return now, or I will have to go back to the Treasury Department, or I can\xe2\x80\x99t file yet.\xc2\xa0 Does it perpetuate an idea that there are all these problems with Obamacare?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it is a good reminder that there are millions of people that stand to benefit from this law, and all they need to do is to go to the marketplace.\xc2\xa0 And there are some people who, as you point out, may still be unaware of the fact that they will face a penalty if they don\xe2\x80\x99t sign up and if they haven\'t signed up.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the IRS and the Treasury and HHS have coordinated on what we believe is a pretty novel solution to this challenge, which is to set up a special enrollment period for individuals who did have to pay a penalty in their 2014 taxes for not having health insurance, and were previously unaware that they were required to do so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there will be this limited six-week window in which those individuals can ensure that they can limit the penalty that they have to pay and actually make sure that that money is going to a good purpose, which is protecting themselves and members of their family with health insurance.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how do you respond to Republicans who say this is just another example of how this was not well thought out, that it\xe2\x80\x99s a constantly moving target, they\xe2\x80\x99re constantly changing the rules of the game?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think what I would do is I would just refer them to the seniors across the country who have saved billions of dollars on their prescription drugs because of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer those Republicans to the fact that since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, health care costs have grown at the slowest rate in recorded history.\xc2\xa0 I would note that the uninsured rate in the United States has gone down faster than at any time since the early 1970s.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I\xe2\x80\x99d just point out also that hospitals have saved an estimated $5.7 billion just last year in lower, uncompensated care costs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s good for our deficit.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly good for the bottom line of those hospitals.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s also good for every American in the country that has insurance, because it\xe2\x80\x99s going to have an impact on their premiums.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there are substantial benefits associated with the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And I recognize that it\xe2\x80\x99s awkward for some Republicans who voted against the law that has resulted in such significant benefits for the country.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s probably pretty difficult for them to explain, so I can imagine that they may be looking for an opportunity to try to wriggle out of that.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s going to become just more and more difficult as time moves on here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could read one sentence from the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks today at the DNC, taking them out of context.\xc2\xa0 But he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s making a nation we love more perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Was that written in after as a response to Rudy Giuliani?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was not.\xc2\xa0 As I pointed out, the President said something very similar at the end of the State of Union address this year -- \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless this country we love.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So the fact is the President often talks about his love for this country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not unique.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lori, nice to see you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good to see you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 What is the reaction of the administration to the latest events in Venezuela?\xc2\xa0 And also, President Nicol\xc3\xa1s Maduro accused the government, the U.S. government of trying to overthrow his government in a plot that they say they discovered last Wednesday.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 These allegations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the Maduro government, like all previous such allegations, are ludicrous.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the Venezuelan government should stop trying to blame the United States and other members of the international community for events inside Venezuela.\xc2\xa0 The Venezuelan government actually needs to deal with the grave situation that it faces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The United States is not promoting unrest in Venezuela, nor are we attempting to undermine Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s economy or its government.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the United States remains Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s largest trading partner.\xc2\xa0 The Venezuelan government should stop trying to distract attention from the country\xe2\x80\x99s economic and political problems, and focus on finding real solutions through democratic dialogue among the people of Venezuela.\xc2\xa0 The Venezuelan government should respect the human rights of its citizens and stop trying to intimidate its political opponents.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we continue to call on the Venezuelan government to release political prisoners, including dozens of students; opposition leader; and Mayors Daniel Ceballos and Antonio Ledezma.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The U.S. government has already taken some actions against Venezuelan individuals with some sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Are you considering any other action?\xc2\xa0 Are you seeking -- maybe seeking help from other countries in the hemisphere, like Brazil, that could put pressure on the government of Nicol\xc3\xa1s Maduro?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the Treasury Department and the State Department are obviously closely monitoring this situation and are considering tools that may be available that could better steer the Venezuelan government in the direction that they believe they should be headed.\xc2\xa0 That obviously means that we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to engage other countries in the region in talking about operating in coordinated fashion as we deal with the situation there.</p>\n<p>But ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the responsibility of the government of Venezuela to stop blaming other countries, including the United States, for their problems, and start tackling them head-on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I ask you one last question?\xc2\xa0 This is in regard to an emergency stay.\xc2\xa0 The Justice Department I understand will file probably by Monday.\xc2\xa0 If that is denied, what would be the next step for the administration?\xc2\xa0 And how frustrated would you be that these DACA/DAPA would not be implemented?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to assume the rejection of a legal document that has not yet been created or filed yet.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to talk about this more next week, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the thing that you should remember is, in addition to the stay that we do anticipate will be filed by Monday at the latest, the U.S. government will be appealing the decision.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is we continue to believe that there is a solid legal foundation for the steps that the President has taken to bring some accountability to our broken immigration system.</p>\n<p>And there are a couple of other important points that are worth noting about the ruling.\xc2\xa0 The first is that the ruling did prevent the federal government from issuing work permits and requiring state agencies to issue driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses and other documentation.\xc2\xa0 And I recognize that this is a ruling that some Republicans have cheered.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is, those steps are exactly the kind of steps that are required to bring millions of people out of the shadows, to make them submit to a background check, to make them pay taxes, to make them get right with the law.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s surprising to me that that kind of accountability is something that Republicans would actually oppose, not to speak of the kinds of significant economic benefits that would be associated with these individuals actually paying taxes.</p>\n<p>The second thing is, the court ruling doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, however, touch the ability of this administration to make decisions about prosecutorial discretion.\xc2\xa0 And one element of the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposed reforms was to ensure that our enforcement activities were focused on felons and not on families; that we believe that these efforts should be focused on rounding up and deporting individuals that have a criminal history, individuals that may pose a national security threat of some kind, or individuals who may otherwise pose some kind of public safety threat to the communities in which they\'re living.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we should not be doing is using those very important but insufficient enforcement resources to focus on separating families; that, frankly, we need to be focused on the public safety risk that\'s out there.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why -- DHS can provide you these materials -- or these metrics.\xc2\xa0 But what we\'re seeing is an increasing number or increasing percentage of deportations has been individuals with a criminal history.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s an indication that our enforcement efforts are improving on this scale.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And thanks to the efforts of the President and this administration to exercise prosecutorial discretion, we\'re going to see that metric continue to improve.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s going to mean safer communities for everybody.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to cybersecurity and hacking.\xc2\xa0 The Journal yesterday said that three months after the State Department discovered hackers in its system, they\'re still there.\xc2\xa0 Last fall, I think around the end of October, you announced that there had been hackers discovered in the White House system.\xc2\xa0 Are they still there?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the update that I have for you on the incident here at the White House is that we have taken appropriate steps to address the activity of concern and protect our systems.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And although we have addressed this particular incident, we\'re mindful of the fact that networks at the White House will continue to be a target.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re going to continue to monitor our networks for additional activity of concern.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the course of that intrusion, I can tell you that our computer systems were not damaged, though some elements of the unclassified network were affected when we took our initial mitigation steps.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that we talked about before, as well.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve restored the vast majority of services that we took offline during those mitigation efforts, and are continuing to take additional steps to bolster our defenses.\xc2\xa0 We\'re also focused on longer-term efforts to implement broad cybersecurity initiatives that will further protect not just the computer network here at the White House but all across the federal government.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you saying that there have been no further intrusions into the White House system?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken appropriate steps to address this specific activity and the concern that we discussed last fall.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the necessary steps to ensure that our systems are protected.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re not saying that there have been no further intrusions?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is as much as I can.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, and are you concerned about the State Department situation?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, of course we are.\xc2\xa0 We are certainly monitoring that situation, as well, but in the same way that we monitor reported breaches of computer systems that affect U.S. agencies, U.S. companies and U.S. infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 Now, we\xe2\x80\x99d note that the Department of State has been working closely with a variety of government agencies, including the FBI, on a comprehensive investigation and a specific response to the intrusion that\xe2\x80\x99s taken place over there.\xc2\xa0 And that work is ongoing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scott.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on this question of the sort of awkward partnership with countries in the Middle East that contribute to the kind of grievances the President was talking about.\xc2\xa0 He was asked about this specifically last month.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99d just given a speech in India talking about religious tolerance and women\xe2\x80\x99s rights, and then he was headed to Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 And he said at the time, \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes we have to balance our need to speak to them about human rights with our immediate concerns in terms of countering terrorism and dealing with regional stability.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So my question is:\xc2\xa0 Is the President comfortable with the way that balance is struck right now?\xc2\xa0 Or is he worried that our immediate security concerns may be planting seeds for trouble down the road?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Scott, this is something that\'s evaluated on an ongoing basis.\xc2\xa0 But I think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to ensuring that the United States continues to be a beacon of liberty, and a country that stands at the vanguard of protecting basic universal human rights, is embodied in the fact that the President, when standing before these world leaders, brought it up.\xc2\xa0 Nobody asked him a question in the context of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s summit.\xc2\xa0 He brought it up proactively and talked about the need for countries to live up to their requirements that they respect and protect the universal human rights of their citizens.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President did that for a variety of reasons.\xc2\xa0 The first is, it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with our values.\xc2\xa0 But the second is, as he explained, it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the kinds of steps that countries around the world can take to counter violent extremism; that as countries take steps that are detrimental to human rights, it can enhance the ability and create a more fertile recruiting ground for extremists.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly the threat that we\'re trying to counter.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President has been pretty forthright about the need to balance all of those concerns.\xc2\xa0 There are countries that don\'t have the kind of human rights record that we\xe2\x80\x99d want them to have that yet still continue to be good partners with the United States in a way that is advantageous for our national security.\xc2\xa0 So there is -- these are complicated issues, ones that are constantly under evaluation here.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s seriousness about these issues and about speaking up and speaking out for human rights -- both because of the values associated with it, but also because of the impact it has on our national security -- again, I think is consistent with his decision to raise it proactively at yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s summit.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fred.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A couple things.\xc2\xa0 First, with the DNC winter meeting going on today, does the White House have any comment regarding the controversy in Florida with Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the allegation that she was willing to change her position on the medical marijuana?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that situation, Fred.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Congresswoman\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 It was reported in Politico that she talked to a donor and asked him to take back his criticism of her if she would change her position.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the report.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go take a look at it.\xc2\xa0 Apologies to all Politico executives out there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another question then.\xc2\xa0 On the minimum wage, you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about that with the Walmart situation.\xc2\xa0 Is there an argument, though, to be made if Walmart is doing this voluntarily, that they see an economic benefit for their part, then there may not be a need for the government to step in and mandate a wage, if the private sector is taking the lead on this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly one argument.\xc2\xa0 I think the argument, though, Fred, that I would make is that executives at Walmart certainly have a strong track record of understanding the kinds of business decisions that they can take that will enhance their bottom line.\xc2\xa0 And what these executives concluded is that offering more flexible scheduling policies to their workers and raising their wages was good for their bottom line and good for business.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the reason I think it\xe2\x80\x99s notable is that Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 excuse for not raising the minimum wage is that it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for business.\xc2\xa0 So I think this is the reason that we hold up this example, as we have with other private sector companies that have also sought to raise their workers\xe2\x80\x99 wages.\xc2\xa0 They find that it\xe2\x80\x99s good for business.\xc2\xa0 They find that it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the economy, and they find that it\xe2\x80\x99s good for their bottom line.\xc2\xa0 We believe everybody should benefit from it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it be good for all businesses, though, or just those that are as big as Walmart?\xc2\xa0 I mean, some businesses might not be able to afford it as well.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is something that when you look at the macroeconomic impact and when you look at the individual experience of businesses, that they have found that it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the bottom line.\xc2\xa0 And there are a number of small businesses that we\xe2\x80\x99ve held up as employers who are doing the right thing by their employees.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that as business owners, they are not motivated solely by charity.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re also motivated by profit, and they do believe that this is good for their bottom line, that it allows them to do a better job of retaining their workers, which cuts down on their training costs.\xc2\xa0 It also inspires greater loyalty among their workforce.\xc2\xa0 And that is a good thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, again, this can take a variety of forms.\xc2\xa0 It can take -- it could be as simple as increasing the pay in their paycheck.\xc2\xa0 It can also take the form of offering up paid sick leave or policies that allow a flexible work schedule.\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of things that will make a real difference in the lives of middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has advocated putting in place these policies all across the country, not just in a few select locations where they\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen to take action.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.\xc2\xa0 Another birthday boy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Happy birthday.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Is there a \xe2\x80\x9cbirthday interview with the President program\xe2\x80\x9d that I might qualify for?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If so, it seems like there would be a lot of radio reporters interviewing the President today, between you and Mark, and I saw that one of your colleagues at Sirius XM is having a birthday today, Tim Farley.\xc2\xa0 So something in the water, I guess, about being born on this day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind going first.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind going first.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought it was part of your \xe2\x80\x9csend a fourth-grader to the park\xe2\x80\x9d program.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Will some of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Chicago be billed out as political travel?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so.\xc2\xa0 The President was using his -- again, another example of the President using his executive authority, his official authority, to travel to Chicago and designate Pullman Park as a national monument.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He stopped at a phone bank for Rahm Emanuel, and he gave remarks there that were totally partisan.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that qualify as political travel?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to check with the attorneys.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that it does.\xc2\xa0 It means there\xe2\x80\x99s a political stop, but the reason for the travel was to make this presidential announcement about the Pullman National Monument.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But under the rules, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you required to deduct some of the taxpayer-supported travel from political travel?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s -- I can follow up with you and we can dig in on the rules on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>*Given the campaign stop for Mayor Emanuel, Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Chicago has been deemed a mixed official and political trip. Consistent with past practice, we follow all rules and regulations to ensure that the DNC or other relevant political committee pays what is required for the President to travel to political events.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and one other question.\xc2\xa0 Did the President make any decision yesterday about the site for his presidential library?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has not made any decisions, but he did have the opportunity to get a briefing, get a little update on the progress of the committee that\xe2\x80\x99s been formed to evaluate the proposals that have been put forward by a number of locations; I believe they include New York, Hawaii and Chicago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the President has not made any decisions yet.\xc2\xa0 I think one way you can tell that it was not a decision-making meeting necessarily is that the First Lady wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that she\xe2\x80\x99ll have some input on this decision, as well.\xc2\xa0 But when we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to -- when a decision has been reached and we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to roll out an announcement, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll be hearing from the committee.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It lasted two hours, the meeting.\xc2\xa0 It seems like they had a lot of time to discuss the issue.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d note that a lot of the people who participated in that meeting are also friends of the President, so my guess is they were mixing a little business and pleasure.</p>\n<p>Andrew.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on Libya.\xc2\xa0 Islamic State has claimed responsibility for bombings that have killed up to 40 people in eastern Libya today.\xc2\xa0 Why is there a military response to Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and not in Libya, given these increased number of attacks that you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is that the United States condemns today\xe2\x80\x99s terrorist attack near Qubba, Libya that took the lives of more than 40 innocent victims, as well as all the other violence and terrorist acts that have been inflicted on Libya, its people, and others living in Libya in recent months.\xc2\xa0 We send our condolences to the victims and their families, and to the people of Libya as they continue to fight back against terrorism.</p>\n<p>This latest terrorist attack underscores the need for all Libyan parties, including General National Congress members, to participate in the U.N.-led dialogue convened by Bernardino Le\xc3\xb3n, the Special Representative to the U.N. Secretary General, to form a national unity government.\xc2\xa0 Those who choose not to participate are excluding themselves from discussions which are critical to combatting terrorism, as well as to the overall peace, stability and security of Libya.</p>\n<p>The best way to counter these terrorists who are operating in Libya is to help the Libyan people build the national consensus that they need to fight these groups instead of each other.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, that is what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on, is that we have seen that violent extremists and terrorists have sought to use instability in one country or another to establish a safe haven.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what they have attempted to do in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what they had designs on doing in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that is why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the United States take pretty aggressive action in both of those places to counter their ability to establish a safe haven there.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re mindful, and have been for some time, of the ongoing insecurity and instability inside of Libya.\xc2\xa0 And we have been supportive of this U.N.-led dialogue to try to bring some more stability to that situation; and in doing so, it will enhance the ability of the central government to provide for the security of the Libyan people and ensure that radical extremists and terrorists are not able to use it as a safe haven to carry out attacks either against the Libyan people or against other people in the region.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re very mindful of the situation in Libya.\xc2\xa0 We obviously condemn in the strongest possible terms today\xe2\x80\x99s terrorist attacks.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a situation that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to monitor.\xc2\xa0 But while we do that, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to be supportive of the U.N.-led dialogue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just another one on Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The State Department said that the Russian-backed rebels have broken the ceasefire 250 times.\xc2\xa0 Are more sanctions now inevitable?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the United States does continue to be deeply troubled by ongoing military operations conducted by Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine, which have continued despite Russian and separatist commitments to an \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate and comprehensive ceasefire.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 This is a commitment that they reaffirmed in the February 12th Minsk Implementation Plan.</p>\n<p>Russia and the separatists it backs have acted in direct contravention of the Minsk Implementation Plan.\xc2\xa0 And we call on all the signatories to that document to carry out the commitments undertaken in the plan, and the September Minsk agreements, fully and without delay.\xc2\xa0 Despite these aggressive actions, we continue to support a negotiated solution to the crisis.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made repeatedly clear that President Putin has a choice.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also made it crystal clear that the longer that the Putin regime continues to refuse to abide by the commitments that they have made in the context of diplomatic negotiations, that the risk of higher costs will continue to increase.</p>\n<p>We have seen that the sanctions regime that\xe2\x80\x99s already been in place only tightens as time goes by, that Russia becomes further isolated.\xc2\xa0 And whether you evaluate the investment climate in Russia or the value of the currency, or future projections of economic growth, that Russia has taken a hit and that hit worsens as the weeks and months go by.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s the status quo, is that the impact of the sanctions regime is having more of a bite.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s also possible is that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that there could be additional costs over and above those increasing costs that could be imposed.\xc2\xa0 But any sorts of decisions like that will be made in coordination with our allies in Europe, and we have valued the kind of close cooperation we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten so far from our allies over there.\xc2\xa0 And that cooperation will continue in an effort to maximize the impact of these costs</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess my question is, if you\xe2\x80\x99re saying they\xe2\x80\x99ve broken the ceasefire 250 times, how many times do they have to break it before you say, okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re not thinking about this anymore, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to implement more sanctions?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate question.\xc2\xa0 And certainly as we see Russia fail to live up to those commitments -- and President Putin in particular fail to live up to those commitments -- it does put them at risk of facing even higher costs.\xc2\xa0 And the question has always been -- and this is a question that I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten in this room before -- has always been, at what point do the costs become sufficiently high that Russia and President Putin reevaluates his strategy for his country\xe2\x80\x99s actions in eastern Ukraine?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to watch.\xc2\xa0 And if the President determines in consultation with our allies in Europe that additional sanctions are needed and additional costs should be imposed, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll act in coordinated fashion to impose them.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jessica, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just going back to the Mosul attack briefing.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to be clear in your answer to Alexis:\xc2\xa0 Did you or did you not know that CENTCOM was doing a briefing with reporters?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as I explained to Alexis, I am not aware of all of the background briefings that are -- or even on-the-record briefings that are conducted all across the federal government on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there any effort by the White House to make coalition partners aware that CENTCOM would be discussing the operational details of the Mosul attack?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to confirm that the details that they cited are accurate, but there is a lot of intensive international coordination that actually goes on at CENTCOM.\xc2\xa0 Many of you will recall that when the President went to CENTCOM last fall, he met with representatives from other countries who are integrated with the efforts at CENTCOM.\xc2\xa0 And we take very seriously, and I know the Department of Defense takes very seriously the responsibility that they have to closely coordinate with our partners and allies who are part of this coalition.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to check with Central Command about whether or not they incorporated these foreign representatives either in that briefing, during the briefing, or in advance of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the White House role there to inform coalition partners on that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, not necessarily.\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about informing Qatar that they were going to be outed as a training site when they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been before?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that they were outed.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) before.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that Qatar wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready to announce it.\xc2\xa0 The President, however -- I guess this is a good segue to the week ahead.\xc2\xa0 The President will be hosting the --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I tee\xe2\x80\x99d it up for you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There you go, it was good.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President will host the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim, at the White House on Tuesday, February 24th.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to discussing with Sheikh Tamim political, economic, and security issues of mutual concern to our two countries.\xc2\xa0 The United States and Qatar have a longstanding partnership, and this meeting is an opportunity to further that relationship, along with our shared interest in supporting stability and prosperity in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m jumping ahead.\xc2\xa0 That meeting will occur Tuesday here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will meet with the National Governors Association.\xc2\xa0 In the afternoon, he\xe2\x80\x99ll participate in an ambassador credentialing ceremony in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 At this event, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past, the President will receive the credentials from foreign ambassadors recently posted in Washington.\xc2\xa0 The presentation of credentials is a traditional ceremony that marks the formal beginning of an ambassador service in Washington.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mentioned that on Tuesday the President will meet with Sheikh Tamim.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the President will travel to Miami, Florida to participate in an immigration town hall meeting hosted by Telemundo.\xc2\xa0 Further details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Florida will be made available in coming days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0 That evening, the President and First Lady will host a reception celebrating Black History Month in the East Room.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then on Friday, the President will welcome President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia to the White House.\xc2\xa0 President Sirleaf\xe2\x80\x99s visit comes at a time of critical cooperation between the United States and Liberia.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to building on a strong and historic partnership with Liberia and discussing a range of topics with President Sirleaf, including the ongoing Ebola response, the region\xe2\x80\x99s economic recovery plans, and other issues of mutual interest.</p>\n<p>With that, I hope you all have a tremendous weekend.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, are we going to get any readouts about calls to foreign leaders today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is a possibility of that, so stay tuned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be a veto event next week on Keystone?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If there is, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you get anything on the Ayatollah that I asked you about?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Actually, I did, so I\'m glad that you brought that up.\xc2\xa0 Let me get through this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What I was reminded of after our discussion on this topic on Wednesday is that the President on a couple of times has been asked this directly, and the President himself has said that he tends not to comment on communications that he has had with foreign leaders.\xc2\xa0 He has in the past acknowledged exchanging letters with the Supreme Leader.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But as I said on Wednesday, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new details to share with you.\xc2\xa0 The one thing I will say is that contrary to some recent reports, there has been no recent letter from either side.\xc2\xa0 Speaking more broadly about our policies vis-\xc3\xa0-vis Iran, our message both in private and in public has been consistent:\xc2\xa0 That the United States will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon and that we encourage them to engage constructively with the international community to resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>As you\xe2\x80\x99ve also heard us say, we\xe2\x80\x99ve raised significant concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for terror activities and other destabilizing activities in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 And we often, and even in the context of these letters, have raised concerns about Americans who are being held against their will, or are missing in Iran.\xc2\xa0 And those are things that we have said publicly many times, and that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the private messages that the President has communicated to the Supreme Leader in letters that they\xe2\x80\x99ve previously exchanged.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:28 P.M.
