(Local)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the Venus Room.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So let me talk a little bit about the afternoon events, particularly the meeting with Prime Minister Erdogan also the Patriarchate because I think you all saw -- I think this morning\xe2\x80\x99s events, the speech and so forth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with the Prime Minister, as you know we went to his home.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m told this is a rare occurrence.\xc2\xa0 He does not frequently receive official visitors there, if at all.\xc2\xa0 So it was incredibly gracious of the Prime Minister to receive us there.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe meeting was scheduled to last 45 minutes.\xc2\xa0 It lasted two hours.\xc2\xa0 But it began with the Prime Minister introducing the Vice President and the small group with him to his children and son-in-law -- son and daughter and son-in-law.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then we sat down.\xc2\xa0 I might add that we did remove our shoes and put on slippers before going into the house.\xc2\xa0 And the Prime Minister began by -- I don\'t want to really characterize what he said, the only I will say to that is he told the Vice President that he had watched his speech this morning and complimented it and expressed appreciation for the very positive remarks that the Vice President made about the relationship between the United States and Turkey and the tremendous development that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s economy, as well as in our relationship, overall, steps at the start of the meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then the Prime Minister asked the Vice President if he would talk to him about our trip to Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And I would say they spent about half of the meeting talking about Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President gave them a very detailed readout of the trip, his meetings, the key take-aways.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the main points that the Vice President conveyed were these:\xc2\xa0 One, we the United States are not disengaging from Iraq.\xc2\xa0 This will be a familiar story to most of you.\xc2\xa0 To the contrary our engagement in many ways will be increasing through the strategic framework agreement.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Vice President went into some detail about the workings of the Higher Coordination Committee and the work we\xe2\x80\x99d be doing with the Iraqis through the Higher Coordination Committee of the Strategic Framework Agreement.\xc2\xa0 And he explained that again it\xe2\x80\x99s really the nature of our engagement that\'s changed in Iraq from the military lead to a civilian lead.\xc2\xa0 But the Vice President emphasized that we are determined to be engaged and it\xe2\x80\x99s just as important that the Iraqis are extremely desirous of our engagement as evidenced by the Prime Minister hosting the meeting of the Higher Coordination Council.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey discussed the role of Iran in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President again expressed his conviction which you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk about that Iranian influence in Iraq is very much overstated, that the Iraqis do not appreciate outside meddling or interference from anyone, starting with Iran.\xc2\xa0 That, of course, there was going to be a relationship.\xc2\xa0 They shared a long border and history, and that was perfectly normal.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of negatively influencing Iraq or acting in any kind of malicious fashion there are very strong Iraqi antibodies to that kind of influence or interference.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe also talked about the PKK.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President made clear our absolute commitment to work closely with Turkey to deal with the serious threat proposed by PKK terrorism.\xc2\xa0 He also relayed that we heard from the Iraqis that they too -- including the Kurdish leadership, that they too were serious about dealing with this problem, a common problem to Turkey, the United States and Iraq.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that was the bulk of the discussion on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 There was also a discussion of Iran more generally.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President made the case that in our estimation Iranian influence is declining and Iranian isolation is increasing in the region.\xc2\xa0 And again, some of you heard him talk about this before.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe ran through -- the Vice President ran through the litany of recent outrageous acts by Iran that we believe are further isolating the Iranian regime:\xc2\xa0 thumbing their nose at the nonproliferation treaty and their obligations to the international community on the nuclear program; the assault on the British embassy; the assassination attempt by -- I should say plot -- on the Saudi ambassador in Washington.\xc2\xa0 All of these things were putting Iran in increasing isolation in the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Vice President noted that President Obama and our administration had made serious efforts at outreach to Iran early in the administration that were not reciprocated.\xc2\xa0 These were necessary also to demonstrate to the world that we were serious about resolving the problems that the international community has with Iran diplomatically, and we still are.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that the world had seen that outreach and that effort had reversed what had been a problem in the past, which was the United States being isolated instead of Iran because of the perception that we were not trying to engage them.\xc2\xa0 And the result has been the strongest coalition in recent memory internationally to put pressure on Iran.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Vice President further made the case that we need to sustain the pressure on Iran.\xc2\xa0 And -- sorry -- and that this was the most likely way to actually modify their behavior.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey briefly discussed Syria as well.\xc2\xa0 And there the conviction expressed by the Vice President that President Asad and people around him are the source of the problem and instability because they\'re killing their own people, and there was clearly a growing international consensus that Asad needed to leave.\xc2\xa0 And of course, the Turks have been in the lead on forging that consensus.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Vice President raised Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Israel.\xc2\xa0 He expressed our hope that both Turks and Israelis would look for opportunities to strengthen their relationship and to get over the recent tensions.\xc2\xa0 He repeated what he said to President Gul that it pains us to see two of our closest friends and partners not getting along so well, and that we would continue to encourage both to look for opportunities to strengthen their relationship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThen there was a brief discussion of a number of issues:\xc2\xa0 the Egyptian elections, Libya, the Balkans, Kosovo and Bosnia, and then finally the Vice President raised two final issues with the Prime Minister, first, Cyprus and the Halki seminary.\xc2\xa0 On Cyprus, the Vice President expressed the hope that we would see real progress in the negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations and Ban Ki-moon, and that we remain ready to do what we can to encourage progress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Halki, the Vice President expressed our hope that the seminary would be reopened and praised the steps that the Prime Minister has taken in terms of the restitution of property in recent months.\xc2\xa0 These were very important steps forward.\xc2\xa0 And he also praised the constitutional reform process, including the hope that he had heard speaking to the Speaker that this would only further enhance religious freedom in Turkey.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then finally on Armenia, he said to the Prime Minister what he had raised with President Gul, as well, the hope that now that the protocols for normalization were back on the agenda of the parliament that Turkey would be able to move on those protocols in the months ahead.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think that was it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the Vice President in the context of saying we need to sustain the pressure on Iran encourage or urge the Prime Minister to have Turkey participate in further sanctions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 They didn\'t get -- there was not specific discussion of sanctions other than the -- to say that the Vice President noted that clearly the sanctions were having a demonstrable impact on Iran, and again, the best way to change their behavior and have them come in to -- to respect international norms instead of flaunt them was to sustain that pressure, but that was the extent of the discussion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did it -- just so I\xe2\x80\x99m very clear on it, would it be fair for us to interpret his strong endorsement of sanctions -- and given Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s role as a country that could be very valuable in such a regard -- that there was clearly a message?\xc2\xa0 Gee, we think sanctions are a good thing, be great if you were a part of them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say we don\'t think sanctions are a good thing, we think unfortunately they\'re a necessary thing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right -- of an effective thing in this context.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 And that they\'re having an impact, and certainly Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s participation -- indeed, they have participated in sanctions -- is an important part of that.\xc2\xa0 But he didn\'t say anything beyond that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, did you talk about what would come next?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No, not in this conversation just the conviction that Asad needs to leave and the killing of the Syrian people needs to stop.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to the reporting that the Syria leader in exile says that a new regime would fundamentally change their relationship and support Hezbollah?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those reports, so I really don\'t have a response to that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us -- the Vice President seemed to be very pointed in the opening part of his remarks today at the summit.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us about --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 He did in what -- about what way?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, he seemed to be almost responding to some of the things that the Foreign Minister had said in his remarks about Europe and the West in general?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No, I -- I don\'t think --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that was all planned in his speech?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it was.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He didn\'t add anything at the last minute?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 There was nothing --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s talking about the top of the speech where he said -- we are -- our economy is three times the size of any other --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes, the very beginning.\xc2\xa0 Actually --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to talk about the American economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 No, I actually -- I didn\'t talk to him about that so I don\'t know what exactly he was thinking about because I think -- this is speculation -- that because other speakers had been talking about their economies, he wanted to make clear that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the focus of his speech but he wanted to say -- get in a few words nonetheless -- but I don\'t know the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that was added?\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the original?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think that was -- yes, I believe that was added.\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the text.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 You should ask him.\xc2\xa0 You should ask him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With regards to the discussion of Iraq, were the uses for the Predators discussed?\xc2\xa0 Because they\'re stationed in Incirlik now, but would they be used for striking?\xc2\xa0 And was there anything that the VP communicated to the Prime Minister about Turkish incursions into northern Iraq and air strikes against PKK camps?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go into any more detail than I went into other than to say that the Vice President said the United States was committed to help Turkey deal with the problem.\xc2\xa0 He also said that of course, sovereignty is very important to Iraq, and that obviously the most -- one of the most important things that could happen would be for the Iraqis both at the national level, but particularly the Kurdish regional government to take whatever steps they could take to crack down on the PKK.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tExcuse me one second.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t(Interruption to proceedings.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Parting shots as we go out the door?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Email me if you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you describe -- just very briefly on Israel, you made it sound like almost you spoke in sorry rather than anger, it pains us to see two friends not getting along.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, certainly that\'s not in anger.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he didn\'t -- but he didn\'t sort of say, look, you got to fix this.\xc2\xa0 It was more, gee, we --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99re not in a position to say that.\xc2\xa0 It was -- again, it was more -- we\xe2\x80\x99re here.\xc2\xa0 We have two very close friends and partners who are now experiencing some tension in their relationship and just want to see if we can be helpful.\xc2\xa0 We intend to be, but mostly we\xe2\x80\x99re saying the same thing to the Israelis, we hope you look for every opportunity to strengthen the relationship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, there have been steps taken in recent months in terms of the earthquake, in terms of Gilad Shalit, other things where they\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously taken some positive steps forward.\xc2\xa0 But we ideally want to see them get back to a fully normal relationship, and very positive relationship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, the buffer zone -- you didn\'t ask about that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I know that\xe2\x80\x99s your favorite question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I know -- look, I have my one obsession.\xc2\xa0 It didn\'t come up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 It didn\'t come up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How was his health?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean just did he seem --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 He seemed fine.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he moving around okay?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Standing up okay, sitting down?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not a medical doctor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, but you saw him stand up and sit down.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Hey, I -- stand up, greeted us at the door, walked us to the driveway.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because nobody has seen him move.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 He --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nobody else who isn\xe2\x80\x99t a Turkish government official.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 They got the photos out there --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he -- as a non-expert opinion, I watch \xe2\x80\x9cE.R.\xe2\x80\x9d on television, but that\'s about the extent of it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I can say he looked very well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 And just to clarify it was you and the Ambassador?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Me and the ambassador and Anthony Godfrey from the National Security Staff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, if I may, one more question on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 If Turkish airstrikes continue, will it be problematic with the U.S. withdrawal in terms of --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 What striking --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If Turkish airstrikes and land incursions into northern Iraq continue will it be problematic in terms of stability with Iraq because the national government and the regional government have differing opinions about Turkish incursions into the region?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Look, if the -- it\xe2\x80\x99s in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s interest -- the national government, the Kurdish region and the Turks -- for the PKK problem to be handled effectively in a way that does not cause further violence against Turks, but also doesn\'t lead to other problems.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have the Iraqis said anything concrete as to the steps they can take to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 They told us that they were committed to dealing with the problem.\xc2\xa0 All right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t6:55 P.M.
