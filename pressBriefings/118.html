Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:06 P.M. EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you all. \xc2\xa0Welcome back from California, those of you who traveled with the President. \xc2\xa0Let me do one quick announcement before we get started -- it\'s an update to the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tToday, the President is appointing Tom Donilon, former National Security Advisor, to serve as the chair of the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s also appointing Sam Palmisano, former CEO of IBM, to serve as vice chair. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President announced the establishment of this commission on February 9th, as part of his Cybersecurity National Action Plan. \xc2\xa0That plan was the capstone of more than seven years of determined effort by this administration, building upon lessons learned from cybersecurity trends, threats and intrusions. \xc2\xa0The National Action Plan directs the federal government to take new action now and fosters the conditions required for long-term improvements in our approach to cybersecurity across the federal government, the private sector, and the personal lives of the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThese appointees have experienced the challenges presented by today\xe2\x80\x99s digital economy from different perspectives -- Tom Donilon from the threats that cyber presents to our national security and how it impacts our broader strategy on the global stage, and Mr. Palmisano from the challenges cybersecurity presents to American companies and their places of global leadership. \xc2\xa0The President expects both of these men to bring their experiences to bear and set the country on a path to ensuring cybersecurity over the next decade. \xc2\xa0The President has the highest confidence in these men being able to deliver on the critical task of providing the country a series of detailed recommendations on actions that can be taken over the next decade to enhance cybersecurity. \xc2\xa0The commission that they will chair will report to the President with its specific findings and recommendations before the end of this year. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will meet with these two individuals in the Oval Office later this afternoon. \xc2\xa0At the conclusion of that meeting, we\'ll allow the pool in to come take a picture and hear the President talk briefly about the meeting he convened with them today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What time is that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think we\'re looking in the three o\xe2\x80\x99clock hour today. \xc2\xa0But we\'ll have some more details coming shortly. \xc2\xa0We\'re going to try and get up the updated guidance in the midst of this briefing, so as soon as we get that together, you can look at that in your inbox.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that important piece of news out of the way, Josh, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Senator Grassley and, just in the past couple hours, Senator Cornyn have suggested that they are -- the door could be open to possibly having a hearing on the President\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court nominee that he chooses. \xc2\xa0Coming off of what we\'ve heard McConnell and the Republicans say earlier, do you see Republicans coming around on this issue?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think Republicans will speak for themselves in terms of what their position is. \xc2\xa0We certainly know what the Constitution says what their position should be, and that is, when there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, it\'s the responsibility of the President of the United States to nominate someone to fill that vacancy and it\'s the responsibility of the United States Senate, as an institution, to give that individual a fair hearing and a timely vote. \xc2\xa0And we certainly would expect this Senate to do it -- primarily because the Constitution of the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include any specific exceptions for an election year. \xc2\xa0The President is here to do his job, and the Senate should do theirs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess what I\'m asking is, the White House has been deeply engaged in talking with members of Congress about this process and that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to see a vote. \xc2\xa0Do you feel like you\'re making any headway in those discussions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, the positions that Republicans are going to express, I\'ll let them decide whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that. \xc2\xa0It is clear what the Constitution expects of them. \xc2\xa0It\'s also, I think, pretty clear what the American people expect of them. \xc2\xa0The American people show up and do their job every day. \xc2\xa0They don\'t take days off just because they\xe2\x80\x99ve got some other big meeting around the corner. \xc2\xa0And I think the American people expect that the Senate is going to show up and do their job, even though they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a big election around the corner.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President plan to travel to the Court on Friday when Justice Scalia will lie in repose, or to attend the funeral on Saturday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Josh, you apparently have very good sources here in the West Wing. \xc2\xa0I\'ll give you a couple of updates on this. \xc2\xa0The President and the First Lady, on Friday, will travel to the Supreme Court to pay their respects to Justice Scalia as he lies in repose there at the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that Vice President Biden and Dr. Jill Biden will attend Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s funeral at the Basilica on Saturday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President will not be at the funeral on Saturday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President will pay his respects at the Supreme Court on Friday, and he\'ll be joined with the First Lady when he does that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, there\xe2\x80\x99s a school of thought out there that says that if the White House looks and sees that your realistic prospects for getting a nominee confirmed are nil that it makes more sense to pick a nominee that would make more of a splash politically and could rile up Democrats when Republicans inevitably oppose it. \xc2\xa0How does the White House view that line of argument?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now, Josh, is fulfilling the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional duty to nominate someone to fill the vacancy at the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what the Constitution requires. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President and his team are focused on doing. \xc2\xa0As the President pointed out, there is ample time for him to make that decision and for the Senate to fulfill their constitutional responsibility to give that individual a fair hearing and a timely vote, and for that individual to ascend to the Supreme Court.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are a lot of ways to slice and dice this, and I anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll spend some time in the weeks and months ahead taking a look at these statistics. \xc2\xa0But it would be virtually unprecedented for there to be a vacancy -- certainly unprecedented in the modern era -- for there to be a vacancy on the Supreme Court that would interfere with two different Supreme Court terms. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what would happen if this Senate didn\xe2\x80\x99t fulfill the constitutional responsibility.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re focused right now on what the Constitution requires of the President. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in a process, and there\xe2\x80\x99s ample time but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to move expeditiously to work through this process and choose -- put forward the person that the President best believes can fulfill the responsibilities that come with a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on one other issue, there\xe2\x80\x99s a dispute between Apple and the FBI over a magistrate judge\xe2\x80\x99s order that they allow the FBI to access the cell phone used in relation to the San Bernardino shooting. \xc2\xa0Does the White House want Apple to comply with that order?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, this is directly related to the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing investigation of the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, and this is an investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s being conducted by independent law enforcement officers. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve made a case to the court that this telephone, this iPhone that was owned by the San Bernardino Department of Public Health, but was used by one of the terrorists, that they should have access to that phone and that Apple should disable the auto-erase security feature on the phone. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the case that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made to the court, and the court issued their ruling saying that -- issued a ruling indicating its agreement.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, for questions about whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate, or what additional steps the Department of Justice will take if Apple chooses to appeal the ruling, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice and to the FBI because they\xe2\x80\x99re leading the investigation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it plays directly into this broader issue of cybersecurity that Tom Donilon and others are focusing on, and the broader concept of whether tech companies should be forced to allow this kind of access to their products for law enforcement, despite encryption. \xc2\xa0So, in general, do you think that -- does the White House think that the FBI should be able to access that kind of information?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think it is important to note here, Josh, exactly what the Department of Justice is requesting. \xc2\xa0They are not asking Apple to redesign its product or to create a new backdoor to one of their products. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re simply asking for something that would have an impact on this one device. \xc2\xa0And again, for the merits of that arguments and why the Department of Justice has concluded that that\xe2\x80\x99s important, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously, the Department of Justice and the FBI can count on the full support of the White House as they conduct an investigation to learn as much as they possibly can about this particular incident. \xc2\xa0 The President certainly believes that that is an important national priority. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately the responsibility of these independent law enforcement professionals to do that, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAyesha.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Going back to the Supreme Court, yesterday the President was asked about the possibility of using a recess appointment if the Republicans refuse to consider your nominee. \xc2\xa0He didn\xe2\x80\x99t explicitly rule it out. \xc2\xa0Can you say right now, has the White House ruled out the possibility of using a recess appointment? \xc2\xa0Is that totally off the table? \xc2\xa0And then also, has there been any specific outreach from the White House to Senate Republicans in terms of the Supreme Court nomination?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Ayesha, the President was asked this direct question yesterday, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to his answer. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think we have more than enough time to go through regular order and the regular processes. \xc2\xa0I intend to nominate somebody, to present them to the American people, to present them to the Senate. \xc2\xa0I expect them to hold hearings and I expect there to be a vote.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0So I think the President was pretty direct about what his plans are, and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to it beyond what he said.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs Josh pointed out, the White House officials have been in touch with Senate offices about this vacancy and about the process that has now been initiated under the Constitution to fill that vacancy. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch with both parties on this question. \xc2\xa0And I would anticipate that there will be more conversations in the days ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you say who you\xe2\x80\x99ve reached out to?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list in front of me. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get into sort of the details about who precisely we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch with, but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly been multiple offices in both parties.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In the South China Sea, China has deployed [an] advanced surface-to-air missile system for a disputed island in the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0The U.S. has repeatedly called for China to stop the militarization of that area, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like that\xe2\x80\x99s happening. \xc2\xa0Is the U.S. planning to take any additional action, any additional steps to kind of address these actions that keep happening on the part of China?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the commercial imagery that seems to indicate that China has deployed a surface-to-air missile system on a disputed outpost in the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0I think that, frankly, the announcement yesterday in the form of the Sunnylands declaration that was signed by the leaders of the ASEAN countries who met with the President earlier this week is significant. \xc2\xa0It reflects years of persistent diplomacy on the part of the United States, and it commits all of the signatories to maintaining \xe2\x80\x9cpeace, security and stability in the region, ensuring maritime security and safety.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0It goes on to say that that includes \xe2\x80\x9cunimpeded lawful maritime commerce\xe2\x80\x9d as described by the U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea, as well as non-militarization and self-restraint in the conduct of activities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty direct commitment by the leaders of ASEAN to this principle. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s why we continue to urge all claimants \xc2\xa0-- the United States is not one of them -- but we continue to urge all claimants to clarify their territorial and maritime claims in accordance with international law, and to commit to peacefully manage and resolve these disputes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe concern -- the U.S. interest is not in particular claims on any of the land features, but rather in the continued free flow of commerce in this region of the world that has significant consequences for the global economy and significant consequences for the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have maintained that this is something that should be resolved peacefully among the claimants. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt the same time, the United States military has undertaken operations to indicate our view and to, I think in pretty stark terms, make clear our view that we intend to continue to fly, sail, and operate anywhere that international law allows. \xc2\xa0And our commitment to that principle is quite firm. \xc2\xa0And we certainly welcomed this commitment from the leaders of ASEAN that was produced in California just yesterday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it seem that the China action seems to fly in the face of that commitment?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, China did not sign the Sunnylands declaration. \xc2\xa0And I think this is an indication, though, that the 10 or so countries in Southeast Asia who also have claims in that region of the world are committed to the approach that we have advocated, which is the peaceful resolution of these disputes in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t ramp up the military presence or military capabilities that are located in these disputed territories.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMary.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0Has the President begun reviewing a short list yet? \xc2\xa0Has he started conducting interviews?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Mary, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be able to provide a lot of details about this process. \xc2\xa0And that may be a source of some frustration for all of us I think in the weeks ahead. \xc2\xa0Where we\xe2\x80\x99re able to provide some insight of that process I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to come prepared to do that. \xc2\xa0Today is not one of those days, unfortunately. \xc2\xa0I can confirm for you that the President and his team take this process very seriously, and understand that while there\xe2\x80\x99s ample time, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to move expeditiously to fulfill the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional responsibilities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that process generally has begun, but exactly where we are in that process and what the President is reviewing at this point is not something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be prepared to discuss publicly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And back on Apple and the FBI investigation. \xc2\xa0I know you said that the FBI isn\xe2\x80\x99t asking to open any kind of backdoor here, but critics certainly are concerned that this could be a slippery slope -- Apple, for one. \xc2\xa0Does the President share these concerns at all?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to weigh in on the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on this particular case. \xc2\xa0Again, this is a case that is being investigated by independent law enforcement officials at the FBI. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the President\xe2\x80\x99s view when it comes to encryption and protecting privacy. \xc2\xa0The President believes in robust and strong encryption. \xc2\xa0He believes in the principle of protecting the privacy and civil liberties of the American people. \xc2\xa0But, again, for the reasons that I outlined before, the question that is being debated in this particular proceeding is different than that because we\xe2\x80\x99re not asking Apple to redesign its products or to create a new backdoor to its products. \xc2\xa0This is a much more specific request that the Department of Justice has put forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one follow-up to what the President said yesterday. \xc2\xa0He said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think Trump will be President because he has faith in the American people. \xc2\xa0He said they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty sensible. \xc2\xa0Is he suggesting that Trump supporters aren\xe2\x80\x99t sensible?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President was just sort of making an observation about the process. \xc2\xa0And I know that there has been a back-and-forth here between the President and Mr. Trump, and I\'m not sure I make that a whole lot more interesting by weighing in myself.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I want to go back to the list -- the Supreme Court list. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s different now than before when it comes to the list and the process, beyond the obvious?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The obvious being that there is now a vacancy at the Supreme Court?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, beyond the obvious that Republicans are screaming about this with this supposedly short window -- well, it is 11 months, but they\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s a short window and he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s different about this process than the times before?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The irony is, is I don\xe2\x80\x99t even think Republicans are suggesting that it\xe2\x80\x99s a short window. \xc2\xa0I think that would be a very tough case to make. \xc2\xa0The reason that would be a tough case to make is the President will be in office for almost a year, and the average time that it has taken to confirm someone who has been nominated to be a Supreme Court justice over the last 40 years or so is 67 days. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why you continue to hear me and the President indicate that there is ample time for this to get done. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the argument that Republicans are making is one that\xe2\x80\x99s rooted in the observation that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made that this is a presidential election year. \xc2\xa0Of course, there is a precedent for nominees being confirmed in a presidential election year -- that occurred in 1988, when then-President Reagan nominated, and Senate Democrats confirmed, Justice Kennedy in early 1988 to move to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s a precedent here. \xc2\xa0More importantly, there\xe2\x80\x99s a constitutional responsibility here. \xc2\xa0The President is going to fulfill his constitutional responsibility. \xc2\xa0The Senate should fulfill their constitutional responsibility. \xc2\xa0And if there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt, then they should go back and check. \xc2\xa0They will find that there is no exception written into the Constitution about filling a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0So with that, is the President feeling any pressure with this last -- well, with this Supreme Court nomination or appointment? \xc2\xa0Is he feeling pressure about who he has to appoint -- a minority, a woman, what have you? \xc2\xa0Because it\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing it from all sectors.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the President takes this process quite seriously. \xc2\xa0And certainly this is one of the most important decisions that any President makes -- a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land is a weighty proposition, and these are the kinds of tough decisions that the American people expect their President to make. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not one that President Obama takes lightly, and you can anticipate that there will be a rigorous process to ensure that the nominee is who the President believes is the best person to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But does the best person have to be someone who is able to be confirmed -- does that best person have to be someone who is middle-of-the-road, or is he going to take a chance and make them more liberal than the middle-of-the-road?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President was clear yesterday that he would appoint someone whose credentials for the job were indisputable. \xc2\xa0And, ultimately, that is the question that the Senate will have to ask, as the President said yesterday -- is this an individual who can serve on the Court with honor and distinction. \xc2\xa0And that will certainly be part of the criteria that the President includes in choosing who is nominee should be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are the old lists in play?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are the old lists from the potentials in play right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me say it this way: \xc2\xa0Just because people have been considered before doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they can\xe2\x80\x99t be considered again. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hmm. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Thank you very much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Did I surprise you with that one? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, but thank you for offering that nugget.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m doing my best.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, lastly, going back to my initial question about the timing and people saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s just not enough time, and you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about he has ample time and the precedent, and just on the time issue, this might be kind of strange, but is the President\xe2\x80\x99s last day January 20, 2017 or January 19, 2017?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My understanding -- Mark can correct me here because he has presided over a lot of these -- it\xe2\x80\x99s at noon on January 20, 2017 in which the changeover in power occurs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So even though the 45th President will take the official oath of office quietly before the actual ceremonial oath, it\xe2\x80\x99s not until the 20th?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, remember when Obama -- President Obama did the first? \xc2\xa0Remember when he did the first?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It was a Sunday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So there are two different situations here. \xc2\xa0In 2009, the President first took the oath of office that was administered by Chief Justice Roberts in front of a large crowd that was gathered on the National Mall, and that was the first time that the President took the oath of office. \xc2\xa0There was the highly publicized verbal slip that occurred, and so a day later the Chief Justice came to the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn 2013, when the President took the oath of office, Inauguration Day fell on a Sunday, and so the President had a small ceremony here at the White House to take the oath of office, again, administered by the Chief Justice. \xc2\xa0But even that was done here at the White House, in front of the pool, and was televised on live television. \xc2\xa0So I would not envision a scenario at this point that anybody would secretly take the oath of office. \xc2\xa0I think that certainly wound undermine the kind of transparency we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about a lot in here over the last seven years, to say it mildly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So he is President until noon --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Until noon on January 20, 2017.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Two questions. \xc2\xa0One, on the argument that the President has been making about it being a constitutional responsibility for the Senate to do hearings and vote, Republicans are arguing that that\xe2\x80\x99s a false choice; that, in fact, they only have to advise and consent, and should they not hold hearings and they\xe2\x80\x99re not consenting, then they\xe2\x80\x99ve lived up to their responsibility. \xc2\xa0My question is, how does the administration respond to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s actually pretty clear that the Senate has a responsibility to offer their advice and consent on a nominee from the President of the United States. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a well-established process for offering that advice and consent. \xc2\xa0It is to give that individual a fair hearing and to give them a timely up or down vote. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s happened for centuries. \xc2\xa0And the reason it\xe2\x80\x99s happened for centuries is not just a coincidence. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s because that is consistent with the requirements of the United States Constitution, and the long, deeply held traditions of the United States Senate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But their argument is, constitutionally, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do any of those things -- that they can just not consent, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do any hearings and they\xe2\x80\x99ve done their job. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think it violates the -- it certainly is inconsistent with the Constitution for the United States Senate to basically say the President shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t nominate someone, which I actually believe was the language that has been used by many Republicans who have commented on this. \xc2\xa0That is inconsistent with the Constitution. \xc2\xa0And it ignores the responsibility that the United States Senate has, as an institution, to consider that nominee and offer their advice and consent. \xc2\xa0Their failure to do so is inconsistent with the Constitution, but also inconsistent with the expectations of the American people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, they are in office until January 3, 2017, I believe, but they should do their job in the meantime. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody would suggest that somehow they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a responsibility to show up for work just because it\xe2\x80\x99s an election year. \xc2\xa0In fact, I think that there are some members of the United States Senate on the Republican side that have been criticized for not showing up for work in an election year. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them sort of debate that back-and-forth. \xc2\xa0But I do think it illustrates that the Senate has a job to do, and the American people certainly would expect them to do it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And why should the American people side with the President\xe2\x80\x99s point of view here that the Senate should get to work when, as a senator himself, he filibustered Justice Alito?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, again, I think I would draw an important distinction here. \xc2\xa0There is a difference between the President\xe2\x80\x99s symbolic vote against President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court nominee and Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 reflexive opposition to the idea of President Obama even nominating anybody to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0So there is a pretty stark difference here. \xc2\xa0And what Republicans are advocating is wrong and is inconsistent with the requirements of the Constitution, primarily because the wording of the Constitution is unambiguous and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t provide an exception for election years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So if they bring it up and filibuster it, that would be consistent and okay?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, so let me keep going here, which is that in 2006, when the President was talking about his filibuster vote at the time, he noted that the filibuster effort was not likely to succeed and that then Judge Alito was likely to be confirmed, and that reflects the responsibility of the institution of the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNo party is solely responsible for the way that this process has become so politicized in recent years. \xc2\xa0And the point is that there\xe2\x80\x99s an institutional responsibility that Republicans have. \xc2\xa0They spent years fighting, scratching and clawing to win the majority in the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve talked at some length about how that comes with a certain set of responsibilities. \xc2\xa0It comes with the responsibility to pass a budget. \xc2\xa0It comes with the responsibility to raise the debt ceiling. \xc2\xa0It also comes with the responsibility to offer advice and consent on the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. \xc2\xa0And that\'s the expectation that we have.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, look, as the President alluded to yesterday, he regrets the vote that he made because, frankly, as we\'ve discussed, Democrats should have been in the position where they were making a public case. \xc2\xa0That\'s what Democrats should have done. \xc2\xa0And they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have looked for a way to just throw sand in the gears of the process. \xc2\xa0And, frankly, looking back on it, the President believes that he should have just followed his own advice and made a strong public case on the merits about his opposition to the nomination that President Bush had put forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So does this count?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What do you mean?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If you believe that -- if the President now believes that he should have made a public case and now he did not, the Republicans are not making a public case and they\xe2\x80\x99re just saying, we\'re not going to take it up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think these are two different things. \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s objections to then-President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s nominee were based in substance. \xc2\xa0The President considered the qualifications and worldview and credentials and record of the individual that President Bush put forward, and then-Senator Obama raised some substantive objections. \xc2\xa0And what the President regrets is that Senate Democrats didn\xe2\x80\x99t focus more on making an effective public case about those substantive objections. \xc2\xa0Instead, some Democrats engaged in a process of throwing sand in the gears of the confirmation process, and that\'s an approach that the President regrets.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, again, he alluded to this yesterday that there\xe2\x80\x99s no one party that is responsible for the way this has become politicized, and the President, yesterday, acknowledged his role in that. \xc2\xa0And so the question is, how, as an institution -- knowing that these politics are going to continue -- how, as an institution is the United States Senate going to confront their responsibility? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are still going to be pressures -- there are members of the United States Senate who are running for president, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be particular political pressures on them. \xc2\xa0That\'s not going to change. \xc2\xa0The question really is, what is the institution of the United States Senate going to do to make sure that the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities are fulfilled under the United States Constitution? \xc2\xa0And that\'s a difficult question, but it certainly is a direct question that is facing those Republicans who worked hard to get the majority of the Senate so that they could be in control of the United States Senate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey faced that question when deciding whether or not to shut down the government over Planned Parenthood. \xc2\xa0They faced that question in trying to determine whether or not they should raise the debt ceiling. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99re going to face this question now about how they fulfill their constitutional obligation to give the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to the Supreme Court a fair hearing and a timely up or down vote. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPam.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to clarify, on Friday, Josh, is the President attending that private ceremony that they\xe2\x80\x99re having at the Court on Friday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\'ll have more details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to the Supreme Court on Friday. \xc2\xa0But it will be an opportunity for the President and the First Lady to pay their respects to Justice Scalia, who will be lying in repose at the Supreme Court on Friday. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Given the fact that Ted Cruz is saying that he will filibuster any nominee, would you agree that it\'s an uphill battle for the President to get a justice approved?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think just looking at the math, you would know, given the fact that Republicans are in the majority in the United States Senate and given that the President of the United States is a Democrat, it means that the President is going to have to make a case -- a compelling case for a well-qualified nominee. \xc2\xa0And our expectation of Republicans in the Senate in 2016 is the same expectation that President Reagan had of Senate Democrats in 1988, which is that they would fairly consider a well-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the Senate Democrats in 1988 certainly upheld their constitutional responsibility, even in an election year, to confirm the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And we have the same expectations, and I think the American people have the same expectations, of Senate Republicans here in 2016.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy, will it? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think as I\xe2\x80\x99ve observed on many occasions, even the straightforward, noncontroversial things are not easy when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about this Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And speaking of that, given the rancor and venom that the President talked about, the atmosphere in Washington now, do you think that that will scare off any potential candidates who might not want to go through that kind of a process?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- my guess is no, primarily because the kind of individuals who would make good Supreme Court justices are individuals who have a thick skin, who understand that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a responsibility to defend their positions and their ideas in public as they go through a rigorous vetting process. \xc2\xa0That standard has been in place for quite some time, and so anybody who is signing up for this duty is not going to be surprised.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCheryl.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99ll just ask directly -- is Attorney General Loretta Lynch on the list to be considered as a nominee?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, she appears to be on the list of many of you. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details at this point to share about a list that\xe2\x80\x99s maintained by the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And can you define any better \xe2\x80\x9cdue time\xe2\x80\x9d? \xc2\xa0Is that weeks? \xc2\xa0Is that months?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0In terms of the President putting forward a nominee? \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific time frame to lay out for you. I think the best I can do is to remind you that when two Supreme Court vacancies occurred earlier in this presidency, the President put forward two well-qualified nominees after spending about a month or so deciding on who that should be. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the time frame will be different this time around, but the recent history here at least seems relevant.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKelly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Two things. \xc2\xa0First on the Court, following up on Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question, would the President consider the fact that a nominee would be subjected to a lot of scrutiny and might not ever rise to be a part of the Supreme Court, and that could be damaging to a career if you were put through that process and don\xe2\x80\x99t become a part of the Court?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually -- just in terms of the coverage of this, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen people sort of speculate this both ways -- that there are some people who say, well, after going through this process and getting beat up by Republicans and facing unreasonable partisan opposition, that that could have a negative impact on somebody\xe2\x80\x99s longer-term career prospects. \xc2\xa0On the other hand, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some people observe that running into that wall of unreasonable partisan obstruction from Republicans only serves to elevate the credentials of this individual and could eventually turn them into a cause c\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8bre even on the campaign trail. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou can imagine a Democratic nominee running around out there saying, you saw how well so-and-so performed in the confirmation hearings; elect me President and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get them on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo you can imagine how this plays out both ways. \xc2\xa0I think what the President is focused on right now is making sure that he puts forward the person that he believes would be the best person to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And today, New York officials are expressing a lot of concern about cuts to funding that they would use for counterterrorism measures. \xc2\xa0The Mayor is speaking out; Senator Schumer; the Police Commissioner. \xc2\xa0Would there be any change in the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view on reallocating that money for terrorism use by New York when we\xe2\x80\x99re in a constant threat environment?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This administration\xe2\x80\x99s investment in making sure that communities across the country, including New York, to fight terrorism and to protect the homeland are ironclad. \xc2\xa0And I think all you have to do is take a look at the numbers to indicate that this administration is serious about its commitment to homeland security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRight now in the DHS funding that is provided to New York, there is $600 million that\xe2\x80\x99s sitting in that account. \xc2\xa0And what this administration has proposed to do is to put another $255 million or so into that account this year. \xc2\xa0This year\xe2\x80\x99s contribution into that account is almost twice as much as New York officials have spent out of that account over the last two years combined. \xc2\xa0So there are ample resources that are available, and those ample resources are available and provided by the Obama administration because of our ironclad commitment to the safety and security of New York and communities all across the country.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would point out that the amount of funding that is devoted to protecting New York and making sure that law enforcement officials in New York have the resources that they need is higher than the amount of money that\xe2\x80\x99s provided to local communities across the country. \xc2\xa0We understand that New York is the largest city in the country. \xc2\xa0We understand that New York certainly is a high-profile target of terrorists. \xc2\xa0That would explain precisely the kind of commitment that this administration has made to homeland security in New York. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI will also just say that, at some point, Senator Schumer\xe2\x80\x99s credibility in talking about national security issues, particularly when the facts are as they are when it relates to homeland security, have to be affected by the position that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken on other issues. \xc2\xa0Senator Schumer is somebody that came out and opposed the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0He was wrong about that position, and most of his Democrats disagreed with him in taking that position. \xc2\xa0And when people look at the facts here when it comes to funding for homeland security, they\xe2\x80\x99ll recognize that he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong this time, too.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Wow! \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I understand the President was unhappy with Senator Schumer\xe2\x80\x99s position on that, but has the White House failed to properly -- given that context to New York officials, including Mayor de Blasio and the Police Commissioner, that they have such a different view of how the funding is being apportioned? \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This information has been provided to New York officials. \xc2\xa0I understand that the news conference that they convened today as part of basically an annual event -- but apparently, in this case, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t let the facts of the matter have an impact on the scheduling of this year\xe2\x80\x99s event.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the Scalia funeral, will Vice President Biden be delivering a eulogy on Saturday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know all of the details about Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the funeral on Saturday. \xc2\xa0But as we have more details, we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And back on recess appointments, from what the President said yesterday and from what you said today, it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re deliberately trying to leave options open to the possibility of a recess appointment by not definitively ruling it out. \xc2\xa0Is that a misinterpretation of what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President tried to be as direct as he could yesterday about what our intent is. \xc2\xa0Our intent is to nominate an indisputably qualified individual to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And our expectation is that the United States Senate will fulfill their constitutional responsibility to give that individual a fair hearing and a timely up or down vote. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what our plan is right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling out a recess appointment?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President, in answering this question, tried to be as direct as he possibly could about what our intentions are.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed that President Obama hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made any recess appointments in four years. \xc2\xa0Can you say why?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what we have tried to do, with, admittedly, mixed success, is to try to find common ground with Republicans to ensure that individuals that the President would like to appoint to work for him here in the administration and make sure that the government functions well -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to work with Republicans in the Senate to make that happen. \xc2\xa0And the President explained -- described some frustration yesterday about the way that Republicans have engaged in that process. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, look, that all being said, I think everybody understands that a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is different than that. \xc2\xa0And every President -- and this is probably true of even President Washington -- had some frustrations with Congress and the pace at which they were acting on their nominations to important jobs in the administration. \xc2\xa0And we certainly have a strong case to make about how Republicans have taken that obstruction to a new level. \xc2\xa0But the fact is, I think everybody understands why a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is different. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make a strong case about the President fulfilling his constitutional responsibilities and why the Senate should fulfill their constitutional responsibilities, and that further dragging this into the politicized context of other administration nominations is certainly not what the framers of our Constitution intended.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0To your knowledge, there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been any secret agreement between the President and Senate leaders about him not making any recess appointments over the last four years?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what we have tried to do is to work in good faith with Republican leaders to see the President\xe2\x80\x99s appointees confirmed by the Senate so they can do the important work of the American people. \xc2\xa0That has been an ongoing process and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that process will continue. \xc2\xa0But I would draw a distinction between that process and the process described by the Constitution for filling a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, would you rule out the possibility that President Obama will appoint himself to the Supreme Court? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That is a novel one. \xc2\xa0I think what I will say is that the President, himself, has said in the past that while he obviously holds in high esteem those who dedicate their lives to serving the country on the Supreme Court, that he envisions something different for himself once he leaves the presidency. \xc2\xa0So I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked him that direct question, but I think all of the available evidence indicates that that option is highly unlikely.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you mean to say by that -- you said that the President is going to pick somebody whose credentials for the job were indisputable. \xc2\xa0Does that mean that the President believes that his credentials for such a position would be in dispute?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think what we have found from Republicans is they have not let facts get in the way of raising disputes about the President and his credentials. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s even one particular Republican who has made himself famous for that. \xc2\xa0So I -- but I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll just leave it there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, I have one more question about something that\xe2\x80\x99s a little more typical for me. \xc2\xa0In South Dakota, the legislature sent to the governor a legislation seeming to discriminate against transgender students by prohibiting them from using the public restroom consistent with their gender identity. \xc2\xa0Critics say that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in conflict with the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position of Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender and the interpretation of that to apply to transgender students. \xc2\xa0Does the President oppose this legislation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President has looked carefully at this particular piece of legislation. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a legal analysis to present to you about how enactment of that legislation would have an impact on things like Title IX. \xc2\xa0What I can just say, more generally, is that the kind of values that this administration has championed have been values that have been dedicated to inclusiveness and non-discrimination, and even respect for other human beings. \xc2\xa0And there are many elements of this legislation that you\xe2\x80\x99ve described that seem to come into sharp conflict with those basic American values.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLynn, nice to see you today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Nice to see you. \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Change of subject.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve covered a lot of subjects today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Tomorrow the Black Hawks are coming for their third visit to the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been on quite a run lately.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could tell me -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where hockey fits in, in Obama\xe2\x80\x99s sports interests. \xc2\xa0I know obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s a big, big basketball fan. \xc2\xa0Do you think he ever will take in a game when he still has time in the White House? \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a little time left. \xc2\xa0And what do you think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to say when a team comes a third time to the White House?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, this particular President is a sports fan. \xc2\xa0And I think we all appreciate the amount of athleticism and skill that\xe2\x80\x99s required to excel in that sport. \xc2\xa0Maybe the next President will be somebody who was born in Canada and will have an even greater appreciation for that sport and the skill that it requires. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut this President is certainly proud of his hometown Chicago Black Hawks and is looking forward to welcoming them here. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are too many other sports teams that have come to the White House three different times for winning championships. \xc2\xa0The UConn women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball team comes to mind as a team that might have broken that record. \xc2\xa0But certainly the President is proud of his hometown team and looking forward to welcoming them here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And where does hockey fit in his sports interests?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President is not a regular viewer of the sport. \xc2\xa0I think even casual fans of hockey can appreciate, again, both the skill and athleticism that\xe2\x80\x99s required to engage in that sport, but also appreciate how exciting playoff hockey is, and that brand of hockey is something that I think causes television ratings to spike in playoff time for hockey. \xc2\xa0But, look, the President is proud of his team and is looking forward to seeing them here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGeorge.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As long as we\xe2\x80\x99re on sports, the President has said that he is not always as sensitive as he should be on optics. \xc2\xa0Can you rule out him going golfing on Saturday instead of the funeral? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a sense of what the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans are for Saturday. \xc2\xa0The President obviously believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the institution of the presidency to pay his respects to somebody who dedicated three decades of his life to the institution of the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And the President gave some pretty thoughtful words in discussing Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s service on the Supreme Court not just Saturday night but also yesterday in his news conference. \xc2\xa0And Friday will be an important opportunity for the President and the First Lady to pay their respects to Justice Scalia. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think that\xe2\x80\x99s important not just on a personal level, but also on an institutional level -- recognizing that it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity not just for this President to pay his personal respects to this individual who served for three decades on the Supreme Court, it also is an appropriate opportunity for the individual who is serving as President of the United States to offer respect to somebody who served in a third branch of government. \xc2\xa0And it will be an important moment. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more details for you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans for both Friday and Saturday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJuliet.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Quick question following up on what you said was the symbolic vote that the President took regarding Justice Alito and what\xe2\x80\x99s happening now. \xc2\xa0Afterwards, you talked about how he regretted what he did, how it contributes to polarization here. \xc2\xa0Is there a distinction -- would you say that there is a distinction between what the President did and what\xe2\x80\x99s happening now because it was clear that his actions would not actually prevent a justice from taking the seat, whereas in this case, that\xe2\x80\x99s an open possibility? \xc2\xa0Or would you consider them roughly equivalent in terms of contributing to the polarization surrounding judicial nominees in the United States?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I actually think that what Republicans are doing now are different than what President Obama -- then-Senator Obama did in 2006 in two important ways. \xc2\xa0And you mentioned one of them. \xc2\xa0The first is, the President was clear at the time in 2006 as he was casting the vote that his vote was not one that was going to have any impact on the outcome. \xc2\xa0Senator -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, then-Judge Alito had sufficient support in the United States Senate to ascend to the Supreme Court, and the President was direct at the time that his vote was symbolic.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut here\xe2\x80\x99s the second thing. \xc2\xa0The President did have substantive reasons to oppose Judge Alito\xe2\x80\x99s nomination. \xc2\xa0And right now, the opposition that Republicans are reflexively expressing is devoted to the idea of the President even nominating somebody to fill that vacancy. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the difference. And that is what is so directly contrary to the requirements of individuals that are outlined in the Constitution of the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one question, keeping in mind that neither you nor I are constitutional lawyers. \xc2\xa0Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s staff would point out that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing specific in the Constitution that dictates hearings or a timely vote on a Supreme Court nominee by the President. \xc2\xa0Could you just flesh out a little more what the interpretation is of this White House of specifically of what the Constitution dictates beyond the idea of simply advise and consent?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not constitutional scholar, but there have been hundreds of people who have served on the Supreme Court, and best as I can remember, that\xe2\x80\x99s the process that they\xe2\x80\x99ve all gone through. \xc2\xa0So, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised that anybody is suggesting that that\xe2\x80\x99s not part of the constitutional responsibilities of the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI will say I feel pretty confident in telling you that even without having these facts at hand, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are some people who ran for the United States Senate, saying that they were going to have an impact on the process of confirming judges. That certainly is something that Senate candidates observe that is part of the responsibility of individual United States senators.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I guess the other part that\xe2\x80\x99s relevant here is we actually have a recent and relevant historical analogy to draw. \xc2\xa0Democrats in 1988 found themselves in the same position; they were in the majority in the Senate and there was a Republican in the White House. \xc2\xa0There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and there was a question that they faced about whether or not they were going to vote in a presidential election year to confirm the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And even though they were not in the same party as the President, they fulfilled their constitutional responsibility, and they did it even though it was an election year. \xc2\xa0And our expectation is that Senate Republicans would do the same. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, again, the fact that Senate Democrats did it right in 1988 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t absolve the entire Democratic Party over the course of history from the role that they have played in contributing to a politicized process. \xc2\xa0President Obama acknowledged yesterday that he played a part in that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the responsibility lies with the institution of the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0And Senator McConnell and other Republican leaders worked tirelessly, campaigning across the country, raising money, giving stump speeches, holding rallies, working weekends to try to get back the majority of the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ll just remind you that on the day after they succeeded in that effort, on the day after the election, Senator McConnell wrote what is now, I believe, probably in his mind, an infamous op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that was headlined \xe2\x80\x9cNow We Can Get Congress Moving Again.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0This is a basic function of Congress. \xc2\xa0And he was acknowledging the role that the majority has in getting Congress moving again. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99s in charge of that institution. \xc2\xa0That institution has a constitutional responsibility. \xc2\xa0And that institution -- the American people certainly have the expectation that that institution will fulfill that duty.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBob.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, the Senate is away this weekend, actually, so we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from relatively few rank-and-file Republicans about how they feel about this issue. \xc2\xa0Does the President believe that --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Funny how their cell phones somehow in these kinds of situations don\xe2\x80\x99t work, or at least don\xe2\x80\x99t get answered quite as quickly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, does the President believe that with time, or whatever, there can be a softening of the stance among at least rank-and-file Republicans regarding this nomination? \xc2\xa0Does he think time may be on his side with this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation is that the institution of the United States Senate can and should fulfill its constitutional responsibility. \xc2\xa0And there are no loopholes in that responsibility. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no election year loophole. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no loophole for a situation in which the President may not share the judicial philosophy of the previous Supreme Court justice. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no loophole in the Constitution for a Supreme Court nominee who might have an impact on the balance of the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0The Constitution is clear about what the expectations are of the institution of the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectations, and it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the expectations of the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m not suggesting obviously how rank-and-file Republicans should act. \xc2\xa0But does the President think that there maybe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a rush to this --- to name someone that quickly while pressure may mount on Republicans to move forward with this?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The amount of time that the President and his team will devote to nominating an individual will be dedicated to making sure that the right person has been chosen for this important job. \xc2\xa0And that is the factor that will be driving the timeline for this decision. \xc2\xa0And as soon as the President and his team have concluded that they have chosen the right person for the job, then we\'ll make that nominee -- we\'ll put forward that nominee. \xc2\xa0And we hope that the Senate will fulfill their responsibility to ensure that that individual receives a fair hearing and a timely yes or no vote.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAngela.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you mentioned how different this might play on the campaign trail among Democratic candidates. \xc2\xa0Has the White House been in touch with either or both of the Clinton and Sanders campaigns as you move forward with working on a nominee?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of any specific conversations that have taken place thus far about who the President is going to choose with either of the candidates present on the Democratic side. \xc2\xa0Look, I think people are going to ask the Democratic candidates what their views are on this process. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ll ask them primarily because it\'s a relevant question to ask. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re running for the job -- they\xe2\x80\x99re running to be given the responsibility, starting in January of 2017, to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0So it makes sense that they would be asked about this process. \xc2\xa0Then-Senator Obama was asked about it a lot in 2007 and 2008. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s a natural question for people to ask.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Given that this could -- we could easily perceive a scenario that this could spill over until next year -- you mentioned the possibility of having a vacancy through two Supreme Court terms -- does the President or his staff plan to discuss this with the Democratic campaigns? \xc2\xa0Is that an important part of his strategy as he works over the next few weeks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\'t anticipate that this would require discussions with campaigns -- again, primarily because this is a responsibility of the sitting President of the United States. \xc2\xa0And there are a whole host of individuals on the Republican and Democratic side who are running to have this responsibility given to them in January of 2017. \xc2\xa0But right now, this responsibility rests with the President. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd there will be a tendency -- it\xe2\x80\x99s natural and even understandable that there will be some politics that will have an influence on the process. \xc2\xa0That started a long time ago, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that will be the case here. \xc2\xa0The question is whether or not the United States Senate -- and in this case, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about Senate Republicans who have the responsibility for running the institution at the United States Senate -- whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to choose their constitutional duty over narrow partisan political considerations. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s an open question right now. \xc2\xa0Their early indications are not particularly good, considering that Republicans have suggested that the President shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even bother nominating somebody. \xc2\xa0But hopefully cooler heads will prevail.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then, lastly, following up on Ayesha\xe2\x80\x99s question on the South China Sea, obviously we saw China -- we saw confirmation, as you were speaking, from the State Department that China has moved missiles to the disputed island. \xc2\xa0It was just yesterday that ASEAN released its statement that was very similar to what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from ASEAN statements in the past, and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t specifically mention China. \xc2\xa0Did the President want a stronger statement, potentially one that actually mentioned China, to come out of ASEAN? \xc2\xa0Or was he satisfied with the words that were chosen to put out yesterday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, we\xe2\x80\x99re more than satisfied. \xc2\xa0I think we\xe2\x80\x99re quite pleased to see the leaders of 10 or so Southeast Asian nations, many of whom do have claims on land features in the South China Sea, put forward a coherent and unified explanation of what they\xe2\x80\x99re committing to. \xc2\xa0And what they\xe2\x80\x99re committing to a set of principles that will promote the peaceful resolution of disputes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat is clearly within the best interest of the United States; it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of our economy; it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of our national security. \xc2\xa0We also believe that it benefits those countries in the same way. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to see that there\xe2\x80\x99s widespread agreement among the United States and our ASEAN partners for resolving these disputes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRich.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Will the President this week sign the North Korea sanctions bill? \xc2\xa0And in discussing North Korea, earlier this month The Washington Post Editorial Board claimed the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategic patience has failed with North Korea due to the recent North Korean provocations. \xc2\xa0Even beyond if the President does sign the sanctions bill, does that warrant a greater response from the U.S.?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Rich, I can tell you that, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say on a number of occasions, the administration is deeply concerned about North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s recent actions and their recent provocations. \xc2\xa0And I can confirm that the President does plan to sign H.R. 757, which includes sanctions measures against North Korea and will serve to increase pressure on North Korea. That\xe2\x80\x99s a goal that Congress stated, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a goal that we share. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know precisely when the President will sign that bill, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know. \xc2\xa0But our plan is to sign it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen it comes more broadly to our approach to North Korea, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about what our strategy is, which is to work effectively with our allies in the region -- more importantly, South Korea and Japan -- but also with our partners in the region, like Russia and China, who have some influence over the North Korean regime. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve presented a united front. \xc2\xa0And President Xi stood in the Rose Garden just last fall and made clear that China would not tolerate a nuclearized Korean Peninsula. \xc2\xa0That was an important declaration. \xc2\xa0And it certainly means that the North Korean regime will continue to be isolated until they begin to take steps closer in the direction of not just the United States and South Korea, but even countries like China, with whom they have a vital relationship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Apple, you said earlier that the White House will back up law enforcement. \xc2\xa0Does that mean that law enforcement, when it comes to these arguments between data security and national security that law enforcement should get what it wants?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think I was pretty clear about that statement applying to this particular situation; that the Department of Justice and FBI investigators have been given a serious responsibility, which is to investigate an act of terrorism in San Bernardino, California, at the end of last year. And they\xe2\x80\x99re conducting that investigation, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that independently. \xc2\xa0But they can count on the support of the White House and the President, who has identified that that investigation is a priority. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to support them as they do their important independent work. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I\xe2\x80\x99d just reiterate what I said before, which is that there is a debate -- an intense debate right now about how to balance the need for encryption and cybersecurity, and protecting privacy and the need to protect the national security of the United States. \xc2\xa0I think the President has described how he approaches that question. \xc2\xa0But, fortunately, the question in this instance is much more narrow. \xc2\xa0And I think, just taking a quick look at the judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, I think the judge thought it was a pretty straightforward answer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t create a marker for further cases? \xc2\xa0I mean, I understand we\'re talking about just this one case, but this one case could set an example very easily for cases in the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This case doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require Apple to change their -- to redesign some element of their software or to create a new backdoor. \xc2\xa0This is a very specific request the Department of Justice has made, and the judge agreed with them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari says that possibly one of -- something that he might push in the future would be breaking up the big banks. \xc2\xa0Was that a missed opportunity in Dodd-Frank, do you think? \xc2\xa0Because it\'s been such an important element in the Democratic debate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we value the independence of the Fed here, so I\'m a little limited in offering up a direct response to what Mr. Kashkari had to say. \xc2\xa0I can just tell you more generally that the President was a leading advocate of Wall Street reform and was happy to sign it into law, and just as importantly, was rigorous about the implementation of the regulations that that law required. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the reason for that is we saw an aggressive effort on the part of Wall Street banks and other large financial institutions to try to chip away at the law\xe2\x80\x99s protections in the regulatory process. \xc2\xa0And that is something that we have resisted. It has contributed in some cases to taking a little longer than expected to implement rules. \xc2\xa0But the fact is we have put in place a financial architecture that does make sure that taxpayers won\'t be on the hook for bailing out banks who make risky bets that go bad. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\'s progress. \xc2\xa0That\'s a good thing for our economy. \xc2\xa0It certainly is a good thing for middle-class families. \xc2\xa0At the same time, we\'ve been mindful of the need to have an architecture that would not stifle innovation. \xc2\xa0We continue -- one of the reasons that the U.S. economy is the envy of the world is we have a dynamic financial system where a variety of institutions can get access to capital. \xc2\xa0That\'s a good thing. \xc2\xa0That\'s an important thing for innovation; it\'s an important thing for the economy; it certainly is an important thing for small business. \xc2\xa0But we also want to make sure that we\'ve got regulators in institutions in Washington, D.C. that are looking out for the interest of middle-class families. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\'s a top priority, and that\'s why the President -- when historians take a look at his legacy, I\'m confident that his success in passing and implementing Wall Street reform will be among the prominent aspects of that legacy that will be widely discussed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Even with big banks intact?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Even with the big banks intact, because of the reforms that we\'ve put in place -- things like higher capital requirements for banks and other steps that we have taken that have -- again, according to the stress tests that also were conducted -- that have put those institutions on more stable financial footing. \xc2\xa0And if we get into a situation where those institutions get weaker we\'ve got steps that we can take to further insulate the American economy and the American people from the fallout.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'ve learned a lot of important lessons since the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. \xc2\xa0Many of them relate to the kinds of basic investments that are critical to the success of our economy and to middle-class families, but some of them relate to the way in which our financial system should be regulated to make it more stable and to not leave taxpayers on the hook for financial institutions whose risky bets go bad.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\'ll give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0In about three hours, the Pope is going to be celebrating Mass on the border between the U.S. and Mexico, in Juarez. \xc2\xa0And Donald Trump has come out and said basically that the Pope is in the pocket of Mexico, he wants to keep the border the way it is -- Mexico does -- because they\xe2\x80\x99re making a fortune, and we are losing. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering if the White House has any comment.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any direct response to Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments. \xc2\xa0I will just say more generally that I was one of those who was fortunate enough to be on the South Lawn of the White House when Pope Francis visited last fall, and it was clear even from the brief remarks that he delivered here, that he\xe2\x80\x99s a man of deep faith and he\xe2\x80\x99s quite passionate about what he\xe2\x80\x99s called to do and what that faith calls him to do. \xc2\xa0And certainly his commitment to social justice and looking out for those who are less fortunate are things that -- are priorities that he has set for himself, not just because he wants to cultivate his own image or to score political points, but rather because he feels called to serve those people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think it was pretty evident that his passion and his personal motivation through his faith we\'re authentic. \xc2\xa0And I certainly wouldn\'t call it into question at all.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks a lot, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\'ll see you tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:15 P.M.
