EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\'s Josh Earnest.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for jumping on the call.\xc2\xa0 As Rob mentioned, we\'ll hear some brief remarks from Secretary Gates and then we\'ll open it up for questions.\xc2\xa0 We\'re running tight on time, so we\'ll move quickly and we won\'t have any follow-up questions.\xc2\xa0 So you just get one bite at the apple here.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates, do you want to start us off?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just start with a couple of comments.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the atmosphere here at Camp Lejeune for the speech was very warm, very enthusiastic.\xc2\xa0 And I would also say that the welcome has been pretty extraordinary.\xc2\xa0 I think that the speech was very well received.\xc2\xa0 There were a number of interruptions for applause, as you may have all seen.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the substance, I obviously am very supportive of the option that the President has chosen, the decision that he has made, as is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\xc2\xa0 Frankly, this is where both the Chairman and I thought this should come out and it was a very thorough, deliberative process, where a lot of different options and a lot of different analysis were examined.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that, why don\'t I just go straight to questions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Secretary.\xc2\xa0 Rob, why don\'t we go ahead and open it up to some questions now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates, one of the things that surprised me in the speech was his flat-out saying, all troops would be out by 2011, at the end of 2011.\xc2\xa0 And I know he referenced the Status of Forces Agreement, but he seemed quite definitive about that.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what he meant and -- is that what he meant, everybody is out by 2011, no matter what?<br/>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 I think what he was referring to was that under the terms of the Status of Forces Agreement, which is what we are operating under now, all U.S. forces must be out by the end of 2011.\xc2\xa0 It will require a new agreement -- or it would require a new agreement, a new negotiation -- almost certainly an Iraqi initiative -- to provide for some presence beyond the end of 2011.\xc2\xa0 So in the absence of that agreement, in the absence of any negotiation for such an agreement, it is in keeping with the SOFA that, to say definitively, that we will be out at the end of 2011.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hello, sir.\xc2\xa0 What difference did the three months make for you, going from 16 months to 19 months?\xc2\xa0 And what problems did you have with the 19 -- with the 16-month issue in the first place?<br/>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the view of the commanders in the field, particularly General Odierno, was that the real concern -- I\'m going to interrupt myself -- the real concern has been how do we get through this year and all of the elections that will take place -- beginning with the district and sub-district elections early in the summer, the national elections at the end of the year -- and have a period of adjustment after those national elections, to make sure people are accepting the results and so on, and that we would have the maximum force presence during -- through the end of this year, and early into next year?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if you go along that timeline, even if there are some reductions during the course of this year, as there will be, it provides the maximum available force for General Odierno, during that sensitive period.\xc2\xa0 And to try and get everybody out by May, would have -- if you do that, then really would present some significant logistical and security issues.\xc2\xa0 And so the extra two months or so was considered to be important, in terms of just the logistics of how you do that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Mr. Secretary.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to follow up on the first question about the possibility of forces remaining after the end of 2011.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve said in the past that you foresee that that could happen and in fact would be useful to assist the Iraqi forces.\xc2\xa0 Does that remain your view, if the Iraqis are interested in doing it, that it would also be in the interest of the United States to do it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\'ll have to wait and see.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\'s a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 The Iraqis have not said anything about that at this point.\xc2\xa0 So it remains to be seen whether they will take an initiative.\xc2\xa0 I think that we should be -- my own view would be that we should be prepared to have some very modest-sized presence for training and helping them with their new equipment and providing, perhaps, intelligence support and so on beyond that.\xc2\xa0 But again, it\'s hypothetical, because such a -- no such request has been made, and no indication that it will be at this point.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi there, sir.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to get a little clarification on the difference between the combat and non-combat troops.\xc2\xa0 Once the U.S. has pulled all combat troops out by August 31st of next year, the remaining troops will be non-combat.\xc2\xa0 But they will, presumably, be combat-capable.\xc2\xa0 Will there be a real significant difference in what troops are doing today and what the troops will be doing once they\'re officially designated non-combat?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 All of the combat units will be out of Iraq by the end of August in 2010.\xc2\xa0 And those that are left will have a combat capability.\xc2\xa0 There will be, as the President said, targeted counterterrorism operations.\xc2\xa0 There will be continued embeds with some of the Iraqi forces in a training capacity and so on.\xc2\xa0 So there will be the capability, but the units will be gone.\xc2\xa0 And more importantly, the mission will have changed.\xc2\xa0 And so the notion of being engaged in combat in the way we have been up until now will be completely different.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates, how flexible is this plan?\xc2\xa0 And can you describe -- the President has suggested often that he is partial to decision-making based on conditions on the ground.\xc2\xa0 In light of that, how fluid and nimble is this timetable projection?\xc2\xa0 And if it is so nimble and fluid, why set a date at all?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that -- first of all, because he said that he would, and I think that it is important to have a date in terms of the conclusion of one mission and the beginning of another mission.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the date provides a way of delineating when one mission in Iraq and a completely new and different one begins.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that the date is important.\xc2\xa0 It\'s important for our troops to know.\xc2\xa0 It\'s important for the Iraqis to know.\xc2\xa0 And I think in terms of flexibility, I mean, the President has made clear that he\'s the Commander-in-Chief and retains the flexibility to make changes.\xc2\xa0 He clearly does not anticipate having to do that; he has balanced the risks of staying longer or coming out sooner, and has come out in this direction and I think it is the expectation of all of us involved in that process and, above all, him, that we will meet these timelines.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Secretary Gates, I\'d like to ask you about the shift -- President Obama says twice in the speech about refocusing on al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got 17,000 troops going over; people are calling it a surge, but it seems like a buildup.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little more about how you see that force, in terms of how long they\'re going to be -- I guess it will be 55,000 troops by summer in Afghanistan -- if you see that force getting larger in the coming years.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A surge tends to imply that these folks would -- you know, those numbers would come down in a couple of years, as they did in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Do you see that force remaining a large force for years to come?\xc2\xa0 Do you see that force getting larger than 55,000?\xc2\xa0 How do you foresee that scenario in Afghanistan with the troops?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 First, no one involved in the process has, to my knowledge, ever referred to the additional troops going into Iraq -- I mean, into Afghanistan as a surge.\xc2\xa0 I think that the question about how long the additional forces will be there is a question that will be addressed, and whether additional forces would be sent is to be determined by the review that is going on right now and the decisions the President will make once that review is over.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think that there won\'t be a real sense of the ultimate size of the force or the duration of its presence until he has made those decisions subsequent to the conclusion of the review.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, and forgive me if I\'m asking a question that you already answered -- I got disconnected.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to go back to the issue of the 35,000 to 50,000 troops that are going to remain in Iraq after 18 months.\xc2\xa0 You have said they\'re not going to be combat brigades, but are you going to take combat brigades that are in the United States and sort of rename them, redesignate them, or are you going to create new units for this specific mission?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could as a separate question on Afghanistan, the Marines that are -- that Barack, the President, spoke to today, what will their mission be when they get to Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0 Will it be population security, to mentor Afghan forces, (inaudible) the Taliban?\xc2\xa0 If you could talk a little bit about specifically how they\'ll be used.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 Well, with respect to the second question, I think it\'s probably all of the above.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is they will be deployed principally into the south, and so they will be combating the Taliban, it will be population security.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with respect to the 35,000 to 50,000, I think that that\'s a question probably better directed at General Odierno.\xc2\xa0 But the clear idea is to consolidate U.S. forces into a few places where both civilians and military would be.\xc2\xa0 In other words our folks would provide protection for the provincial reconstruction teams and other civilians working in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of whether those are new units or whether they are re-missioned units that are already there, I think remains to be seen.\xc2\xa0 But if they are our forces that are already in Iraq that remain at that point, then -- then they will be re-missioned to the new much more limited mission that we\'ve been talking about.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Secretary Gates.\xc2\xa0 If the situation in Iraq were to take a turn for the worse, has the President mentioned discussing how many troops he\'d be willing to send back to the country, in addition to the troops that are there, as non-combat forces?\xc2\xa0 And would that affect the troop levels being built up in Afghanistan?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 I think -- you know, that\'s pretty hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 I think, you know, we are -- we feel that we have -- the decisions the President has made has taken into account the risks that have been identified both by Ambassador Crocker and by General Odierno surrounding the election.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons that General Odierno wanted to maintain as many troops as he could just beyond the end of 2009 was, in fact, to be available for those kinds of -- those kinds of contingencies.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that -- you know, the truth of the matter is, the Iraqis are going to have to step up to their responsibilities in this, and I think you saw with the performance of the Iraqi security forces in the provincial elections that they really did a superb job of maintaining security.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think the general view is that we will proceed on this -- on this timeline and the approach the President has identified.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think anybody is talking about sending more troops back in there if there are problems.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates, I was wondering if there was -- you had talked a little bit about the drawdown being sort of back-loaded to 2010, to make sure there\'s enough troops for the elections.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could say, first, how many units we should expect to come out this year, just sort of roughly.\xc2\xa0 And also, if you could talk a little bit about the movement of air assets, and if we should see -- expect a lot of surveillance and attack aircraft moving from Iraq to Afghanistan, and when we might see that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 I think that the two theaters are clearly separate, and frankly I don\'t know the answer to your question about air assets and so on moving from one place to the other.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are adding intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 At this point -- or up to this point, most of what we have been adding in Afghanistan are new assets; they have not been assets transferred from Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But as we draw down in Iraq, some of those enabling assets may move from one theater to another.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll just have to wait and see.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the number of troops coming out this year, I think we\'ll just have to wait and see what General Odierno\'s specific recommendations are.\xc2\xa0 But again, the general approach is to try and -- there will be drawdowns this year of combat brigades, but in terms of how many and when, I think we\'ll wait and get the specific recommendations from General Odierno.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Mr. Secretary.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what happened to the 23-months option?\xc2\xa0 And you said this came out where both you and the Chairman thought it should, but at one time there were some pretty strong voices arguing for a longer timeline.\xc2\xa0 How did you settle on the 19 months versus a slightly longer version?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) to General Odierno about his views, to General Petraeus about his views, to the Chiefs, and then obviously the Chairman and I talked to him separately, or independently.\xc2\xa0 But -- and I think in this whole process, there was really, with each of the options that was being examined -- 16 months, 19 months, and 23 months -- and all of those dated from the inauguration, basically -- was a weighing of the risks involved, the risks of the progress with respect to the sustaining progress in Iraq, but also issues relating to stress on the force and the need for additional capability in Afghanistan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All these things were taken into account, and I think that the -- I think that General Odierno and General Petraeus are comfortable with the option that the President has decided on.\xc2\xa0 And both the Chiefs as well as the Chairman and myself are very supportive of that option, as well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, in his speech, President Obama talked about a training mission for Iraqi security forces that was conditioned on them being nonsectarian.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a bit about what mechanisms you\'ll have in place going forward to adjudicate whether or not certain units act in a sectarian fashion that might require the withdrawal of American support?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GATES:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I think that we have been very pleased by the progress in Iraq and the development of the Iraqi army as a nonsectarian force, and it has operated as a nonsectarian force as illustrated by the offensive several months ago in Basra.\xc2\xa0 And so I think we have a pretty good feel that this -- that the army is developing along nonsectarian lines, is operating on nonsectarian lines.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s -- that really is the premise from which we start.\xc2\xa0 We have close enough relationships with these units -- both as advisors and occasionally as embeds, that I think if we saw concerns like that we would be aware of them and be able to bring them -- that some unit was acting in sectarian fashion, that we would be in a position to bring that to the attention of the Iraqi leadership.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, all.</div> <div
