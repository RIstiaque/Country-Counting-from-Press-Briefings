Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>12:57 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House on this glorious Monday.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>Darlene, would you like to get us started?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I have a couple questions on the report today on the Affordable Care Act -- 16 million Americans signed up since the law --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good place to start.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I thought you were going to start with that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I considered it, but given the late beginning here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given all the positive numbers in that report, why do you think it is that the debate over the Affordable Care Act is not settled?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think principally it\xe2\x80\x99s because we\'ve seen tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars being spent by the President\xe2\x80\x99s political opponents to distort the facts about the true impact of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 So this is money, plain and simple.\xc2\xa0 And what we have said is that the more that the American people understand the benefits that are associated with this law the more people will approve of it, or at least the more that the approval of this will show up in polls.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut frankly, we\'re not concerned about the numbers in the polls.\xc2\xa0 We\'re concerned about the numbers that demonstrate the impact of this law.\xc2\xa0 And whether it\'s 16 million people being -- uninsured people getting access to health care coverage since the law went into effect, that\'s a pretty good number.\xc2\xa0 The decline in the overall insurance uninsured rate dropping 35 percent, that\'s a pretty good number.\xc2\xa0 The historically low growth in health care costs since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, that\'s a good number, too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\'s what we\'re monitoring, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has placed such a premium among members of his team on the implementation of this law.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re only building momentum and we\'re certainly pleased about the progress that we\'ve seen so far.\xc2\xa0 But there continues to be a lot of work that needs to get done.\xc2\xa0 And I think probably the best example of that that I can highlight for you is the continued resistance that we\'ve seen in some quarters to the expansion of Medicaid.</p>\n<p>There continue to be Republicans across the country who are blocking the expansion of Medicaid in a way that literally prevents individuals in their states from getting badly needed health care coverage that would be 100 percent paid for by the federal government.\xc2\xa0 And for the life of me, I can\'t understand why anybody would reach that conclusion.\xc2\xa0 But some Republicans in this case are quite literally putting their political ambition against the lives of some people in their state.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a shame and that\'s unfortunate, but it\'s consistent with the kind of political opposition that we\'ve seen from Republicans to what in many cases is a pretty common-sense implementation of the law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The report shows that those states that went ahead and expanded Medicaid are doing better in terms of covering uninsured people than those states that haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Given what you just said about the Medicaid expansion, do you think the report will somehow encourage some of these other states to go ahead and get on board?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I certainly hope so.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s certainly what the data would show, that there is a positive impact on the health of citizens in these states when Medicaid is expanded.\xc2\xa0 There certainly is a positive impact on health care providers in these states, because *Medicare [Medicaid] ensures that their uncompensated care costs are reduced.\xc2\xa0 These are -- individuals who don\'t have access to health care, aren\'t able to pay their medical bills, automatically those bills are assumed either by the government or by those of us who are paying insurance premiums.\xc2\xa0 But because of Medicaid expansion, you have a role for the federal government to step in and take care of some of those costs and make sure that these individuals are getting health care before their conditions get too bad.</p>\n<p>The other thing that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that the costs to states themselves are alleviated by this as well.\xc2\xa0 So whether it\xe2\x80\x99s health benefits, benefits for the economy, or benefits for the bottom lines of these state governments, the impact of Medicaid expansion is very positive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the White House respond yet to Senator McConnell saying yesterday that Loretta Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s nomination may be delayed further.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a disappointment that after 128 days since being nominated to be the next attorney general that Loretta Lynch, a professional, independent, career prosecutor, has not yet gotten a vote in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an unconscionable delay.\xc2\xa0 Ms. Lynch has submitted to more than eight hours of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\xc2\xa0 She answered more than 600 written questions from senators, to say nothing of the countless other conversations that she has had in more private settings with individual members of the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>She is somebody who has distinguished herself over the course of her career as a tough, fair, independent lawyer.\xc2\xa0 She has developed strong relations with law enforcement because of that reputation.\xc2\xa0 She is somebody who has successfully prosecuted terrorists who targeted the Federal Reserve Headquarters in New York as well as the New York City subway system.\xc2\xa0 She is somebody who has gone after public corruption and has brought charges against public officials in both parties.\xc2\xa0 She is somebody who has secured billions in settlements from some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest banks who are accused of fraud.\xc2\xa0 And she has jailed some of New York\xe2\x80\x99s most violent and notorious mobsters and gang members.</p>\n<p>So this is somebody with a demonstrated track record of law enforcement who is up for the top law enforcement job in the country.\xc2\xa0 There is not a single legitimate question that has been raised about her aptitude for this job.\xc2\xa0 Instead, all we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is a bunch of political obstruction from Republicans that, again, does not speak well of Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to run the Senate in an effective fashion and certainly not in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell laid out a timeline yesterday that suggests that it could be mid-April at the earliest before her nomination goes to the floor.\xc2\xa0 Is that a timeline the White House would be willing to accept?\xc2\xa0 And if not, what is the alternative or how do you get her nomination voted on earlier?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, this is the responsibility of the United States Senate to vote on the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominees.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned before, there has not been a legitimate question that\xe2\x80\x99s been raised about her aptitude for the office.\xc2\xa0 So the delay is unconscionable; it\xe2\x80\x99s unexplained.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the thing that I think warrants mentioning here is you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that, as I pointed out, Ms. Lynch has been waiting 128 days to get a vote in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 The reason that that time period has been so long is because the President nominated her back in November for this job.\xc2\xa0 And at that time, we saw Senator McConnell himself say that Ms. Lynch, A, will receive fair consideration -- I think he\xe2\x80\x99d be hard-pressed to say -- to make the case that he lived up to that promise -- but, B, he also said that her nomination should be considered in the course of -- or, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- should be considered in the new Congress through regular order.</p>\n<p>So, essentially, you had Senator McConnell in the position back in November telling the President that he should delay submitting her up to Congress until Republicans were in the majority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten asked a number of times since November about whether or not the President trusts Senator McConnell, whether or not Senator McConnell and other members of the Republican leadership -- whether their word is good with the President.\xc2\xa0 So Senator McConnell, back in November, was saying that her nomination should be considered in the new Congress.\xc2\xa0 But yesterday, when Senator McConnell was asked on CNN about whether or not he was going to act quickly to confirm her, and to explain the delay, he said the nomination hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken that long if you consider when it was actually taken up, which was this year.\xc2\xa0 He continued to say the Democrat majority back in December had a chance to work on the nomination earlier, but decided to delay until this year.\xc2\xa0 He failed to point out that that delay was at his request.</p>\n<p>And now he\xe2\x80\x99s in the position of delaying her nomination even further despite the fact -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it again -- no legitimate question has been raised about her aptitude for this office, despite the fact that she has submitted to more than eight hours of testimony, and despite the fact that she has answered more than 600 written questions.</p>\n<p>So there is no question that Republicans are playing politics with the nomination of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top law enforcement official, and it should come to an end.</p>\n<p>Julia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 The State Department is saying after Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s comments over the weekend that Assad should be included in talks to work out negotiations in Syria that they\xe2\x80\x99re still keeping with their same policy, saying that he has to leave.\xc2\xa0 So what motivation does Assad have to come to the table if he also would have to leave?\xc2\xa0 And what pressure is being used to bring him into such talks?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As the State Department has said -- and I had the opportunity to see some portion of Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s interview; he was referring to the fact that the Assad regime will have to be at the negotiating table with elements of the moderate opposition to try to broker an arrangement about the political transition in Syria.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs far as Assad\xe2\x80\x99s motivation goes, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to understand his motivation.\xc2\xa0 What would cause somebody to drop barrel bombs on innocent civilians?\xc2\xa0 What would cause somebody to so disrupt the very fabric of their country that he would allow ISIL to run roughshod over significant portions of the country that he\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be governing, and slaughtering some of the citizens that he\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be serving?<br/>\n\tSo I have a difficult time trying to speak to his motivation.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is the United States is going to continue to work actively with the international community to try to bring about some resolution to the political situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 But what is, I think understandably, at the top of our priority list is dealing with the threat that is posed by extremists who are capitalizing on the chaos inside Syria right now.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that Assad is responsible for that chaos.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a reflection of his failed leadership that we see extremists who are attempting to establish Syria as a safe haven to carry out acts of terror around the globe, certainly around that region.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen such a vibrant international response.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, all of this rests at Assad\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we are optimistic that as we move forward we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to succeed in working with the international community to limit this threat, to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL as an organization, to take out other extremists that may be operating inside Syria, and hopefully, that once we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to make some progress as it relates to the security situation, we can also make progress on the political situation inside Syria, too.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on the cyclone that hit many South Pacific islands, we haven\'t heard from the President on that.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his response, and is he going to offer any kind of aid?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start by saying that we offer our condolences to the people of Vanuatu, Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands, and Kiribati as they cope with the devastating impact of Cyclone Pam.\xc2\xa0 Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their loved ones.<br/>\n\tIn the wake of this cyclone, the United States government immediately issued disaster declarations from our U.S. embassies in the region.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re working closely with our NGO partners and other nations in the region on the most effective ways to deliver our relief response.\xc2\xa0 The USAID has sent an assessment team to Vanuatu to coordinate our response.\xc2\xa0 So for details on that ongoing effort I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to USAID and to the Department of Defense that often can provide logistical support in these kinds of situations.<br/>\n\tJustin.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to circle back on the Lynch nomination first.\xc2\xa0 Mitch McConnell said that the reason that he\xe2\x80\x99s holding it up is this human trafficking bill.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I saw that, too.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric was asked about it last week and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t really weigh in from you guys.\xc2\xa0 And so what I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering is whether you guys have a position on whether the bill should be passed as is.\xc2\xa0 And specifically, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of controversy over an anti-abortion provision in the bill, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s something that you guys would veto were it to pass the Senate.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Justin, right now it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the votes to pass the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Over the course of last month, we spent a lot of time talking about the efforts of congressional Republicans to pass funding for the Department of Homeland Security, and I observed at the time it was difficult to think of a more common-sense measure that should be able to earn bipartisan support in the United States Congress than funding for the Department of Homeland Security.<br/>\n\tWell, sure enough, a month later, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve found a more common-sense measure that Democrats and Republicans should be able to get together to support, and that is an effort to concentrate federal resources to stop child sex trafficking.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to hand it to Republicans that they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken even a measure as common sense as that and turned it into a partisan controversy.<br/>\n\tThat is not a reflection of a flaw in the bill, it\xe2\x80\x99s a reflection of inept leadership; that surely, Democrats and Republicans should be, in regular order, able to work together to advance legislation that would allow us to concentrate our efforts to focus on and crack down on individuals who seek to traffic in children.\xc2\xa0 But yet, Mitch McConnell and Republicans in Congress have succeeded in turning this into a partisan controversy.<br/>\n\tAnd again, I also noted last month that Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell got together the day after the election and they wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal.\xc2\xa0 The headline of the op-ed was \xe2\x80\x9cNow We Can Get Congress Going.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Well, hopefully, Leader McConnell can get Congress going on passing a piece of legislation that would stop child sex trafficking.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, how are they turning it into a partisan issue?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Hold on.\xc2\xa0 Justin, you have anything else?<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMara, go ahead.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How are they turning it into a partisan controversy?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, right now you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a whole bunch of Democrats on the other side of the aisle saying they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to support it because of a provision that Republicans have inserted in this widely supported bill.\xc2\xa0 So again, if Republicans are going to be in a situation where they want to -- to use their words -- \xe2\x80\x9cget Congress going,\xe2\x80\x9d surely, they should be able to find a way to build bipartisan support for a bill that is going to counteract child sex trafficking.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t that just Democrats and Republicans having their usual partisan difference over abortion?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because you have a situation in which you have the Republican majorities setting the tone for what bills are going to come to the floor and what bills are going to be voted on and what bills are going to be passed.\xc2\xa0 So the fact that Leader McConnell can\xe2\x80\x99t build bipartisan support for a child sex trafficking bill I think is an indication that his leadership here in the majority is not off to a very strong start.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just had two quick ones.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a hearing this week in the Senate on the crude oil export ban.\xc2\xa0 This is something that you guys have said that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at before, and also, the idea here is that it would fund the Highway Trust Fund, which is obviously a priority for the President.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, has that evaluation process moved on at all?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any feelings on whether or not you\xe2\x80\x99d support this legislation?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update in terms of our position on this.\xc2\xa0 These rules and regulations are administered by the Department of Commerce, so if there\xe2\x80\x99s any change, it will be announced over there.<br/>\n\tAnd as it relates to investing in infrastructure, we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward what we believe is the best way to do that.\xc2\xa0 That is closing loopholes that only benefit wealthy and well-connected corporations, and using that money to invest in the kind of infrastructure that everybody benefits from.\xc2\xa0 So we believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to invest in our infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 But if there are other ways that members of Congress have for trying to fund those efforts, then we\xe2\x80\x99re open to considering them.\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to this specific change, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Commerce Department.\xc2\xa0 There is no change in our policy at this point.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then one last one on Israel.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Netanyahu said earlier today that if he were to be reelected, that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t envision the creation of a Palestinian state during his time in office.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you guys had a reaction to those comments.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Justin, you\'ve observed that I have worked assiduously to avoid commenting on the claims made on the campaign trail by American politicians.\xc2\xa0 That rule, at least in this case, applies to Israeli politicians, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, this one, I mean, obviously has a pretty severe foreign policy implication for your guys\xe2\x80\x99 hopes.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a central kind of public -- Secretary Kerry and his time in the State Department.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is true that our policy is that we believe that the situation should be resolved with a democratic and Jewish state of Israel living side by side in peace and security with a sovereign and contiguous Palestinian state.\xc2\xa0 That is our policy.\xc2\xa0 That is something that we are going to continue to work with the international community to achieve diplomatically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We believe that a resolution along the lines of what I just described is clearly in the best interests of the Israeli people, our closest allies in the Middle East, but it also happens to be in the best interests of the Palestinian people, as well.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we have worked with other countries around the world to try to reach this outcome, and that continues to be our policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the election of an Israeli prime minister who did not share that goal be a setback or a problem for that process?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the Israeli people will be responsible for choosing their next prime minister, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll have that opportunity as early as tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You promised to April.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, April.\xc2\xa0 I get confused with the whole Mara-Justin thing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mess it all up.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So, Josh, I want to go back to the issue of Loretta Lynch.\xc2\xa0 And you just said it was unexplained and unconscionable for this delay.\xc2\xa0 But Democrats on the Hill are saying that her confirmation hearing is being held up, she\xe2\x80\x99s being a political pawn and she\xe2\x80\x99s being held up for this trafficking issue.\xc2\xa0 What do you say about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Ms. Lynch was nominated 128 days ago.\xc2\xa0 That is ample opportunity for the Senate to perform their responsibility to evaluate her candidacy for this job.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is no one in that 128 days has raised a legitimate concern about her aptitude for the job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact is she is an independent career prosecutor who has a long track record of success that spans three decades or nearly three decades.\xc2\xa0 She is somebody who has been previously confirmed by the United States Senate to serve at the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York.\xc2\xa0 In that role, she successfully prosecuted terrorists.\xc2\xa0 She successfully prosecuted gangsters and mobsters. She successfully prosecuted white-collar criminals in New York.\xc2\xa0 She is somebody with a strong track record, and it\xe2\x80\x99s what has earned her the strong support of law enforcement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there is no good reason that she has not been confirmed. I guess the one thing that differentiates this situation from the DHS funding situation is that if Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t act on funding for the Department of Homeland Security, then it would raise concerns about the Department of Homeland Security to plan for the future, to be able to pay their employees.\xc2\xa0 In this situation we have the current Attorney General who is serving in office, and while this delay is unconscionable and I think very difficult for anybody on the Republican side to explain, we do take some solace in the fact in knowing that we have a very aggressive, a very capable Attorney General in Eric Holder who remains in that office, and is getting up early and is working late, and using every authority that he has in that office to do the right thing for the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with other Democrats, again, on the Hill who are saying that she\xe2\x80\x99s a political pawn?\xc2\xa0 Her vote, her confirmation vote is being held up because McConnell is upset because trafficking did not happen when it was supposed to happen.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with the Democrats?\xc2\xa0 Does this White House agree?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve described the scenario that I think is going on up there, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unconscionable that a career prosecutor with a track record like this would be treated this way by Republicans in the Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the plan B?\xc2\xa0 The vote is so close, it\xe2\x80\x99s very tight.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s plan B?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is no plan B.\xc2\xa0 This is a career prosecutor who deserves strong bipartisan support, and she should get it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, and one more question.\xc2\xa0 On ACA and the numbers of -- the decline in the numbers of African Americans and Latinos who are uninsured.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the other aspect of the report that Darlene referred to at the top, that the decline in the uninsured rate that we saw after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act is something that has been true across all race and ethnic groups as well.\xc2\xa0 So the overall decline in the uninsured rate has been from a little over 20 percent to just above 13 percent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an even larger decline in the African American community, that the decline has been 9.2 percentage points.\xc2\xa0 That has allowed 2.3 million Americans to gain coverage.\xc2\xa0 In the Hispanic community, the improvement has been even more substantial.\xc2\xa0 The uninsured rate has dropped 12.3 percentage points, and 4.2 million Americans have gain coverage.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve very pleased about the impact that this has had in expanding coverage for more Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s good for the health care of these individuals, obviously.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also good for the bottom line of state and local governments.\xc2\xa0 And it happens to be good for our economy as well.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow first on Loretta Lynch.\xc2\xa0 You do have a plan B in that Attorney General Holder has said he would stay on.\xc2\xa0 Is there any limit to how long he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to stay?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Attorney General Holder is a dedicated public servant and he is somebody who has been extraordinarily effective in the office of the Attorney General and using the authority of that office to keep the American people safe and to protect their civil rights.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep doing that as long as --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As long as it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.\xc2\xa0 And look, he is somebody who has a reputation for his work ethic.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s getting up early in the morning, he\xe2\x80\x99s staying late at night, and he\xe2\x80\x99s doing everything that he can do while he\xe2\x80\x99s in that office to protect the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 He works hard.\xc2\xa0 Do you find it a little ironic that the effect of the Republican delay on Loretta Lynch is to keep Attorney General Eric Holder, somebody Republicans in the House held in contempt, to extend his term as Attorney General?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting observation.\xc2\xa0 I will tell you that despite his work ethic, I think Attorney General Holder is looking forward to the day when he can hand the keys to that office to Ms. Lynch.\xc2\xa0 She is an extraordinarily qualified nominee.\xc2\xa0 And while he is dedicated to his job and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to work hard at it, he\xe2\x80\x99s also looking forward to the day when she\xe2\x80\x99s going to take that office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, on Iran, you\xe2\x80\x99ve suggested to us repeatedly that the end of the month deadline was a real deadline, with the possibility of extending it is pretty remote, that it\xe2\x80\x99s either going to happen or it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen.\xc2\xa0 Would you really walk away from these talks if there is no deal by the end of the month?\xc2\xa0 Or do you now see the possibility that it could be a slight extension?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, I think the President has spoken to this, so I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to look for the words that he used.\xc2\xa0 But I can characterize them as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been negotiating for more than a year, and the President and our international partners who are participating in this negotiation have been very clear about what our expectations are -- that we want to have resolution to the idea that Iran will come into compliance with the international expectations about their nuclear program and take the extraordinary step of submitting to historically intrusive inspections to verify their compliance with the agreement.</p>\n<p>That is the best way for us to resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what will be part of a deal -- essentially, shutting down every path that Iran has to a nuclear weapon and allowing intrusive inspections to verify their compliance with the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And if that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that Iran is able to agree to after more than a year of negotiations, then, yes, the President and our international partners will walk away will seek to ratchet up the pressure on the Iranians.</p>\n<p>But the fact of the matter is those negotiations are still underway and we should allow the negotiators the two weeks that remain to try to hammer out that political agreement.\xc2\xa0 Now, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve also said is that there are a lot of i\xe2\x80\x99s to be dotted and t\xe2\x80\x99s to be crossed in terms of the technical annexes, and we would expect for that to take a couple of more months, probably until the end of June.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99d have a second deadline for the details.\xc2\xa0 But you still think in terms of the general framework agreement that the end of March is the real deadline and we\xe2\x80\x99re highly unlikely that we see an extension?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, Jon, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing this for more than a year and the President -- despite our commitment to protecting the confidentiality of the negotiations, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been publicly clear about what our expectations are.\xc2\xa0 And these are expectations that are not just held by the President; these are expectations that are held by our international partners as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is this done, by the way, when you have a deal?\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a big ceremony?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to see a handshake?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what happens when this deal is done?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the choreography of it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a good sense of that.\xc2\xa0 But I do know that the administration, as the Chief of Staff indicated in his letter to Senator Corker over the weekend, is committed to sharing information with Congress, as we have throughout this process, about what that deal looks like.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just one question on emails -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go beyond Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails here.\xc2\xa0 You saw late last week we learned that the State Department actually hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been routinely saving State Department emails.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not even talking about Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails -- State.gov emails.\xc2\xa0 The Inspector General said that they have a special program for choosing which to be saved, that only about 60,000 out of 3 billion in 2011 were saved.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned?\xc2\xa0 And I know you\xe2\x80\x99re going to tell me this is up to the State Department, this is up to the agencies.\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, if you have a situation where you have one of your departments routinely not preserving their emails, as clearly required by law, I would think -- wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t there be an interest in the White House of kind of taking a look, having an independent look at this and say, fix this mess?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 Let me slightly quibble with the premise of your question, that I think that the precise way to describe this is -- and the State Department has acknowledged this -- that they did not have a system in place to automatically save the emails.\xc2\xa0 There is some evidence to indicate that at least some State Department employees were routinely saving their emails.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but a pretty small percentage, though.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The point is that we do know that thousands of them have been provided to Congress in response to inquiries from Congress.\xc2\xa0 But, look, what the State Department has also indicated is that they are seeking to update and improve this process and they\xe2\x80\x99re working with the National Archives and Records Administration to institute a process that would make it automatic that those emails are saved and that is what they should do.</p>\n<p>Olivier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple for you.\xc2\xa0 First, the upcoming Afghanistan summit -- I asked you before whether Pakistan would have a seat at the table and I want to circle back on that.\xc2\xa0 And then I want to ask you whether the President is going to use this summit to announce any changes to the timetable of the American withdrawal.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Olivier, I still won\xe2\x80\x99t have much information to share about possible Pakistani involvement in these talks.\xc2\xa0 If we get greater clarity about that we\xe2\x80\x99ll share that information with you.</p>\n<p>As it relates to the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy for reducing our military footprint in Afghanistan, I can tell you that the President, as has been publicly reported, has been closely consulting with his national security team and with his commanders on the ground, as he has over the course of the last several years that this strategy has been executed, about the proper pace of that military drawdown.\xc2\xa0 We do have military personnel that continues to serve in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 They are there both to carry out some counterterrorism missions that don\xe2\x80\x99t just protect the American people but also protect the military personnel in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 They also are engaged in an effort to train and advise and support Afghan security forces as they have taken security responsibility for their country.</p>\n<p>The President and our military take very seriously this partnership that the United States has with Afghanistan, and the President will listen carefully to the advice that he is getting from his national security team and his military commanders on this matter -- that is the pace of the drawdown.</p>\n<p>What I can tell you continues, however, to be a firm part of the strategy is that by the beginning of 2017, the President envisions a scenario where our military presence in Afghanistan has been further and substantially reduced to a Kabul-centric presence that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on protecting the embassy and is focused on some of the military coordination and cooperation that I described before.\xc2\xa0 And that would represent a substantial drawdown in the number of troops then from what our presence looked like even just a couple of years ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, there\xe2\x80\x99s a news report out there that the White House is getting advice on how to take on the Islamic State from former General David Petraeus.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can confirm that.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Olivier, obviously, General Petraeus is somebody who served for a number of years in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 He commanded a large number of American military personnel in that country.\xc2\xa0 Over that time, he developed strong relationships with some of his Iraqi counterparts and with some of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders.\xc2\xa0 He is, I think, legitimately regarded as an expert when it comes to the security situation in Iraq, so I think it makes a lot of sense for senior administration officials to, on occasion, consult him for advice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And any particular security precautions that you take in this situation, given his legal entanglement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it the position of the administration that Congress cannot change an executive agreement of the type that is contemplated in the Iranian nuclear negotiations?\xc2\xa0 This references the letter from Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is the position of the administration that it is the proper role of the President of the United States to represent the United States in the international community, and to advance our national security interests around the globe.</p>\n<p>And what has been true of this President and every President that has come before him is that they have used that authority that is given to them under the Constitution to execute broad executive agreements with other countries.\xc2\xa0 These take a wide variety of forms, but many of them have substantial consequences for American national security.\xc2\xa0 This is everything from basing agreements with our allies to even the agreement that this administration reached with the Syrians and with the Russians to dispose of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s declared chemical weapons stockpile.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that, contrary to what members said in the letter, that an agreement could not be reversed by the next President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we are saying is that it would be hard to imagine that if Iran were living up to the terms of a good agreement that we have reached \xe2\x80\x93- that is assuming that we are able to reach an agreement -- but if we are able to do so, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to imagine another President coming into office and reversing all of that progress in the face of the international community when we have actually found a way to ease the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>So, again, if Iran is living up to this agreement, then it\xe2\x80\x99s hard -- I think it would be hard to explain why another President would come in and back out of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, still, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the same as saying he couldn\'t do it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I recognize that it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, one other thing.\xc2\xa0 Does anybody in the White House have any knowledge as to whether to two Secret Service agents involved in the incident earlier in the month were under the influence of alcohol at the time?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not aware of that, Bill.\xc2\xa0 But I know that this is an issue that is being investigated by the inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 And so for questions about their inquiry, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to that office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying you don\xe2\x80\x99t know?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but it is being investigated by the inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>James.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, nice to be here.\xc2\xa0 Just on Iran first --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that in the most recent dialogues taking place amongst the P5+1 in Iran that a representative from Iran actually cited the Cotton letter and raised that as an issue during the discussions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of those reports.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position from here to discuss the confidential negotiations that are currently underway in Switzerland, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to confirm that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Without asking you to do that, are you in a position to tell us whether or not, in some form or fashion, the Cotton letter has served even in some appreciable way to damage these talks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, James, what we have said about this is that our biggest concern is about the signal that it sends to our allies that by having this partisan letter out there, a letter that was signed by 47 Republican senators, it might -- and I think understandably -- would raise questions in the mind of our allies about whether the United States can live up to agreements that we make about whether or not we can live up to international agreements that we make.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But apart from whatever signals it may or may not send to our allies, the question put to you here is whether you have any evidence that the Cotton letter is already doing some kind of appreciable damage to the talks themselves.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, based on the fact that many of our allies are involved in these conversations, I can certainly stipulate that we do not believe that this letter was helpful to the process and it did seek to undermine the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to engage in these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 That was, after all, a stated goal of the senators who signed the letter in the first place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it the position of the administration that in order for the P5+1 talks to reach a successful outcome, the parallel track between Iran and the IAEA, which concerns longstanding questions unresolved about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s work in the possible military dimension, must also be successfully resolved?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, James, what we have indicated is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got these very specific concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program that we want to see resolved that specifically would shut off the four pathways to obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That would be augmented by a historically intrusive set of inspections to verify their compliance with the agreement.\xc2\xa0 We would envision a scenario where the experts at the IAEA would be involved in conducting those inspections to verify their compliance.</p>\n<p>But even if an agreement is reached, it will not resolve all of the wide variety of concerns that we have with the Iranian government\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\xc2\xa0 And that includes some of the behavior from their military.\xc2\xa0 It includes some of their menacing of our ally in Israel.\xc2\xa0 And it includes the unjust detention of some American citizens behind bars in Iran.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the answer is, no, the IAEA-Iran track does not have to be successfully resolved in order for the P5+1 track to reach what you regard as a successful outcome?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But it does not mean that all of our concerns would go away.\xc2\xa0 The concerns that have been raised by the IAEA would continue to be concerns that we would take seriously.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what the scope of this agreement is, and if we are able to reach an agreement, it certainly would not ease the long list of other concerns we have about the behavior of the government of Iran.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just quickly on Kerry, and then I have one question about the emails controversy.\xc2\xa0 If I understand the position of the administration correctly following Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s remarks this weekend, it is that President Assad should report to some mutually convenient negotiating table for the presence of ending his own rule in Syria, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 What Secretary Kerry was saying is that he does believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for representatives of the regime to sit down with members of the moderate Syrian opposition to try to make some negotiated decisions about the political transition in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry was referring to Assad as essentially a proxy for the regime.\xc2\xa0 He did not envision a scenario where Assad would himself participate in those conversations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, on the emails controversy, a published report over the weekend in a leading New York newspaper asserted that White House counselor Valerie Jarrett played some role in the disclosures about Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s utter baloney.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very specific answer.\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you, if I can go back to the letter, does the White House see, in terms of their concern about the impact, an appreciable difference between that and Democrats who have come up very publicly in support of review power over the nuclear deal?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the level of concern about the message that sends?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, speaking of baloney, there are a number of members of Congress who have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do we speak of anything else?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe other cold cuts for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s briefing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Corned beef tomorrow.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There have been a number of members of Congress who have repeatedly attempted to suggest that the administration does not envision a role for Congress in consideration of a deal that is reached with Iran if one is reached.\xc2\xa0 And we have said from the beginning that the only way that the sanctions regime that Congress has put in place against Iran can be removed is if Congress votes to remove them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What\xe2\x80\x99s also true, however, is that when Congress passed legislation to put these sanctions into place, they included in that legislation presidential authority to waive some of those sanctions temporarily if the President concluded that it would be in the best interest of the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, the reason that waiver authority is beneficial is it means that if we determine that -- well, there are two reasons.\xc2\xa0 One is, we do not envision a scenario where we would want to automatically, once Iran has signed on the dotted line -- if they sign on the dotted line -- we do not envision a scenario where one of our most powerful weapons against them is immediately taken off the table.\xc2\xa0 What we could envision is a presidential effort to slowly relax them in exchange for Iranian compliance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The benefit of that is, if we determine that Iran is not complying with the agreement, then we can snap those sanctions back into place with the stroke of a pen.\xc2\xa0 Within a day, those sanctions can be quickly put back into place.</p>\n<p>Now, the other thing, though, is that surely Iran would want the certainty of seeing those sanctions not just waived, but totally removed.\xc2\xa0 And the negotiating point here is the administration believes that in order to keep pressure on Iran to ensure they live up to the terms of the agreement that we should keep those sanctions in place for a while, and that after Iran has demonstrated a commitment to complying with the agreement -- not just over the course of days, not over the course of weeks and not over the course of months, but over the longer term -- has demonstrated a willingness to comply with the agreement, then Congress could take what would be the reasonable step of considering whether or not those sanctions should be removed.</p>\n<p>But for now, and certainly in the early days of an agreement, if one is reached, the administration believes we need to keep pressure on Iran and we should keep those sanctions in place, which is why we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that Congress should vote on this right away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern about 60 days to approve or reject any bill?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, something like that would have the effect of raising questions in the minds of the Iranians about whether or not, when the President reaches an agreement with them -- if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reach an agreement -- about whether or not our commitment is good.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t have a situation where you have some people in the Congress backseat-driving.\xc2\xa0 What we need is, we need the support of Congress, as we have enjoyed all along in continuing to consult with the administration as the talks are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And we absolutely -- again, to get back to the baloney -- we absolutely do believe that there is a responsibility for Congress, after Iran has demonstrated sustained compliance with the agreement, to weigh in and make a decision about removing those sanctions.\xc2\xa0 But again, they should not do that until Iran has demonstrated over the long term compliance with this agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can go back to Loretta Lynch for a second.\xc2\xa0 Did the Democrats make a mistake in not pushing for a vote on her last year?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, in an effort to try and find some good faith with incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, acceded to his request to allow the new Senate to consider her nomination.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But as I mentioned earlier, I get asked a lot about whether or not Senator McConnell is a man of his word and whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s lived up to commitments that he makes to the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And for him to suggest that, well, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been that long because Senate Democrats delayed in introducing her until after the first of the year, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a very good sign of faith.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the inept leadership you thought that this represented.\xc2\xa0 And as you well know, McConnell has suggested that it was the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee who unanimously vote for the trafficking bill to send it out; that suddenly it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a doubling back by the Democrats, rather than Republicans who are using this to delay.\xc2\xa0 Why did they all vote for it if they had trouble with the wording?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask Senate Democrats about what their position is.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is they have serious concerns about the inclusion of this controversial element of what is otherwise a common-sense piece of legislation to try and stop child sex trafficking.\xc2\xa0 So this is a common-sense piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t really understand why the Senate Majority Leader wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say to himself, if there is some objection that somebody has to this common-sense bill, let\xe2\x80\x99s remove the objection so we can get it passed and get it signed into law.\xc2\xa0 This is a worthy goal and this is a worthy effort to try to focus the efforts of the federal government and our law enforcement resources on ending child sex trafficking.\xc2\xa0 But again, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to require somebody to demonstrate some leadership in the Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And saving the most important for last:\xc2\xa0 When can we expect the President\xe2\x80\x99s bracket?\xc2\xa0 Has he filled it out yet?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He has not yet, but I would anticipate you\xe2\x80\x99ll see it before tipoff on Thursday morning.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the President pleased to see Vladimir Putin resurface?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t talked to the President about the reappearance of President Putin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the White House have a way to get in touch with the Russian President if it needed to during this time when he was out of the public eye?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any efforts to contact President Putin while he was not in the public eye over the last week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to Syria.\xc2\xa0 Does the President still believe that Assad should go?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 That continues to be the policy of this administration.\xc2\xa0 It is because of President Assad\xe2\x80\x99s failed leadership that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the chaos in Syria that has allowed ISIL to flourish.\xc2\xa0 It is because of the chaos fomented in Syria by Assad\xe2\x80\x99s failed leadership that there are other extremist groups that are seeking to establish a safe haven inside Syria and strike targets in the West and around the globe.\xc2\xa0 So we absolutely hold Assad responsible for that.</p>\n<p>We certainly hold him responsible for the atrocities that he and his military have committed against the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 And it is why we continue to believe that he has lost the legitimacy to lead that country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you don\'t think that he could come in handy some day in terms of taking on ISIS?\xc2\xa0 That component has not been reevaluated in some way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It has not been reevaluated.\xc2\xa0 The administration believes that President Assad has lost legitimacy to lead.\xc2\xa0 We are not in a position of coordinating militarily with him as we strike ISIL targets.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we have gone to some lengths, as has been documented, to ensure that President Assad and his military do not interfere with our efforts to carry out these military airstrikes against ISIL targets in Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the letter that Denis McDonough sent to Senator Corker over the weekend, at one point in the letter the Chief of Staff says, \xe2\x80\x9clet us complete the negotiations.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And he mentions the end of this month, but he also mentions June, which is the deadline for the more comprehensive agreement to be reached.\xc2\xa0 Is he saying that the Congress should wait until June -- until after June to weigh in with any kind of legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, what he is saying very clearly is that Congress should not interfere in this process while negotiations are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And what we have said is that we would expect by the end of March we would expect to be in a position to present a political agreement that has been reached between Iran and the P5+1 partners.\xc2\xa0 And if we cannot, that would be an indication in our minds that Iran is not being reasonable.\xc2\xa0 After all, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been negotiating this for more than a year.\xc2\xa0 And we would be interested in getting together with Congress and with our allies to figure out what more pressure we could apply to Iran to have them participate in these negotiations in a constructive manner.</p>\n<p>But what is also true is that if a political agreement can be reached by the end of March, two things would need to happen. The first is, there are -- as you would expect -- a lot of very specific technical details that need to be reached in terms of essentially codifying this political agreement into a set of very technical expectations about how Iran will come into compliance with the agreement, and we would expect that the experts will need some time to negotiate on those matters.\xc2\xa0 So we would anticipate that negotiation over those technical matters would continue after the end of March.</p>\n<p>But the second thing is I would anticipate that if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reach an agreement at the end of March, the administration and our -- or the United States and our international partners would be in a position to start talking about that political agreement.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the other interesting nature of the debate that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having here, is that there\xe2\x80\x99s not an agreement yet, and for all the hyperventilating that we see on Capitol Hill, there is no agreement that has been reached, and that if we are able to reach an agreement before the end of this month, we will have an opportunity to talk about the details of that political agreement in a way that will allow not just members of Congress but the American public to evaluate the terms of that agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you want any legislation that might be discussed to be held off until June?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There would continue to be --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that realistic to expect Congress to wait that long -- another three months?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned, Jim, Congress will have an opportunity to evaluate the political agreement that has been reached, if one is reached, before the end of March.\xc2\xa0 But, yes, we would expect that Congress would not interfere with ongoing negotiations if we reached the state of engaging in the kinds of technical negotiations that are required to implement the political agreement.</p>\n<p>J.C.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two British leaders within two months\xe2\x80\x99 time -- on Thursday, His Royal Highness Prince Charles will be here in the Oval Office with the Duchess of Cornwall.\xc2\xa0 Will the President be following up any of the discussions he had with Prime Minister Cameron two months ago in terms of defeating ISIL, in terms of the P5+1, et cetera, or will this be more of a social visit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have not yet seen the agenda for the meeting that they\xe2\x80\x99re planning, but I would anticipate that we can get you some more details around their meeting tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick one on the trafficking bill, just to follow up on what Justin was asking.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on this abortion language?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a veto threat from you, so if the Republican leadership were to be able to advance this bill, would the President sign it in its current form?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, what we have said is that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see if the Senate can pass the child sex trafficking bill.\xc2\xa0 And, again, it seems like a pretty common-sense measure.\xc2\xa0 I think Democrats and Republicans can strongly agree that the federal government should be concentrating our efforts to counter child sex trafficking.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that this has become a political partisan controversy in the Senate is a shame, but is entirely consistent with the kind of leadership style that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Senate Republicans in the first eight or so weeks that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the majority.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what\xe2\x80\x99s going to pass the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Right now, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the votes to pass it through the Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been shy about issuing veto threats to legislation that have provisions the President just won\xe2\x80\x99t accept, and this is something that, as you mentioned, a lot of Democrats have felt is inappropriate.\xc2\xa0 So why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he weigh in one way or the other?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President believes is that we should be able to agree -- Democrats and Republicans -- on a piece of legislation that would allow the federal government to concentrate our resources and actually do a good job of fighting child sex trafficking.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s already a lot of work that the President has implemented unilaterally, using his executive authority, to use technology and other law enforcement resources to concentrate this effort.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly welcome legislation that would supplement this ongoing effort.</p>\n<p>And, again, this is something that Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree on.\xc2\xa0 So if what is necessary is for Republicans to take out the controversial provision just so that we can do the good, common-sense work of passing legislation that would fight child sex trafficking, the President would, of course, sign that into law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sign it otherwise?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that this is something that Democrats and Republicans should be able to come together around in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And if the Republican leadership in the majority is willing to demonstrate the leadership that it takes to get this bill passed, then the President would sign it into law, assuming that, again, what Senator McConnell is going to have to do is remove the controversial provision.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just back on Iran for a second.\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify -- you talked about -- Jim was asking about June and the actual negotiating deadline, but you were talking about a much longer period of time that I think you\xe2\x80\x99re saying the White House feels should pass before Congress should take a vote on any agreement after you\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to ascertain whether Iran is abiding by the terms, and sanctions should be lifted altogether.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that seems to envision a vote much longer down the line.\xc2\xa0 Is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position that Congress should wait until later this year, maybe even next year, to vote on an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s being negotiated right now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view that what Congress should do is they should -- if a political agreement is reached before the end of the month, they will have the opportunity to review it.\xc2\xa0 But there should be no interference from Congress while negotiations are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And we have been pretty candid about the fact for a number of months now that if a political agreement is reached in March, it will require additional technical negotiations to ensure that that political agreement can be properly implemented.</p>\n<p>Now, when it comes to Congress weighing in on this agreement, what we envision is a scenario where the statutory sanctions, the congressionally passed sanctions against Iran remain in place for some time -- that that is the way that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to pressure Iran alongside sanctions, to ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re complying with the terms of the international agreement.\xc2\xa0 And that means that it is not necessary for Congress to weigh in on this until Iran has demonstrated not over the course of weeks or months, but over the long term, a willingness to comply with the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then how do you square that with you and the President both saying that Congress has a rightful role to play here?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this agreement would have long since been solidified and finalized before Congress would ever have what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about as their input, their rightful input that the White House believes they should have.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say that, just going back to the Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s letter from over the weekend, that the White House, the Departments of State, Treasury, Energy, Defense and the intelligence community have conducted more than 200 meetings, hearings, classified briefings and calls with members of the House and Senate.\xc2\xa0 More than half of those, more than 100 of those meetings and hearings and calls have taken place just in the last two or three months.\xc2\xa0 So this is an indication that there has been extensive congressional input in this process, as there should be.</p>\n<p>Again, we do hear a lot of rhetoric from Capitol Hill that the administration is somehow trying to prevent Congress from being involved in this process and, as I mentioned earlier, that\xe2\x80\x99s baloney.\xc2\xa0 The fact is there is a role for Congress to play; there has been from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 And there will be an opportunity for Congress to vote after Iran has demonstrated compliance with the terms of the agreement if one is reached.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is simply rooted in the fact that this a really powerful tool that Congress has passed, and they have given the President the authority already to waive those sanctions when he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the country.\xc2\xa0 But the President can\xe2\x80\x99t remove those sanctions -- that\xe2\x80\x99s something that only Congress can do.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that Congress should do that until Iran has demonstrated compliance with the agreement over the long term.</p>\n<p>Dave.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A couple months ago you were talking about the possibility of the President and Senator McConnell having a bourbon summit, and today you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Senator McConnell like he is barely qualified to manage a popsicle stand.\xc2\xa0 Is your extra-heavy criticism today --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let the record reflect that that\xe2\x80\x99s Dave\xe2\x80\x99s observation about Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, not mine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that baloney?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does your extra-heavy criticism today have anything to do with the fact that McConnell signed that letter to Iran last week?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it has everything to do with the fact that Senator McConnell himself suggested that the President not nominate or begin the process for considering Ms. Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s nomination to be attorney general of the United States until after January.\xc2\xa0 But Senator McConnell himself is now using that as an excuse for not acting more promptly on Ms. Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s nomination.\xc2\xa0 And I do think that that calls into question several aspects of his leadership.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a more comprehensive explanation than Eric gave us last week about why the President and the First Lady flew separate planes to Los Angeles on the same day to appear on separate talk shows?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that they flew into different airports.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also my understanding that the First Lady actually left to get back to Washington, D.C. before the President even arrived in California.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a clear indication that their itineraries didn\xe2\x80\x99t link up -- to say nothing of the fact that the President the next day, while the First Lady was in Washington, the President spent a day trip in Arizona before returning to Washington.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the purpose of the taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 expense, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they have arranged it better and saved some money?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Dave, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- again, it does not appear to me that based on the fact that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t fly to the same airport -- she left before he arrived, and she spent the day in Washington while he spent the day in Arizona -- that it was possible to make their schedules align and allow them to travel together.</p>\n<p>I do feel confident in saying that if it had been possible for them to travel together, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99s what they would have preferred to do.</p>\n<p>George.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 One follow-up on Iran.\xc2\xa0 It seems like a stretch that the Republican Congress would vote to lift sanctions on Iran, even if the negotiation, the deal was put into place.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that down the road that could be a stumbling block for this agreement -- that it could be put into place, the sanctions and enforcement could sort of start happening but then the deal could fall apart if the sanctions on the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s behalf aren\xe2\x80\x99t lifted?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, Jordan.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously members of Congress will be in a position to determine for themselves whether or not the sanctions regime should be removed.\xc2\xa0 But the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that it would be a good idea for us to do that unless and until Iran has demonstrated over a longer period of time a commitment to actually living up to the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p>And so, no -- I guess the point is that if Congress were asked right away to remove the sanctions that are in place against Iran, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think a majority of members of the Senate would vote -- or members of Congress would vote to do that.\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing:\xc2\xa0 The President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t support doing that either.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that before we contemplate removing the statutory sanctions against Iran, we need Iran to demonstrate over the long term a commitment to living up to the terms of the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that is why it\xe2\x80\x99s structured this way and I would anticipate that if, over the long term, Iran does demonstrate a willingness to shut down every path that they have to a nuclear weapon, does cooperate with intrusive sanctions that verify their compliance with the agreement, and their continued cooperation in this regard was dependent upon Congress removing the sanctions in the context of the agreement, I do think that would have an impact on the decision that\xe2\x80\x99s made by members of the Senate, both Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But that\xe2\x80\x99s an awful long way down the line, and there will be -- the point is, there will be ample opportunity for members of Congress to both evaluate the political agreement in the short term, to consider the technical agreement that is supposed to be reached by the end of June, and then not over the course of weeks and not over the course of months, but over the long term, evaluate Iran\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to complying with the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p>Jessica, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 A couple of just little ones on Iran.\xc2\xa0 With respect to the U.N. portion of the sanctions, does the President support a lifting of United Nations sanctions against Iran -- beginning the process at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, that is something that, again, as with so many of these technical questions, or detailed questions at least, that\xe2\x80\x99s the subject of ongoing negotiations among our P5+1 partners and Iran.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In addition to sanctions that Congress has put in place against Iran, the United Nations has put sanctions in place against Iran, and the United Nations will at some point have to consider removing those sanctions as well, assuming that will be part of the negotiated agreement with Iran, if one is reached.\xc2\xa0 So, at some point, there likely will have to be action taken at the United Nations, but that\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s still being negotiated into the agreement, and it is the same reason, frankly, that Congress will have to take -- will have to weigh in and be heard on this matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to say whether the President supports the idea of the U.N. lifting them?\xc2\xa0 Inherently, keeping up the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s and P5+1\xe2\x80\x99s end of the bargain, they would have to go.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, well, if they do this, then they have to do that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s being negotiated in Switzerland right now between Iran and the United States and our P5+1 partners.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about this idea that\xe2\x80\x99s been circulating that lifting the U.N. sanctions could in some way circumvent Congress\xe2\x80\x99s ability for the necessity to lift sanctions.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House view on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The White House view on that is it is very clear that there is only one way to remove sanctions put in place by Congress, and that is for Congress to vote to remove them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, just from a technical perspective, is there any estimate or working estimate on how long?\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s so many layers, and so even once you start the process, it could take -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s any estimate on how long it could take, because there\xe2\x80\x99s multiple layers just on the U.S. alone -- the U.N., executive orders, congressional sanctions, agency -- Treasury sanctions -- on how long it would take to unravel all the sanctions that the U.S. --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again the pace of -- obviously, the kinds of commitments that Iran is willing to make when it comes to shutting down every path they have to a nuclear weapon and submitting to historically intrusive inspections will be an exchange for sanctions relief.\xc2\xa0 And so this is the essence of the negotiation, is what steps will Iran take and for how long will they maintain those steps, in exchange for the pace of sanctions relief.</p>\n<p>And the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that the congressional sanctions that have been put in place are one of the more powerful tools that we have in this whole rack-up.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that we should take that really powerful tool off the table on the front end.\xc2\xa0 He believes that we should do that nearer to the end, after Iran has demonstrated over the course of a sustained period of time a willingness to live up to the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when you talk about Congress\xe2\x80\x99s permission within the sanctions language for the President to temporarily waive them, there\xe2\x80\x99s that ability, but then there\xe2\x80\x99s also these executive-level implemented sanctions.\xc2\xa0 So when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the concept of the President waiving anything, are we talking about both sort of pots of sanctions relief that are being contemplated, or are we just talking about the temporary waiving of the congressional ones?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, those are two different things.\xc2\xa0 And again, this will be part of the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Again, Iran is going to commit to taking some steps.\xc2\xa0 Iran is going to commit to intrusive inspections, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll do so in exchange for some sanctions relief.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to give them all the sanctions relief at the beginning.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to wait over a period of time so that Iran can demonstrate their sustained compliance with this agreement.\xc2\xa0 And as Iran, over the course of time, commits to these -- or fulfills these commitments, then the international community will respond by following through on the commitments that we have made to offer sanctions relief.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the onus in this situation is going to be on the Iranians to demonstrate their willingness to comply with the terms of the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And in exchange, the international community will start to take steps in a phased pattern of offering sanctions relief.\xc2\xa0 But again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that we envision happening in the short term; that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen over the long term as Iran demonstrates sustained compliance with the agreement, if an agreement is reached.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can just press you -- I think that point is amply made, but what I haven\'t heard from you is these executive-level, can he waive -- I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re executive-level sanctions, so he could take those off the table.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99re executive sanctions that the President has the authority to waive, then that will be part of the negotiated agreement.\xc2\xa0 And as you point out, the legislation that Congress passed, putting in place the sanctions, included in there presidential waiver authority.\xc2\xa0 It did give the President the authority, in the context of that legislation, to waive the sanctions if the President believed that it was in the best interest of our national security.</p>\n<p>And in the context of an agreement, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President would contemplate doing.\xc2\xa0 But he would not envision a scenario where we would remove those sanctions until Congress has had the opportunity to vote on it.\xc2\xa0 And the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that we should remove those sanctions, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that Congress should vote on it until Iran has demonstrated sustained compliance with the agreement, if an agreement is reached.</p>\n<p>Mara, did you have something else before I go?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to clear up one thing.\xc2\xa0 You keep on referring to it as a political agreement, and last week Kerry said this is not a legally binding agreement.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that the President can negotiate on his own that is legally binding, other than a treaty, which has to be approved by Congress -- the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important is for us to recognize that the stakes for Iran and their compliance with the agreement, if one is reached, are sky-high.\xc2\xa0 The sanctions regime that\xe2\x80\x99s been put in place has had a decimating impact on their economy.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen the evidence that indicates that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s leadership is under pretty serious political pressure inside their country to get sanctions relief.\xc2\xa0 That is the leverage that the international community has to get Iran to comply with the terms of any agreement that they sign.</p>\n<p>The point here is that in the eyes of Iran, when it comes to the commitments that they make, I assure you the Iranians feel like the commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99re making are very binding, because their failure to live up to the terms of the agreement would result in this sanctions regime that has decimated their economy from snapping immediately back into place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what about from our point of view?\xc2\xa0 Because he said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t legally binding in answer to the letter suggesting that another President could overrule it if they wanted to.\xc2\xa0 If there anything the President can do on his own, short of an actual treaty, that is legally binding?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty technical legal question.\xc2\xa0 But I think the point that I made to Bill is relevant in answer to your question, which is that if we do see a scenario where Iran does reach an agreement with the international community, they satisfy the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns as it relates to their pathways to a bomb that they satisfy the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns in terms of allowing inspectors regular access to their nuclear facilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We will essentially resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with their nuclear problem, and will, for the foreseeable future, as those inspections remain in place.\xc2\xa0 I would be very surprised that an incoming U.S. President would want to unravel all of that -- I guess I would be very surprised if an incoming U.S. President wanted to unravel all of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even though they could legally?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s a question for a lawyer.\xc2\xa0 They can explain to you what sort of legal authority they have.\xc2\xa0 But I think as a purely practical matter, if the international community has reached this agreement with Iran, and we can verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the agreement, and the international community is onboard with the enforcement of that agreement, then I would be very surprised that an incoming U.S. President would unravel all of that.\xc2\xa0 All right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Mark.\xc2\xa0 Last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why not pursue a treaty?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of the legal difference between all of these things, I\xe2\x80\x99m far outside my field of expertise on that front.\xc2\xa0 I think the point is that the United States can obtain the commitments that we need from Iran, in partnership with the international community, without a treaty.\xc2\xa0 And for the reasons that I explained to Mara, they\xe2\x80\x99re making very serious commitments, and I assure you that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s leadership understands the stakes if they don\xe2\x80\x99t live up to the terms of the agreement.\xc2\xa0 They have already come to the negotiating table to try to get the international community to relieve the sanctions regime that\xe2\x80\x99s in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s been some talk about sort of this notion of what\xe2\x80\x99s legally binding, but I assure you that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership understands the consequences of breaking this agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said in your answer to me earlier here today, you essentially sketched out a scenario whereby if an agreement is reached it satisfies everyone\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about these different pathways to a bomb, and yet these outstanding questions about the possible military dimension of their program are left for some future resolution, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve already been at that for almost a decade.</p>\n<p>When you say to us, gee, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been negotiating for a year, we should have a good idea of whether it\'s going to come to fruition, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we have a good idea, A, that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to come to fruition on the IAEA PMD track?\xc2\xa0 And also, you cannot satisfy everybody\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about the pathways if that IAEA PMD track is left out there unresolved.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do think that under the kind of agreement -- well, let me say one thing.\xc2\xa0 The first is, we can certainly evaluate that argument if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And we can look at the terms and determine whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99ve succeeded in resolving the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns -- if we\xe2\x80\x99ve shut down the pathway at Natanz; if we\xe2\x80\x99ve shut down the effort at Iraq, the heavy water reactor there that\xe2\x80\x99s using plutonium; if we have succeeded in shutting down the pathway to a bomb at Fordow; and if we\xe2\x80\x99ve put in place these intrusive inspections that would allow us to -- that would ease our concerns about a covert path to a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>The point is we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity in the context of the agreement to evaluate whether or not people\xe2\x80\x99s concerns have been met when it comes to their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a long list of concerns about other things that Iran does that relates to their ballistic missile program, that relates to their continued menacing of Israel.\xc2\xa0 I failed to mention earlier, their continued support for terrorism around the globe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In other words, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying we can meet all these concerns, but we can carve out the PMD.\xc2\xa0 The PMD is not about Israel or ballistic missiles, or about terror or support for Hezbollah or Hamas.\xc2\xa0 The PMD is on the nuclear program.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity once the agreement is reached to see what impact that agreement would have on the PMD track.\xc2\xa0 But again, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t reached an agreement yet, so that\xe2\x80\x99s where we would go.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:10 P.M.
