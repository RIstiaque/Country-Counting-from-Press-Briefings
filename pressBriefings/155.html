Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t2:05 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Happy Monday.\xc2\xa0 Let me start with a couple of brief comments before we go to your questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many of you had the opportunity to watch and report on the President\xe2\x80\x99s address to the nation last night where he talked about the significance of the terror threat and the national security threat facing the United States, and he walked through an overview of the steps that this administration has taken on his orders over the last year to combat this threat and to secure the homeland.\xc2\xa0 Included in the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments in his address were some steps that Congress could take to assist this effort.\xc2\xa0 Let me mention one thing that he did not.\xc2\xa0 Congress needs to pass a budget on time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tShutting down the government is not going to enhance our national security.\xc2\xa0 There are also some Republicans who are suggesting that they may need some additional time and therefore would pass a continuing resolution to fund the government at current levels. \xc2\xa0The fact is the reason that we don\'t want to fund the government at current levels is because the budget agreement includes necessary and adequate funding for our national security.\xc2\xa0 So passing a continuing resolution because Congress is unable to come to an agreement on the budget agreement is only going to underfund our national security efforts.\xc2\xa0 It seems like a pretty bad time to be doing that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, once again, it is the responsibility of Congress to step forward and do their job and pass a budget for the United States government on time.\xc2\xa0 And that is going to require Republicans in Congress abandoning their ongoing effort to advance their ideological agenda through the budgetary process.\xc2\xa0 There continue to be negotiations that are bogged down by the repeated inclusion on the part of Republicans of ideological riders that in some cases are nothing more than earmarks to their largest campaign contributors.\xc2\xa0 When our national security is at stake, that\'s not the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, Julie, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just pick up on that, Josh.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Great.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to Speaker Ryan?\xc2\xa0 As far as we know, they haven\'t met face to face since Speaker Ryan took office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve had the opportunity to speak a number of times, but it\'s correct that they haven\'t had any meetings.\xc2\xa0 This is a process right now that rests with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But certainly you\'re an influential party in this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No doubt.\xc2\xa0 In fact, that\'s how I have the knowledge that I do to be able to speak about the ongoing process.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, Speaker Ryan is the leader of a substantial majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives and Senator McConnell is the leader of a substantial majority of Republicans in the United States Senate, and they have a significant responsibility to work with Democrats to advance a bipartisan budget agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact is the hard work got done earlier this fall, and some of that was thanks to the influence of at least Leader McConnell, who was in a leadership role at that time.\xc2\xa0 So the hard work has been done.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just time to finish the job and to do so before the end of the week.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Moving on to Chicago.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any response to the Justice Department opening an investigation into use of force by the Chicago Police Department?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do not.\xc2\xa0 The decision to open a pattern of practice investigation that the Attorney General announced earlier today is a decision that is made by prosecutors at the Department of Justice and this is an independent decision that they made.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And obviously there is important work and serious responsibilities that they have in conducting an investigation like that, and I\'m confident that investigators at the Department of Justice are up to the task.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know you were asked about this last weekend and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a clear answer.\xc2\xa0 Has the President talked to Rahm Emanuel -- not about the Justice Department investigation, specifically, but the broader situation in Chicago?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then one quick follow-up on the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks last night on encryption.\xc2\xa0 He said -- a pretty vague line in his speech -- he said he would \xe2\x80\x9curge high-tech and law enforcement to make it harder for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 It seems kind of like a throw-away line on a pretty important topic.\xc2\xa0 Is there something behind the scenes, some actual process?\xc2\xa0 I know we heard on a call yesterday that the administration is not going to be pursuing any kind of legislative avenue on this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, let me first assure you that this has been a priority of the administration for some time.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t describe it as a throw-away line as much as --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was pretty vague.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, but, Julie, we\'re talking about a 13-minute speech where the President covered a lot of ground.\xc2\xa0 So the President made a point of acknowledging this fact because it is significant and something that the administration has been focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall -- and I think you may have even covered this -- when the President traveled to Stanford back in February, where he convened a cybersecurity summit, there were intensive discussions about this issue of encryption among leaders in academia and the private sector and, of course, law enforcement. And there are equities to balance here, that we, of course -- and the President believes in the importance of strong encryption, but at the same time, as the President mentioned last night, we don\'t want terrorists to have a safe haven in cyberspace.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to make sure we\'re understanding this right.\xc2\xa0 Does he see this as something that needs to have more robust attention and focus behind it because of the attacks in Paris and in California, or is it kind of just continuing a process that has already been underway?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point of the investigation, I haven\'t heard the FBI say anything about what impact enhanced capabilities in this area on the part of law enforcement would have done in terms of preventing something like this.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of the need to ensure that law enforcement professionals and our national security professionals have access to the tools they need to keep us safe.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeff.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, does the White House have a reaction to the elections in Venezuela?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Obviously I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports about them, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve garnered a lot of attention.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of State noted earlier today the significance of these elections.\xc2\xa0 And I think what is clear is that the people of Venezuela have expressed their overwhelming desire for a change in direction.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary is for all of the parties involved to engage in a dialogue about the future of that country mindful of the election results.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a process that we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly continue to watch closely from here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President optimistic that this will help improve the relationship between Washington and Venezuela?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s something -- I think that remains to be seen.\xc2\xa0 But obviously the strong levels of participation and the overwhelming expression of a desire for change is encouraging and something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll watch closely.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said last night that there would be a review of the K1 fianc\xc3\xa9 visa.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain a little bit about what will be involved in that review?\xc2\xa0 Is there a timeline for that?\xc2\xa0 Are there changes that the President or the White House can make without congressional backing, or do you expect to get Congress involved in that, as well?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff -- well, let me back up and just say that the President -- the reference that the President made last night was to the visa program that the female terrorist in the San Bernardino case used to enter the country.\xc2\xa0 This is what\xe2\x80\x99s known as a K1 visa, as you point out, and this is often a visa that is essentially used to allow fianc\xc3\xa9s of American citizens to enter the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those who go through this visa program are subjected to rigorous screening, but obviously this incident begs questions about whether or not additional measures or reforms need to be implemented.\xc2\xa0 This is a program that includes both DHS and State Department input.\xc2\xa0 I believe that the way that this works is that you apply for this program through the State Department -- because obviously you have to do it from overseas -- but then when it is implemented, it involves the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 So both agencies will be taking a close look at the roles that they have in this program and obviously determine what kinds of reforms would strengthen our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When did the President ask for this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President just announced it in his speech yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So did he ask for it yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Speaking of reviews, this DHS terror advisory system change, can you talk a little bit more about that?\xc2\xa0 What exactly is it going to look like?\xc2\xa0 Is it actually going to do anything useful, or is it sort of a move that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily going to pay attention to?\xc2\xa0 How do you want to get people to pay attention to it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So, Michelle, this is a reference to NTAS, the National Terrorism Advisory System.\xc2\xa0 This is a system that has been in place for several years now.\xc2\xa0 It was essentially designed as a reform of the color-coded terror alert system that the Bush administration put in place.\xc2\xa0 And the kinds of reforms that are being considered are reforms to this specific system that would make it easier and, frankly, more effective for the Department of Homeland Security to communicate with the public about what threats have been perceived, what steps are being taken to mitigate those threats, and recommend any steps that we believe that the public should take.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So these are still reforms that are being considered.\xc2\xa0 You should not consider this a replacement of this program but rather some important reforms to the program that would allow it to be more effectively used to communicate with the American public.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because I think if you ask just about anybody on the street what is the terror alert now, and is it a color or is it some other designation, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know how many people would know.\xc2\xa0 But does it matter?\xc2\xa0 Is this something you\xe2\x80\x99ve put out and if people want to find it they can?\xc2\xa0 Or are you feeling like now it needs to be at a level where more people do know about it, kind of a greater dissemination of this information somehow?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Michelle -- I think, frankly, it depends on the circumstances in which guidance or an alert is being issued.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, if an alert is being issued, then we definitely want people to pay attention and for there to be broadness -- broad awareness of it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the goal of these reforms is to give the Department of Homeland Security a mechanism for more effectively communicating with the American public about threats that are perceived.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve highlighted a couple of ways in which that program could be improved.\xc2\xa0 This is a process that actually -- this is not a review that has just been commenced; this is actually a review that\xe2\x80\x99s been underway for some time.\xc2\xa0 And I know that Secretary Johnson indicated earlier today that he expected the results of that review to be released relatively soon.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And lastly, what is your response to some of the reaction that was expected to come right after the President\xe2\x80\x99s address, especially from Republican candidates, saying that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything new; is this all there is; it\xe2\x80\x99s just a couple of bombs each day, that\xe2\x80\x99s not really going to defeat ISIS?\xc2\xa0 And again, every time he speaks it\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep coming up that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say radical Islamic terrorism; he called it an \xe2\x80\x9cact of terror,\xe2\x80\x9d but he\xe2\x80\x99s not wanting to say Islamic.\xc2\xa0 Are you feeling like that is just going to be overly broad and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to exacerbate the problem, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned?\xc2\xa0 Or is it to the point that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to say it because people are -- his opponents are calling for him to say it?\xc2\xa0 What would be the harm of actually saying that one word?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Michelle, I think this -- the President essentially covered this in the last four or five paragraphs of his address last night.\xc2\xa0 So I think for careful consideration of this issue, I\'d encourage people to go back and look at that part of the speech again.\xc2\xa0 The President made clear, as his predecessor did, that it would only serve ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s interest to leave people with the impression that somehow the West or the United States or the entire world is at war with Islam.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a fantasy.\xc2\xa0 That is not true.\xc2\xa0 There are millions of patriotic Muslims in America right now that are outstanding members of their community, that are serving in the United States military, that are teachers, that are coworkers, that are neighbors, that are friends.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think the President was quite direct about the role that those Muslim Americans can play in defeating ISIL, both in terms of the responsibility that the Muslim community has to stand up and speak out against those extremist voices inside their community.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, the broader American community has a responsibility to make clear that we\'re going to work with Muslim Americans to protect our country and to protect those in their community that are at risk of being radicalized.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Calling it an individual act of terror, an act of radical Islamic terror, that would indicate that we\'re at war with all of Islam?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly would advance ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s narrative that somehow they were acting on behalf of Islam when, in fact, as the President noted yesterday, that the ideology that they are seeking to advance is a gross perversion of that religion.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I have two different subjects I want to ask you about.\xc2\xa0 First, what are the new parameters in place now that have to be followed for the relationship with the President and Rahm Emanuel in light of the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s investigation?\xc2\xa0 What can they say to each other? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s off the table?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not aware of any -- let me say it this way, April -- the President is not going to be involved in the ongoing Department of Justice investigation, so I\'m not aware of any limits that this would impose on his communications with the Mayor.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not supposed to talk about investigations -- by law, he\'s not supposed to talk about investigations with the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 So would that also not allow him to talk about anything as it relates to the investigation with Rahm?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll just say that the President believes in protecting the integrity of this ongoing investigation and he\'ll ensure that his comments both in public and in private don\'t do anything to undermine the integrity of that important investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President last night talked about the no-fly issue for terrorists.\xc2\xa0 Is he aware of this bill that\'s in the House Judiciary Committee that is basically an act of Congress that would update the terrorist watch list to put new people on, to put young people in this country who are not on the old list\xc2\xa0 -- that would essentially put them on that list so it would be a new no-fly list, so if they go over to fight in Syria they\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed to come back here if they\xe2\x80\x99re on that list.\xc2\xa0 What does the President and this White House feel about that bill that\'s working its way through the House Judiciary Committee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen that bill, so we\'ll have to get back to you if we have a specific position on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that along the lines of what he was talking about last night?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'d want to learn more about the bill before I commented on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s address last night included a call for national unity.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you\'re surprised that there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been that kind of unity as you may have seen in previous attacks -- for example, after 9/11.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a thought-provoking question, actually. I don\'t think I carefully considered it. \xc2\xa0I guess there are two things that immediately come to mind.\xc2\xa0 The first is something I think that the President noted directly.\xc2\xa0 The President referred to that national unity in the context, as I recall, of being part of every element of America\xe2\x80\x99s capability to protect the country; that one of the things that makes America so strong and so powerful and so influential is the fact that we\'re a very diverse country that is very united around a set of core principles, and that only serves to enhance our national security, but it also makes us the greatest country in the world.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the first thing that comes to mind.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the second thing that comes to mind is that a lot of these issues are being discussed in the context of a hotly competitive presidential election, and we have seen a willingness on the part of some candidates in that election to use some divisive rhetoric.\xc2\xa0 And they have done that I think in a rather cynical fashion, understanding that it runs contrary to the values of our country, but also understanding that the intensity of some of those emotions could propel their political campaigns.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s a pretty cynical conclusion that I think some might say is automatically disqualifying to serve in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 But obviously the American people will make that determination.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In a more general way, how is the President feeling this morning about the speech, the morning after?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t spoken to him this morning about the speech, but I spoke to him last night after he delivered the speech and I think he was pleased with the way that the process had come together, and that his goal was to speak before a large audience of the American public to address the concerns that are obviously being felt across the country, for good reason, about the threat of terrorism, and he felt it was an important occasion last night to help the American people understand exactly what steps this administration is taking to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, to secure the homeland, and to fulfill the President\xe2\x80\x99s top objective, which is to keep the American people safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I ask because the reaction has been in some ways very negative.\xc2\xa0 It\'s been that the moment was lost.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I strongly disagree with that.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at -- I mean, again, it\'s going to be arbitrary, we\'re all just going to be citing sort of one-off instances, but if you look at the -- I had an opportunity to look at the headlines on the front pages of newspapers all across the country about the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll get them for you.\xc2\xa0 I think this is worthy of inclusion in your news report tonight.\xc2\xa0 They do --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think the reaction has been positive?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I just look at the news coverage and I think what the reaction has been has been consistent with the message that the President himself delivered.\xc2\xa0 This is a serious topic and the President began his speech by talking about 14 innocent Americans who lost their lives.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the American people and the news coverage, at least in most outlets, reflecting exactly what the President was trying to communicate, we feel good about the results.\xc2\xa0 I think the President does, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because I was struck by a lot of reporting, a lot of analysis of it was --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The analysis I think is risky, Ron.\xc2\xa0 It\'s risky, buddy.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- this is where we are, there was nothing new, that there was no grand proposal, that it was -- you hear there was no strategy, that, again, that he used the Oval Office for the third time in his tenure and on a Sunday night and this is all we get, was what some of the narrative was.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mostly from people who are political opponents of the President.\xc2\xa0 Again --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\'s just politics?\xc2\xa0 Is that the point\xc2\xa0 -- I\'m asking a serious question.\xc2\xa0 The point is I have to think that there\xe2\x80\x99s got to be some sense of the President that regardless of what he says he\'s not going to convince some people, but does he feel like he\'s not getting a fair hearing on this?\xc2\xa0 Does he -- he really feels like he said something that should have moved this whole dialogue forward, that should have been reassuring to the American public?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President\xe2\x80\x99s political opponents are not going to be satisfied, and that\'s okay.\xc2\xa0 That\'s part of the process; that\'s part of an election; that\'s part of people who are competing to win the support of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\'s disappointing sometimes when it takes place in the context of national security issues and often takes place without any regard for facts or evidence.\xc2\xa0 But if we spent a lot of time worried or focused on that, we\xe2\x80\x99d be focused on the wrong thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me finish.\xc2\xa0 What the President was focused on last night was speaking before a large television audience of the American public to, again, describe to them exactly what steps this administration has taken for more than a year now to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL in Syria and Iraq, to protect the homeland, and to ensure that we\'re following through on the kinds of steps that are necessary to protect the public, and doing that in a way that both reflects the lessons learned of our recent history but also reinforces the values that are critical to our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s the thing -- you said it -- it\'s been more than a year, and now at the end of this year or so you\xe2\x80\x99ve had Paris and San Bernardino, despite the strategy, and even though it\'s being amped up or stepped up, I think people are wondering isn\'t there more, something else that can be done, if after a year this is what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 Is it inevitable that with the strategy -- and the President says it\'s going to take some time\xc2\xa0 -- so is it inevitable that there are going to be these Paris and San Bernardino style attacks?\xc2\xa0 I certainly wouldn\'t think that he would accept that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He does not.\xc2\xa0 And I think that he said on a number of occasions that he will not allow this to become the new normal or some part of some routine.\xc2\xa0 The President is determined to ensure that that\'s not the case.\xc2\xa0 But as you point out, when the President first ordered military action against ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria more than a year ago, he acknowledged that this would be a process that would take some time, principally because the President was not going to commit U.S. ground troops to a sustained ground combat operation inside of Iraq and in Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as the President described yesterday, or last night, this is one of the lessons that we hopefully have learned from our recent history, that our victory -- and we will prevail -- but our victory will be more long-lasting and enduring if we pursue the strategy that the President has outlined, which is building up the capacity of local security forces to fight for their own country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last one.\xc2\xa0 That\'s another part of this.\xc2\xa0 I think we heard a lot about the military part of this in Syria and the coalition, Special Ops, so on and so on and so forth.\xc2\xa0 The attack in San Bernardino, though, as the Attorney General and others have said, signals this new phenomenon, this new problem\xc2\xa0 -- it\'s really not that new, but it\'s different -- the self-radicalization of people by what they\xe2\x80\x99re reading on the Internet and cyberspace.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think we heard a lot about exactly what the strategy is to deal with that, to stop exactly what seems to have happened in San Bernardino, an American citizen, his wife reading this stuff on the Internet and then deciding to go out and arm themselves and kill their coworkers.\xc2\xa0 What is the strategy to deal with that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President did spend some time, and I think this is one portion of the speech where he did talk at length about the things we have to be sure we don\'t do in terms of making sure that the United States as a whole, both our government, our law enforcement and the community at large, seeks to work with the Muslim community in this country.\xc2\xa0 Again, American Muslims serve in our military and put their lives on the line to protect the country.\xc2\xa0 They serve in law enforcement.\xc2\xa0 They are our teachers; they are our coworkers; they are our neighbors; they are our friends.\xc2\xa0 And continuing to strengthen the role and the place that those Muslims have in American society is critical to our success.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause ultimately, it will be Muslims in this country that will have to stand up and speak out against the extremist radicalizing forces inside their own community.\xc2\xa0 And they will be more effective if they are working in close partnership with the federal government and with law enforcement and with our counterterrorism professionals, and with our neighbors to fight those kinds of forces.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there are some additional steps, there are additional steps that the federal government has taken to pursue this effort to counter violent extremism.\xc2\xa0 And some of this is our efforts that are underway overseas.\xc2\xa0 I mentioned this a little bit last week -- the creation of international CT and CVE clearinghouse mechanisms.\xc2\xa0 These are essentially resources located in countries around the world -- Muslim countries, as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect, in most cases -- that are responsible for countering the effort of extremist organizations to radicalize people around the globe.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here at home, the federal government has supported pilot projects in cities like Boston, Los Angeles and the Twin Cities where law enforcement both at the federal and local levels have worked with community leaders in the Muslim community, but in other communities, too, to build strong connections, to counter sort of radicalizing messaging of extremists, but also to reach out to those who are at risk of being radicalized, and giving them an alternative opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there are no easy answers to this, but there is a strategy that we can implement that we are optimistic will succeed in making the country safer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m familiar with the program in Minneapolis.\xc2\xa0 To follow up on this question from earlier, what more is there about this law enforcement tech industry, not just on the issue of encryption -- what does the President foresee happening -- monitoring Twitter?\xc2\xa0 Monitoring YouTube?\xc2\xa0 What exactly is the extent of that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a question that tech companies I think are largely going to have to answer for themselves.\xc2\xa0 They will do that in the context of a conversation with law enforcement and with government experts.\xc2\xa0 But, obviously, social media sites like Facebook and Twitter recognize that their tools were created in the context of an open society, and the kind of atmosphere that allowed them to innovate and to create new technologies that have allowed people to establish relationships even if they\xe2\x80\x99re divided by time and space is powerful, and is successful only in the context of an open society.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they, at the same time, have their own interest in not seeing these tools be used to incite or radicalize or call for people to carry out acts of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 Of course, they have a responsibility that they obviously believe strongly in, which is protecting free speech.\xc2\xa0 But these are the kinds of discussions that the Obama administration and technology companies, particularly social media companies, have been engaged in for some time now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Major.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, going back to your opening statement, just to be clear, will the President veto a CR if the congressional Republicans are not -- completed their work by the end of this week?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear -- and he said this when he signed the last CR -- that he would not sign another CR like the one that he did earlier this fall, which is to say the one that he -- the continuing resolution he signed this fall was to give Congress additional time to negotiate a bipartisan budget agreement, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the CR wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just a couple of weeks, but it was actually a couple of months, to give them ample time to sit down -- Democrats and Republicans -- and hammer out the topline numbers, and then work through the individual numbers below that.\xc2\xa0 And the President was quite clear at that point that he would not sign another one like that.\xc2\xa0 And that continues to be his position today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, there might be a scenario --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- one that is consistent with the spending levels that are currently understood and negotiated, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t have $1.1 trillion in spending.\xc2\xa0 You are moving in that direction, but they need three more days.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with that larger envelope, if you will, of spending, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the full deal.\xc2\xa0 Will he sign that to avert a shutdown?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard anybody float that proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not floating one, I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to float something.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m trying to figure out, if Friday midnight is the deadline, absolutely end of story, and you have your work done by then or there will be a government shutdown.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is the deadline.\xc2\xa0 The one thing that I would hold out is that if there is some sort of negotiation that yields a breakthrough and an agreement is reached at, say, 11:30 on Friday night, and House and Senate leaders say --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a matter of drafting and enrolling and all that, procedural only.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 So the way that I\xe2\x80\x99d describe this is, the President is not going to sign a CR that will give members of Congress additional time to negotiate.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s essentially sort of where we are.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned ideological riders.\xc2\xa0 Can you stipulate what those are?\xc2\xa0 What falls into that category and what does not?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess this is one of those things that when you see it, you know it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Syrian refugees -- yes or no?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to walk through all of the -- there are dozens of proposals that are floating around Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dodd-Frank changes?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that the President is not supportive of targeting Syria refugees, orphans or widows.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that he is not going to sign legislation that undermines the effective implementation of Wall Street reform legislation.\xc2\xa0 So our position on all of these matters is quite clear and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut ultimately, what we would like to see is Republicans in Congress engage in a process that is genuinely bipartisan.\xc2\xa0 Because this is the thing about that, Major -- if Republicans do insert a rider that undermines the effective implementation of Wall Street reform, I recognize that that is something that is strongly supported by the biggest contributors to the Republican National Committee, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to pass the United States Senate because Democrats are not going to go along with it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the other reason here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just the President\xe2\x80\x99s objection to ideological riders; it\xe2\x80\x99s that if Republicans try to pass a budget bill along party lines, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to work.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody who can testify to that better than former Speaker of the House John Boehner.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President, last night, described the actions he would like Congress to take on gun control as a \xe2\x80\x9cmatter of national security.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 There was a lively exchange last week about whether or not any of the President\xe2\x80\x99s initiatives would have stopped or prevented what happened in San Bernardino.\xc2\xa0 You could see that there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence that there would have.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why the President chose to place those initiatives in the context of national security when the preceding incident that is most on the minds of the country has no relevance to that argument.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Those who might levy that criticism, are they suggesting that we should wait for somebody who is on the no-fly list to go buy a gun and kill a bunch of innocent Americans and then we should pass a law?\xc2\xa0 Is that what we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the question I asked.\xc2\xa0 The question I asked is why the President described this as a matter of national security in a speech built around an episode, a massacre that has raised concerns and a sense of anxiety in the country?\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a national security context, and yet there\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Major --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to answer.\xc2\xa0 The country is not just concerned about what happened in San Bernardino.\xc2\xa0 The country is concerned about the potential risk of terrorism in this country.\xc2\xa0 And right now, we do not have a law on the books that prevents people who are on the no-fly list from being able to walk into a gun store and purchasing a gun.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes it is in our national security interest to make sure that people who the government has determined are too dangerous to board a plane, to stop them from buying a gun.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how would you respond to those who believe that there are if not serial inaccuracies on that no-fly list, there are enough inaccuracies on that list that that must be corrected before you can have a law of the kind the President is now suggesting?\xc2\xa0 And I understand the Bush administration also proposed -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a new idea.\xc2\xa0 I would just like you to address that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that the United States government has made enhancements to DHS\xe2\x80\x99s Traveler Redress Inquiry Program.\xc2\xa0 This is essentially the way that if people believe that they are wrongly included on the no-fly list, that they can go through the process of having their name cleared.\xc2\xa0 So there is a process established here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the other thing about this.\xc2\xa0 If the government has determined that in the interest of national security that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to deprive you of your rights to board an airplane just like anybody else, then I think it follows and is common sense that we\xe2\x80\x99re also going to deprive you of your right to buy a gun just like everybody else until such time as you\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to satisfy any concerns that the federal government has about your links to terrorism.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question -- and you were talking a little bit to Ron about this -- when the President brought up encryption, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t talking about monitoring YouTube and Facebook and Twitter.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talking about something new, a different topic about dark apps and things that are undetectable under current methods, right?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the conversation you would like to open and at least get tech companies engaged in offering either suggestions or openness, correct?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s driving at?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The truth is, he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about both.\xc2\xa0 And there is this concern that essentially relates to our ability to investigate and prevent acts of terrorism that there are some terrorists or potential terrorists, would-be terrorists, who are exploiting encrypted technology to prevent essentially the government from being able to --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes -- to determine what it is they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about in apps to prevent them from carrying out an act of violence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The point that we have made here is that the President believes strongly in good encryption and strong encryption, that that\xe2\x80\x99s important to protecting our civil liberties.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, the people who have designed these communications tools certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t design them to aid and abet a terrorist.\xc2\xa0 So there should be some common ground that the government and technology companies can find to address this concern and to make sure that the American people are safe.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing -- is there anything in the investigation that suggests to the President that the K1 visa process was not fully carried out in the case of Tashfeen Malik?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The way that this woman entered the United States is something that is still under investigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but to mention -- because it is an exhaustive process.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s six months to two years, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lengthy questionnaire; a follow-up in-person interview.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that he\xe2\x80\x99s learned in all the various briefings he\xe2\x80\x99s had that that process wasn\xe2\x80\x99t carried out to its fullest extent and, therefore, the existing procedures need to be tightened up?\xc2\xa0 Or does this need to be -- do there need to be more procedures added on to the substantial ones that already exist?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I understand it, both of those are questions that are still being asked about what were the circumstances, what was the screening to which this individual was --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To order the review, something must have tripped that, the need to have this reviewed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think in the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind, he saw that this individual entered the country -- and I think it raises legitimate, common-sense questions about whether or not that program needs to be changed as a result.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s asking the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to consider.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mara.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To the extent that the President did talk about some new strategies to confront this new kind of threat, he said two things.\xc2\xa0 One is this idea of denying terrorists this online space to recruit.\xc2\xa0 And you just said that this is a question that tech companies are going to largely have to answer for themselves.\xc2\xa0 I mean, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you demanding something?\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want something specific from these tech companies?\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there some kind of urgency?\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you have something in mind?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been the subject of extensive conversation.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the rest of the answer that you quoted from there underscored.\xc2\xa0 But the point that I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make here, Mara, is that YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and these other social media tools, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t design their tools expressly so that terrorists could carry out acts of violence against innocent people; they don\xe2\x80\x99t want their tools used in that way.\xc2\xa0 And so they have their own interest in making sure that these tools are used properly, consistent with both the First Amendment right of Americans, consistent with the privacy of their users, but also consistent with the national security of the country that created an environment where tools like this could be invented.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re saying why it should be in their interest, too, but what specifically do you want them to do?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is the subject of ongoing conversation among law enforcement professionals, among academics and others about how to resolve these questions about rights -- about free speech rights, about personal privacy, but also about protecting the country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hillary Clinton gave a speech the other day where she said we have to deny them online space.\xc2\xa0 Do you want these websites and chatrooms shut down?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we want is these companies to continue to play an active role in working with the government to, again, as the President described, to deny them a safe haven in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, this raises a bunch of thorny questions.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to resist the urge to go and trample a bunch of civil liberties here, but there are steps that we believe we can work through with the technology companies to take some common-sense measures that would enhance public safety.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And the other new thing was where he talked about the responsibility of the Muslim community to confront this ideology, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout excuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 This was the sharpest language he\xe2\x80\x99s used to date about Muslims\xe2\x80\x99 own responsibility to counter this ideology.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like -- have you been getting a lot of excuses from the Muslim community about why they\xe2\x80\x99re not doing this?\xc2\xa0 And what exactly do you want to see coming from the Muslim community in terms of countering this ideology?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would concede, Mara, that this is probably the -- it probably is the sharpest language that he\xe2\x80\x99s used on this.\xc2\xa0 But the President gave a news conference in Turkey three weeks ago today where he spent quite a bit of time talking about this precise issue.\xc2\xa0 So this is not a new statement on his part. But I would readily acknowledge that this was the most direct way in which it was phrased.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think, frankly, what we would like to see is we would like to see leaders in the Muslim community stand up and speak out more forcefully in terms of condemning these hateful, radicalizing messages that we see from extremist organizations, and to continue to work effectively with law enforcement to protect those members of their community that are most at risk and most vulnerable to being radicalized.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I cited the experience of a couple of pilot projects, where the Department of Justice and one of their community outreach offices has been able to work effectively with leaders in Boston and the Twin Cities and Los Angeles to pursue these kinds of ideas.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some important progress, and there are some best practices that have been learned.\xc2\xa0 And this was the subject of the conversation here at the White House at the Countering Violent Extremism Summit that we hosted here.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a lot more important work to be done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s message that he delivered in his speech last night, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for that to be read in a way that reflects the full message here, both on the responsibility that non-Muslims in the United States have to resist the temptation to stigmatize and to marginalize and to target Muslims, and to recognize the incentive that we have to work with the Muslim community to strengthen all of our communities in this country.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, the President was trying to acknowledge the responsibility that leaders in the Muslim community have to speak out against sort of those hateful and radicalizing messages that extremist organizations are seeking to propagate primarily on social media.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot has gone on since February when the President went to Stanford and had this conversation with the folks there. And now it\xe2\x80\x99s generally conceded we are at war with terrorists.\xc2\xa0 In a time of war, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it time to trample some of those civil liberties perhaps, and for the President now to change his tone about privacy in this particular issue, and to call for, in fact, these chatrooms to be shut down; for the government to have more access to find out who is plotting against the United States and may be incited by these groups overseas?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it -- has the President changed his mindset from when he was expressing concerns about civil liberties in February to now because of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, the President continues to be a strong believer and defender of civil liberties.\xc2\xa0 And his view about the importance of doing that has not changed.\xc2\xa0 I think at the same time, there is clearly additional work that can be done -- technology companies are sort of a good example for all of this\xc2\xa0 -- where we can have a conversation about how we can both ensure strong encryption to protect people\xe2\x80\x99s civil liberties while at the same time making sure that our law enforcement and national security professionals have the tools and access they need to keep us all safe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the same time, the President believes in the free expression of ideas and free speech, but at the same time --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even ideas that incite attacks on this country?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At the same time, it is -- well, look, there are limits on First Amendment rights, right?\xc2\xa0 The famous legal truism about shouting \xe2\x80\x9cfire\xe2\x80\x9d in a crowded theater -- that incitement is certainly something that we want to counter online. And the President was blunt about that.\xc2\xa0 And there is an obvious interest that the technology companies have in countering that incitement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, there is a way for the government and our law enforcement and our homeland security professionals to work effectively with technology companies essentially to do both -- to protect free speech, but at the same time, prevent and counter the efforts of extremist organizations to use social media to incite people to carry out acts of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you say, there are, in fact, limits on free speech, especially during times of war.\xc2\xa0 And while this is not a declared war, certainly the American public believes that we\xe2\x80\x99re at war now with terrorist groups.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s just talk about that for a second. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been at war with al Qaeda since September of 2001.\xc2\xa0 I was asked back in September of 2014 point-blank -- Bill Press is in the back today.\xc2\xa0 Bill, you were the name that popped up on the transcript of the person who asked -- no, I give you credit for this.\xc2\xa0 You asked me directly, September --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we at war with ISIS.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And I said, yes.\xc2\xa0 Where\xe2\x80\x99s the transcript?\xc2\xa0 I said --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What year was this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This was September 22, 2014.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was before that.\xc2\xa0 It was September 12th.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, wow.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Michelle did her homework today.\xc2\xa0 The point is, for more than a year, I have been asked and other senior administration officials have been asked about whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re at war with ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So some of the coverage last night sort of seemed to have forgotten about that, and I was surprised.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the fact is, we are at war, because ISIL has declared war on the United States and the rest of the world.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason that the United States is leading a global coalition of 65 nations to degrade and destroy them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the threat appears now not to only be on the war you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, with the coalition fighting ISIL in Syria and Iraq, but more pointedly now, here in the United States, with homeland terrorists who are being incited on the Internet.\xc2\xa0 And my question -- and I think some of the public\xe2\x80\x99s question -- is why is the President asking the technology companies to do their civic duty instead of coming out and demanding that this stop?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me also say that for years before ISIL ran across the desert in Iraq and established a safe haven inside of Syria, the counterterrorism professionals here in the United States, both in the Obama administration and in the previous one, were active in disrupting plots here in the homeland -- plots that\xe2\x80\x99s were inspired by terrorist organizations overseas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The way that this threat has evolved is that ISIL has proven to be a particularly effective radicalizer and inspirer of violence -- certainly not the first one, but they are the latest iteration of it.\xc2\xa0 And they do have an effective strategy for propagating their hateful ideology in a way that seeks to inspire people to carry out acts of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- the point is, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t new.\xc2\xa0 But it is more serious because we have seen that ISIL is more effective than some other organizations that have attempted to do the same thing.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of that threat.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- again, this is the reason the President ordered military action in Iraq and in Syria in the first place, is to prevent ISIL -- or to kick ISIL out of the safe haven that they\xe2\x80\x99ve established in this part of the world.\xc2\xa0 By having a safe haven, it makes it easier for them to devise these online strategies.\xc2\xa0 And if we can apply additional pressure to them, take out ISIL leaders, we can be effective in countering their ability to spread that ideology online.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me give you one example.\xc2\xa0 Three or four weeks ago, the United States took an airstrike that took out \xe2\x80\x9cJihadi John.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 This was an ISIL leader who had worked hard to cultivate his online personality by appearing in those disgusting, violent execution videos.\xc2\xa0 That certainly is going to be disruptive to their strategy.\xc2\xa0 It can\xe2\x80\x99t be the only element of our strategy, but applying this military pressure that has been underway for more than a year is part and parcel of our effort to counter them online.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to tie it up, just to -- maybe you can understand the criticism, or get -- what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at is, out there, there is a great deal of people who are saying the President is holding meetings, talking with technology companies, and while they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about it this is still going on.\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t something being done?\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t something being announced as this is what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing now, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do this, instead of saying we\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk to technology companies about it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jim, as I tried to describe earlier, there is a specific strategy that we are pursuing to counter all of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to use social media to radicalize people around the world and here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And there are a variety of strategies for doing that.\xc2\xa0 One is to apply intense pressure to them overseas.\xc2\xa0 The second is to shut down their financing efforts -- that will prevent them from being able to fund their ongoing efforts.\xc2\xa0 The third is to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re building a stronger relationship with the Muslim American community here at home, that we can do a better job of figuring out which people are most likely to be vulnerable to radicalizing ideology and to try to get to them before they carry out an act of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also working with the technology companies to deny ISIL or other extremists essentially a safe haven by using encryption.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are working with technology companies to reduce the ability of extremist organizations to use social media to spread their hateful ideology.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just one thing; in fact, it is a comprehensive strategy.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s one that\xe2\x80\x99s going to require vigilance and determination, but it\xe2\x80\x99s one that the President is confident if we continue to implement it effectively, that it will work and we will prevail.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Alexis.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I have a couple quick things.\xc2\xa0 Five weeks ago, the President said that he had authorized up to 50 Special Ops to go into Syria, and, as you know, Secretary Clinton yesterday said that it\xe2\x80\x99s urgent to get them on the ground as soon as possible and assess what\xe2\x80\x99s needed, maybe expand their number.\xc2\xa0 Can you update us on when the President\xe2\x80\x99s Special Ops team that he ordered is expected to be on the ground, and whether he agrees that he can assess then, based on how they\xe2\x80\x99re doing on the ground, to perhaps enlarge their number?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Alexis, I think for obvious operational security reasons, I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about the travel plans of our special operators in Syria.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Secretary seemed to know that they were not on the ground.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to check with the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 If they have the ability to describe to you more about where those forces are operating you can check with them, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to give you much information on that, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on the President\xe2\x80\x99s initiatives on guns, the President has been reviewing executive orders that -- order or power that he might exert.\xc2\xa0 He made no mention of that last night.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the status of the review that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you beyond confirming for you that it is ongoing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And then third -- because I\xe2\x80\x99m striking out here -- (laughter) -- the President also mentioned a summit on extremist financing, December 17th.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what is new about that, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s a Treasury Department initiative, how that will work?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is actually a summit that is going to be convened at the United Nations at the United Nations Security Council.\xc2\xa0 Finance ministers from the countries that are serving on the United Nations Security Council will come together to engage in a discussion about intensifying the international community\xe2\x80\x99s strategy for shutting off ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing.\xc2\xa0 We know that, right now, ISIL benefits significantly from selling oil on the black market and other strategies that allow them to fund their operations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the United Nations that needs to have this discussion.\xc2\xa0 The United States Senate needs to have this discussion.\xc2\xa0 For more than a year, the United States has been waiting on Republicans in the Senate to confirm Adam Szubin to the position at the Treasury Department to fill the office that\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for leading the U.S. government\xe2\x80\x99s work in this area. Mr. Szubin is a financial expert.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s an attorney who served not just President Obama, but also President Bush.\xc2\xa0 There is nobody that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that has quibbled with his credentials or his ability to do the job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is Republican partisan obstruction in the United States Senate that, frankly, makes it harder for us to implement this element of our counter-ISIL strategy.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure how Republicans look themselves in the mirror when they continue to do this.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they can shave in the dark.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is, there is no excuse --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or not shave.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Or not shave.\xc2\xa0 There is no excuse for this.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that Republicans will act to confirm Mr. Szubin as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, Secretary Lew will represent the United States government at that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 So this is a meeting that will be convened at the finance ministers\xe2\x80\x99 level, so Secretary Lew would be -- and even if Mr. Szubin were confirmed, Secretary Lew would be responsible for representing the United States at that particular meeting.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to our ability to work with the international community to shut off ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing, it would certainly aid our efforts to have a confirmed individual in that position.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President won\xe2\x80\x99t attend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He will not.\xc2\xa0 This is a finance-level -- finance ministers-level meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about Secretary Kerry?\xc2\xa0 Will he be there, as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is a finance ministers\xe2\x80\x99 meeting, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe Secretary Kerry will be there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have an update or reaction to the apparent killing of the ISIS leader in Libya?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 This is something that was confirmed by the Department of Defense just today.\xc2\xa0 I believe it was two or three weeks ago that the Department of Defense announced that they were carrying out this action against the top ISIL official in Libya.\xc2\xa0 And the Department of Defense did confirm today that they had taken this individual off the battlefield.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would also note that the Department of Defense also confirmed today that a U.S. military airstrike in Somalia resulted in the death of Abdirahman Sandhere.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also known as \xe2\x80\x9cUkash.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 This is a senior leader of al Qaeda -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, a senior leader of the al Qaeda-affiliated group, al-Shabaab in Somalia.\xc2\xa0 And I think this is testament to the ongoing efforts of the administration and the Department of Defense to apply significant pressure to extremist organizations around the world who are seeking to do harm to the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Lindsey Graham this morning said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nobody left in Syria to train.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The people that we\xe2\x80\x99re training are Kurds, the YPG.\xc2\xa0 He says they have no ability or desire to go into Raqqa, for example, and take down the caliphate, or to take it away from ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Where does he have that wrong?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have found, Kevin, is that in some place in northern -- primarily in northern and northeastern Syria, we have been able to coordinate with a variety of groups in that region who have been effective in driving out ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about this statistic that ISIL is no longer able to operate in about 20 to 25 percent of the area that they previously controlled.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of the success that we have had in pushing back ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tCertainly, the Kurds have been effective partners with our coalition.\xc2\xa0 But there have also been Turkmen fighters; there have also been some Arab fighters in that region of the world -- or that region of Syria that have been effective in fighting ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to support all of those groups in that effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that ISIL, or ISIS, will be destroyed while he is in office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has been clear from the very beginning that this is a longer-term proposition.\xc2\xa0 And I would not envision a scenario where the United States has completed the mission of destroying ISIL in the next 13 months.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly would expect that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make progress in degrading that organization by taking out its leaders, by further restricting its financing, by taking out its infrastructure, and by taking more territory that they -- continuing the progress of taking back territory that they\xe2\x80\x99d previously controlled.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a couple more.\xc2\xa0 You said -- or the President said last night that special operators would obviously continue to go in and do the work of the United States.\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied with the equipping of Syrians and Iraqis to take the fight to ISIL?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, part of our strategy has been to equip fighters on the ground both in Iraq and in Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is that going?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously those are two different situations.\xc2\xa0 Inside of Iraq we have a central government with whom we can work, and there are Iraqi forces that have been mobilized by the central government that are operating under the command and control of the central government that are receiving some equipment from the central government there and that can be augmented by contributions from the United States and our coalition partners.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, there are a number of other countries, aside from the United States, that are engaged in training efforts there.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s just one example of how other coalition partners are assisting that effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Syria, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit different because there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously no central government with whom we can coordinate.\xc2\xa0 So these are groups of fighters that are less well-organized.\xc2\xa0 They have less support.\xc2\xa0 They have less access to formal training.\xc2\xa0 They have less access to equipment.\xc2\xa0 And so they need greater assistance.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why, frankly, the challenge in Syria is even greater than the significant challenge that we face inside of Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we could expect less progress in Syria, given the parameters on the ground?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m hesitant to make that kind of prediction.\xc2\xa0 I think that the challenges that we face in Syria are different and more significant just because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a central government with whom we can closely coordinate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Abadi government, to their credit, even in the face of some very difficult circumstances, has worked to try to govern that country in a multi-sectarian way and to unite that country to counter the threat from ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We have seen no indication that the Assad regime is prepared to do that, and so that makes it a little bit more difficult as we try to mobilize and support a fighting force on the ground inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it realistic to expect the Turkey-Syria border to be sealed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It certainly is doable.\xc2\xa0 It will require a commitment on the part of the Turks to do it.\xc2\xa0 We have seen, because of the investment that the Turks have made in other sections of their previously contested border, that they have been able to secure significant portions of their more than 500-mile-long border with Syria.\xc2\xa0 But there continues to be this corridor, this 98-kilometors-wide corridor along their border that remains unsecure.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a problem because through that corridor flows oil on the black market.\xc2\xa0 We know that there are foreign fighters moving back and forth through that corridor.\xc2\xa0 There are other items that are being bought and sold along that corridor.\xc2\xa0 And shutting down ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing is an important part of our effort to degrade and ultimately destroy them.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is more that we would like to see the Turks do to secure that border.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Turks already act effectively to shut down large portions of their border.\xc2\xa0 We just need them to finish the job.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about the ongoing negotiations, looking for a ceasefire or some sort of a transition of power in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Where are we on that?\xc2\xa0 Would the President like to see that process, especially here, over the next several weeks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, as you know, there is this January 1st deadline where we hope we would be able to at least get a ceasefire in some parts of the country and begin to have the kinds of talks that would lead to an eventual political process in that country.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that there have been any meetings on this in the last couple of weeks, but there certainly is potential for a meeting in the next couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that Secretary Kerry and his team continue to work on every single day.\xc2\xa0 Even if there aren\xe2\x80\x99t formal meetings, I know that Secretary Kerry is in touch with his counterparts around the world on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFor a more detailed update, I\xe2\x80\x99d check with the State Department.\xc2\xa0 They may have some more details for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tJordan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Just before you came out, Michael McCaul, the Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said that intelligence officials have determined that Islamist extremists in Syria have explored using the refugee program to enter the United States.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not something that the administration has said publicly.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can confirm whether that\xe2\x80\x99s true, or was Chairman McCaul off base?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I am not able to confirm that piece of information, so I guess I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to Mr. McCaul\xe2\x80\x99s office to explain where he got that information.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI do think it does, however, give me the opportunity to remind all of you that those individuals that seek to enter the United States through the refugee resettlement program do so only after undergoing the most intensive screening of anybody who attempts to enter the United States, to say nothing of the screening that takes place by the United Nations to determine whether or not these individuals should be included in the program in the first place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo once they are determined by the U.N. to be eligible for this program, these individuals, if they are referred to the United States, are, while they are outside of our borders, interviewed by national security professionals, biographic and biometric information about them is collected.\xc2\xa0 It is then run through a variety of databases maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center, by the Department of Defense, by Interpol, by other elements of our intelligence community, and then only then, a process that typically takes upwards of two years, are those individuals allowed to enter the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Francesca.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple on the topic du jour, Josh.\xc2\xa0 We talked about the radical Islamic terrorism thing, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to beat a dead horse here, so to speak, but one Republican yesterday specifically came up with what I\xe2\x80\x99d call a new line of attack on that, comparing it to Pearl Harbor, as today is the anniversary, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if you\xe2\x80\x99re familiar with the comment I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to specifically.\xc2\xa0 Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go ahead and read it for you.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cCould you imagine FDR going before Congress and saying we were attacked yesterday on Pearl Harbor, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about who did it, but you know, we just want to say that they were terrible people and they were thugs.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And so I was wondering what your reaction was to that, and do you think that that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair comparison?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do not.\xc2\xa0 And I think to make comparisons like that only serves to inflate ISIL and to buy into their fantasy that somehow they\xe2\x80\x99re leading a war against the West on behalf of Islam.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a fantasy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a dangerous organization that the United States and the other 65 members of our coalition have mobilized to counter. So the President and the leaders of countries around the world certainly takes this threat seriously.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s also important for us to recognize it for what it is.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has taken the approach that he has.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And next on that, you mentioned earlier in the briefing that some of the Republican presidential candidates who are getting a little heated with their rhetoric, it may be because they are running for President.\xc2\xa0 But they would put it back on the White House and say that last night the President was partisan in what he had to say about guns and some of those other issues.\xc2\xa0 And do you think that that\xe2\x80\x99s fair?\xc2\xa0 Do you think specifically as pertains to guns that the President has sort of I guess contributed to that strife with the Republicans in Congress and running for President by bringing up topics like gun control during a speech that\xe2\x80\x99s a national address to the nation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Francesca, I would note that there are at least a couple of Republicans that agree with the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, that if the government has determined that it is too dangerous for you to board an airplane that you should not be able to buy a gun.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is partisan.\xc2\xa0 We wish there were more Republicans who were willing to speak up and show some political courage in that measure.\xc2\xa0 But again, the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring it up because of his interest in politics; the President brought it up because of his interest in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it does pose a threat to our national security to continue to allow extremists to exploit the easy access to guns in this country, particularly when you consider that, as I just mentioned, individuals who are on the no-fly list are not prevented from purchasing a gun -- at least the way the law is written on the books -- that there are also significant loopholes in the background check process that allows individuals to go to a gun show or even purchase a firearm over the Internet without undergoing a background check.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat has led to too much innocent loss of life, this easy access to guns.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President is concerned about, again, not because of politics, but because of the impact that it has on our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think that they were mostly referring to the assault weapons -- not as much the no-fly list.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And there are some Republicans that support reinstating the assault weapons ban.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but the last thing -- last night, the President stood before a lectern in front of the Resolute Desk to give his address, and that was a bit unusual only in the sense that it\xe2\x80\x99s rarely done that way.\xc2\xa0 Typically, the President sits behind the Resolute Desk instead of standing at a lectern before -- I did my homework on this a little bit.\xc2\xa0 And I was wondering if there was a specific reason that he approached the speech last night that way.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, in doing your homework, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw the pictures of President Bush standing before a podium in the Oval Office when he made a few announcements in there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think in general what we have found is we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached the same conclusion that many of your colleagues in the television industry have found, which is when they go to the South Lawn, they call it a \xe2\x80\x9cstand-up\xe2\x80\x9d for a reason.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Toluse, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On guns, a couple different questions.\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Court today refused to take up a challenge to a local government\xe2\x80\x99s law basically banning assault weapons.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House has a response to that decision and whether or not the President may be more willing to look at cities as places where he could get his proposal for banning assault weapons since it\xe2\x80\x99s not seeming to move forward in Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a reaction to the specific decision by the Supreme Court in that regard.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to other jurisdictions of government, either state or local authorities taking steps to prevent those who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get their hands on guns from getting one, we obviously have seen a number of local jurisdictions take those steps with the goal of trying to make their communities safer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think what many people have concluded is that broader legislation is required; that it\xe2\x80\x99s too easy to move guns across those local jurisdictions; that when a large city, even Chicago, for example, puts in place measures that are pretty effective in keeping guns out of the hands of those who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have them, that it\xe2\x80\x99s too easy for those individuals -- criminals or those who are the subject of a restraining order -- to just drive out to the suburbs, to drive across the county line, and purchase a gun and bring it back into the city.\xc2\xa0 That only underscores the need for broader legislation that would keep our communities -- at least make our communities safer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- legislation include an assault weapons ban and a federal one sort of reviving that?\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President would push for?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of reviving it.\xc2\xa0 The President has long supported reinstating the assault weapons ban.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- make a case for bringing that back up in the national discussion?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President continues to believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 I believe the President mentioned it in a recent interview.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I also have a question sort of about the gun industry.\xc2\xa0 I think today, Smith &amp; Wesson saw their stock reach an eight-year high.\xc2\xa0 The day after Black Friday was one of the biggest days for gun sales.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if all this discussion is sort of having a negative effect in the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind, that he\xe2\x80\x99s bringing up this discussion and not getting any action in Congress, but when it comes to sort of the dollars and cents of it, the gun industry is doing probably the best that it has in a very long time -- whenever we see shootings, whenever we see the President make statements about gun control.\xc2\xa0 Is there a frustration on the President\xe2\x80\x99s part?\xc2\xa0 Is there sort of an assessment about whether or not this is the right strategy?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess if I can harken back to high school English, I guess this is the definition of tragic irony.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the same statistics that you just cited, and I do think it underscores the need for Congress to finally take some common-sense steps, again, that don\xe2\x80\x99t undermine the protected, constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans, but do make it a little harder for criminals, for people who are suspected of having links to terrorism, for people with mental problems from being able to purchase a gun.\xc2\xa0 And congressional action in this regard is the most powerful antidote to that problem and also long overdue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03:17 P.M.
