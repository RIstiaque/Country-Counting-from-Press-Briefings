Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>**Please see below for a correction marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>1:10 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Hope you all enjoyed your weekend.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you on this Monday afternoon.</p>\n<p>We are starting pretty close to on time today, which is a nice, new trend, hopefully that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to continue.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is I have alongside with me here today the President\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy National Security Advisor, Tony Blinken, who is going to talk to you about a telephone call that the President convened with some of our allies in Europe today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I know that over the last couple of weeks you guys have had a lot of questions about what the President is doing in terms of leading the international community\xe2\x80\x99s response to the downing of the Malaysian Airlines jetliner a couple of weeks ago now.\xc2\xa0 There have also been, obviously, a series of coordinated efforts to increase international pressure on Russia for the actions that they have taken in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>So Tony is here to give you a detailed readout of that telephone conversation that the President convened today and answer any questions you may have about our ongoing efforts to coordinate the imposition of economic costs on the Russian regime.\xc2\xa0 He probably only has 10 or 15 minutes here, so we\'ll go through that part of it relatively quickly and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll be around to answer remaining questions you may have.</p>\n<p>But I would encourage you, as you\'re thinking about the questions you want to ask Tony, to focus on the Russia and Ukraine situation.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are a lot of newsy developments in Gaza as well, so he can take one or two of those before departing.\xc2\xa0 But we have to limit this to 10 or 15 minutes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So with that, I present Tony Blinken.</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Josh, thank you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Let me start by giving you a readout of the President\xe2\x80\x99s videoconference with Prime Minister Cameron of the United Kingdom, President Hollande of France, Chancellor Merkel of Germany, and Prime Minister Renzi of Italy.\xc2\xa0 I should add that Chancellor Merkel was actually on the phone; the others were on a videoconference.</p>\n<p>The primary focus of the conversation today was to talk about Ukraine, and they discussed next steps concerning the crisis there, but also efforts to achieve a cease-fire in Gaza, and the situations in Iraq and Libya.</p>\n<p>On Ukraine, they stressed the continued need for unrestricted access to the shoot-down site of Malaysia Air Flight 17 to allow for the recovery of the victims\xe2\x80\x99 remains and for international investigators to proceed with their efforts.\xc2\xa0 They agreed on the importance of coordinated sanctions measures on Russia for its continued transfer of arms, equipment and fighters into eastern Ukraine, including since the crash, and to press Russia to end its efforts to destabilize the country and instead choose a diplomatic path for resolving the crisis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Concerning Gaza, the President noted that Israel has the right to take action to defend itself.\xc2\xa0 The leaders agreed on the need for an immediate, unconditional humanitarian cease-fire, noting shared concern about the risk of further escalation and the loss of more innocent life.</p>\n<p>On Iraq, they discussed the security challenges, welcomed developments in the political process, and urged the swift completion of government coordination and hopefully an inclusive government that results from that.</p>\n<p>And then, with respect to Libya, they agreed on the need for an immediate cease-fire among the militias of Tripoli, calling for the seating of the newly elected Council of Representatives, and underscoring support for the U.N. in seeking a resolution to the conflict.\xc2\xa0 They condemned any use of violence to attack civilians, intimidate officials, or disrupt the political process.</p>\n<p>Having said that, let me just spend a few minutes if I can on Ukraine to put this in context.\xc2\xa0 This was, I think by our count, about the 50th call or videoconference the President has had with his European counterparts since the beginning of this crisis.\xc2\xa0 And ever since Russia\xe2\x80\x99s illegal annexation of Crimea and its campaign to destabilize Ukraine, the President has led the international effort to isolate Russia for its actions in Ukraine, to support Ukraine itself, and to reassure our allies.</p>\n<p>This effort has produced major strategic gains.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve created space for Ukraine to hold successful presidential elections despite Russian efforts to disrupt them.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s produced the strongest leadership Ukraine has seen since the end of the Cold War.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve created space for Ukraine to sign an association agreement with the European Union despite Russian efforts to prevent that.\xc2\xa0 And recall that the former President Yanukovich\xe2\x80\x99s last-minute about-face on signing that association agreement is exactly what precipitated this crisis in the first place.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve forged a robust financial support package for Ukraine led by the IMF.</p>\n<p>None of these things just happened.\xc2\xa0 They were the result of a major, sustained effort by the President to lead the international community.</p>\n<p>All of that said, the challenge to Ukraine remains acute.\xc2\xa0 Ukrainian forces are right now making major gains to regain sovereignty in the east, but at the same time, Russia is doubling down on its own efforts to support the separatists and destabilize the country.\xc2\xa0 Indeed, it is cynically using all of the attention focused on the crash of MH17 as a cover and distraction for its own efforts.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s increased the provision of heavy weaponry across the border.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen convoys of tanks, multiple rocket launchers, artillery and armored vehicles.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s evidence it\xe2\x80\x99s preparing to deliver even more powerful multiple rocket launchers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is firing from positions inside of Russia into Ukraine -- something that we documented this weekend.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a significant re-buildup of Russian forces along the border, potentially positioning Russia for a so-called humanitarian or peacekeeping intervention in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s urgency to arresting these developments, to ending the efforts to destabilize Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And the urgency is this:\xc2\xa0 First, everything we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is a real drag on the Ukrainian economy.\xc2\xa0 The military expenditures that Ukraine has to make are a drag, and the fact that Luhansk and Donetsk, which represent 15 percent of Ukrainian GDP and about 25 percent of its manufacturing exports, are basically taken out of the Ukrainian economy equation is also a drag on the economy.</p>\n<p>Second, the longer this goes on there\xe2\x80\x99s the risk of further outrageous actions by the separatists or by Russia that deepen the international crisis.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a need to take further action now to convince Russia to change course and cease its efforts to destabilize Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the call, the European leaders clearly shared this assessment and a determination to act.\xc2\xa0 We expect the European Union to take significant additional steps this week, including in key sectors of the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 In turn, and in full coordination with Europe, the United States will implement additional measures itself.</p>\n<p>Our purpose here, again, is not to punish Russia, but to make clear that it must cease its support for the separatists and stop destabilizing Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Let me just finish by putting this in a larger context.\xc2\xa0 Everything we\'ve seen as a result of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions and the actions that the President has led in the international community over these many months has turned what is happening in Ukraine into a strategic loser for Russia.\xc2\xa0 First, we\'ve seen a dramatic impact on the Russian economy by the sanctions that the United States, Europeans and others have taken.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are acknowledged by the Russian Finance Minister and, indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister, even Putin himself.\xc2\xa0 Sberbank, the largest bank in Russia and a proxy for the larger economy, a month ago, in announcing a steep decline in profits, said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn particular, recent events in Ukraine significantly impacted the dynamics of the Russian economy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>We\'ve seen the financial markets go up and down, the ruble hitting lows, the Central Bank has had to spend $37 billion to defend the ruble, about 8 percent of its foreign exchange holdings.\xc2\xa0 The result is higher borrowing costs and a decrease in the value of Russian savings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Capital flight -- $70 billion in the first half of this year, more than all of 2013 combined.\xc2\xa0 And projections for the entire year put it at between $100 billion and $200 billion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Foreign investment is drying up.\xc2\xa0 Investors are looking for stability; they\xe2\x80\x99re looking at countries that keep their international commitments; they\xe2\x80\x99re looking at countries that have connected to the international economy.\xc2\xa0 On all three counts, Russia is giving them great pause.\xc2\xa0 The credit rating for Russia was cut to just above the junk level; financing yields are frozen; Russian companies are not issuing bonds to raise capital. And as we\'ve seen overall, Russia is heading for economic contraction, not growth, a significant reversal from just a few months ago.</p>\n<p>Let me add as well, there\xe2\x80\x99s talk that Russia has \xe2\x80\x9cwon Crimea.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is what\xe2\x80\x99s happened is it\'s lost Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Ukraine is more united in a Western orientation than ever before and has a much greater sense of national identity.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve produced, as I mentioned before, the space for elections and the signing of the association agreement with the European Union.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Crimea itself is becoming a dead weight on the Russian economy -- $7 billion a year at least in budget and pension support; $50 to $60 billion required over the next several years for critical infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 And Russians themselves are asking why this money is being spent in Crimea and not in Russia.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s downward pressure on defense spending; there\xe2\x80\x99s downward pressure on discretionary spending as a result of this.</p>\n<p>We\'ve seen the actions in Ukraine reenergize NATO.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a deeper commitment to Article 5.\xc2\xa0 NATO itself, it now has a virtual regular presence, a continuous air, land and sea presence on the territory adjacent to Russia.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll see what happens at the NATO summit, but there\xe2\x80\x99s at least the prospect now for reversing the downward trend in defense spending.</p>\n<p>We\'ve seen on energy reform a jolt to the Europeans to take real steps to decrease dependence, to diversify supply, to upgrade infrastructure, to develop new sources.</p>\n<p>And then, finally, I would say this:\xc2\xa0 For the Russians and for President Putin, power equals a combination of geopolitical influence and economic strength to provide for the Russian people.\xc2\xa0 There was a recent survey in Russia -- the top two priorities of the Russian people were evenly split:\xc2\xa0 international influence and creating the conditions for individual prosperity.\xc2\xa0 As a result of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions in Ukraine and as a result of the leadership we\'ve exerted, both of those are in jeopardy.\xc2\xa0 And so is President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s compact with his own people.</p>\n<p>There is a way out:\xc2\xa0 Integrate Russia with the international economy, diversify away from fossil fuels, and play by the rules. That is still on offer.\xc2\xa0 That is still a possibility.\xc2\xa0 We would like nothing better than to resolve this crisis in Ukraine diplomatically.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s now up to President Putin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much for this update.\xc2\xa0 Could you also update us on the U.S. response to the criticism that Senator Kerry has come under in Israel after his attempts to implement a cease-fire there?\xc2\xa0 Is that damaging to the U.S.-Israel relationship?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Let me say this about Secretary Kerry:\xc2\xa0 Israel has no better friend, no stronger defender.\xc2\xa0 No one has done more to help Israel achieve a secure and lasting peace.\xc2\xa0 He has been tireless in his efforts.\xc2\xa0 And I think that Israel and many countries and friends around the world recognizes exactly that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President raised this in his call with the Prime Minister yesterday?\xc2\xa0 Or have U.S. officials been complaining about the criticism to counterparts in Israel?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Look, what you see, I think, unfortunately on a regular basis, are people leaking things that are either misinformed or attempting to misinform.\xc2\xa0 And in particular, with regard to criticism that was levied by undisclosed sources about the proposal for a cease-fire, the proposal that was criticized was not a U.S. proposal, it was a draft to illicit comments from the Israelis.\xc2\xa0 It was basically a discussion paper based on the original Egyptian initiative.\xc2\xa0 Virtually every element that unidentified sources complained about was in the initial Egyptian proposal and agreed to by Israel 10 days before.</p>\n<p>In that, there was no mention of the need for disarmament. The document underscored the need for discussion between Israel and Palestinian factions.\xc2\xa0 It called for the opening of border crossings.\xc2\xa0 It did not make mention of tunnels.\xc2\xa0 All of this, again, in the Egyptian proposal that the Israelis had accepted and unfortunately Hamas did not.\xc2\xa0 The document also reflected the strong view that we have that demilitarization as well as reconstruction in Gaza are critical agenda items for any negotiations that follow a cease-fire.</p>\n<p>So the bottom line on this is that what was leaked, unfortunately, was I think an effort to misinform or was just misinformed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The sanctions that we\'ve seen so far have been fairly targeted against Russia.\xc2\xa0 Would you describe the sweeping nature of what you\'re talking about later this week being coordinated between Europe and the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get ahead of where the Europeans are or where we are, and we\'ll see that in the days to come.\xc2\xa0 But what we know is this:\xc2\xa0 The Europeans made clear last week that they were prepared to act in key sectors of the Russian economy, including the financial sector, the arms sector, the energy sector.\xc2\xa0 And so I think you can anticipate actions in those areas.\xc2\xa0 Similarly, they\xe2\x80\x99re looking to broaden criteria by which they can sanction people or entities.\xc2\xa0 And I think one of the things they\xe2\x80\x99re looking at is to bring in some of the cronies of President Putin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\'ve already seen with the sanctions to date, as I went through a few moments ago, a very serious impact on the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 And indeed, it\'s the sanctions themselves and then the climate of tremendous uncertainty they create, even with the prospect of more sanctions, that has led to capital flight, investment drying up and the growth projections going down to basically zero.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you talk about this force that\'s building up\xc2\xa0 -- the Russians are building up, are they preparing a Russian invasion of Ukraine?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 One of the things that we believe Russia has been trying to do is, for example, to get the Ukrainians to take some action that they can then use as \xe2\x80\x9cjustification\xe2\x80\x9d for some kind of intervention -- so-called humanitarian intervention, or so-called peacekeeping intervention.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s one of the things that we think is in the potential Russian playbook.</p>\n<p>The other thing they\xe2\x80\x99re doing, most significantly, is increasing the supply of heavy equipment, weapons and fighters to the separatists across the border.\xc2\xa0 And this is well documented in what we\'ve seen; it\'s well documented in social media.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In talking about that buildup and the heavier artillery, are we talking about more surface-to-air missile capability?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 We are talking about multi-rocket launchers -- that\'s one of the things we\'re seeing -- artillery pieces, tanks, armored vehicles, and the concerns, as I said at the outset, about increasingly heavy weaponry.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason for this, and the reason is that on the battlefield itself the Ukrainians are doing very well against the separatists in trying to regain the sovereignty of their entire country.\xc2\xa0 So Russia\xe2\x80\x99s proxies are right now on the losing end of the fight.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we think Russia is doubling down.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think there are still Buk missile launchers within Ukraine at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 We believe that there are SA-11s that are still within Ukraine, including potentially in separatists\xe2\x80\x99 hands.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A two-parter.\xc2\xa0 How did you arrive at $37 billion spent to defend the ruble?\xc2\xa0 And second, are there any other security things you\'re looking at besides rocket launchers and tanks and heavy equipment?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 I think the $37 billion has actually been fairly well documented in the financial press and by other statements that have been made.\xc2\xa0 We can get you the backup for that.</p>\n<p>And in terms of the military equipment that the Russians are providing, again, those are the main elements, but there are certainly other things that are going in.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of heavy weaponry, those are the critical elements.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about actions that have been taken this week by the EU and U.S.\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to something that Josh said from the podium Friday about Russia and Putin were culpable for the downing of Flight 17.\xc2\xa0 Is there a chance, is there a possibility that Putin could be charged in the International Crimes Court with war crimes, by any chance, with all of this that\'s going on right now?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 When it comes to Russian culpability, I think the record is clear.\xc2\xa0 The Russians have been directly supporting the separatists with the provision of weapons.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the SA-11 that was used to shoot down the Malaysian airliner came from Russia.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t know who was operating it.\xc2\xa0 We believe the weapon itself came from Russia.\xc2\xa0 The three top leading separatist leaders are all Russian nationals.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s clear that Russia has a significant influence over the separatists and could, if it so desired, get them to cease and desist.</p>\n<p>So, in that sense, there is a clear and ongoing culpability by Russia for events in eastern Ukraine and for a failure to de-escalate the situation, and indeed, for the context in which all of this is happening, including the shoot-down of the airliner.</p>\n<p>In terms of pointing to exactly who pulled the trigger, that we don\'t know yet and we\'ll see if we can develop that information.\xc2\xa0 But the bottom line is this:\xc2\xa0 Through its ongoing support and increasing support for the separatists, Russia bears responsibility for everything that\'s going on in eastern Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying technically he could be brought before the International Crimes Court?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t want to get ahead of anything.\xc2\xa0 Again, the main point is to emphasize that Russia bears responsibility and has the ability to actually de-escalate this crisis by moving it onto a diplomatic track.\xc2\xa0 That is what we\xe2\x80\x99d most like to see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of reports that just came now that Gaza Central Hospital has been hit, and 10 more dead Palestinian children.\xc2\xa0 You said that the United States is Israel\xe2\x80\x99s best friend, which I tend to agree with you.\xc2\xa0 You also provide them with $3 billion a year, and you give them the Iron Dome that saved countless lives.\xc2\xa0 How come you don\'t have any leverage over Israel to extract a humanitarian cease-fire that would last for seven days?\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that you basically have no influence over them, or that just Israel doesn\'t care?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 First, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those specific reports. Second, the record is clear:\xc2\xa0 Israel has repeatedly accepted cease-fires that Hamas has rejected.\xc2\xa0 So the bottom line on that is clear.</p>\n<p>Let me say more generally, no country can abide rockets raining down on its people or terrorists tunneling underground to kill or kidnap its people.\xc2\xa0 We have consistently and repeatedly defended Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to defend itself.\xc2\xa0 Hamas intentionally targets civilians.\xc2\xa0 And indeed, Iron Dome, thankfully, is there and has protected many of those civilians.\xc2\xa0 And it uses the Palestinian people as human shields, wrapping them around its weapons and strategic sites.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In contrast, Israeli policy is to avoid civilian casualties. Indeed, it holds itself to the highest standards to take every precaution to avoid those casualties.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is, despite its efforts, the civilian suffering in Gaza is great and growing every day.\xc2\xa0 So the practical reality is that it is difficult for Israel to meet its own high standards.\xc2\xa0 Civilian casualties are increasing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s especially heartbreaking to see children suffering in this crisis.</p>\n<p>This is a problem we have grappled with in Iraq and then in Afghanistan because we, too, hold ourselves to these standards.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly difficult to sustain them.\xc2\xa0 But I think this underscores the urgency of getting an unconditional, immediate, humanitarian cease-fire.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- said yesterday -- just a quick a follow-up -- that he wants Gaza demilitarized.\xc2\xa0 What does that mean in terms of a long-term strategy or a peace negotiation or now as we talk in the next week or so?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 As I said, we support an immediate, unconditional, humanitarian pause leading, we hope, to a sustainable cease-fire.\xc2\xa0 We also believe that any process to resolve the crisis in Gaza in a lasting and meaningful way must also lead to the disarmament of terrorist groups.\xc2\xa0 And what we intend to do is to work closely with Israel, regional partners and the international community to achieve this goal.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ann, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll let Tony go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 On Russia, if all the impact of all of these sanctions and all the threat of sanctions are as dire as you\xe2\x80\x99ve described, why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Putin blinked?</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 He has to make a strategic decision.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re exactly right, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made it yet.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him on a regular basis pull back tactically, say the right things in public while he\xe2\x80\x99s doing the wrong things behind the scenes.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s clearly sensitive to the pressure that\'s being exerted.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s precisely because we\xe2\x80\x99ve not yet seen a strategic turn from Putin that we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely essential to take additional measures.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the Europeans and the United States intend to do this week.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Tony.</p>\n<p>MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Tony.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right before we move on to other topics, I do want to do one thing at the top.\xc2\xa0 And I believe we have a slide that goes along with this -- there it is.\xc2\xa0 Today we got some very good news about Medicare\xe2\x80\x99s financial future.\xc2\xa0 In the President\xe2\x80\x99s first year in office in 2009, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security trustees projected the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would not be able to pay its bills in 2017, just three years from now.\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s new date is 2030 -- 13 years later than that projection in 2009, an improvement that is thanks in part to the reforms of the Affordable Care Act, such as efforts to reduce hospital spending on preventable readmissions.\xc2\xa0 And today\xe2\x80\x99s date, you\xe2\x80\x99ll note, is actually even four years later than was projected just last year.</p>\n<p>A couple other relevant statistics that are included in the report:\xc2\xa0 Furthermore, per-capita growth, or the amount spent per Medicare beneficiary has slowed dramatically in recent years, falling to one-third of what it was, and to nearly zero last year -- helping to restrain overall growth in Medicare spending even as millions of baby boomers enter the program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In addition, the trustees project that the Medicare Part B premium will not increase, which would make 2015 the second year in a row that premiums in Medicare stay flat.</p>\n<p>While today\xe2\x80\x99s report focuses on Medicare, it reflects broader trends in the health care system toward much slower growth in costs, a trend that has continued into 2014.\xc2\xa0 Over the 50 months since enactment of the Affordable Care Act, health care prices have risen at a slower rate than over any comparable period in 50 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that is a report that is being released as we speak, and so there will obviously be some more details included in that report later today when you get a chance to review it.</p>\n<p>So with that, Nedra, do you have any additional questions today?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us your response to the VA deal?\xc2\xa0 Does the President think it does enough to solve the problem with the health care system?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Nedra, this compromise has been announced between House Republicans and the chair of the Senate Veterans Committee.\xc2\xa0 We certainly welcome that announcement.\xc2\xa0 There are a couple of reasons based on published reports that we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by that compromise.</p>\n<p>The first is, as you even heard me mention on Friday, there are much-needed reforms that need to be implemented into the Veterans Administration.\xc2\xa0 The President and others have called for those important management reforms to be implemented, and again, based on press reports, the indications of those reforms are that many of them are included in this bill.</p>\n<p>The second thing -- and this is really important -- on July 16th, Acting Secretary Sloan Gibson called for Congress to provide VA the additional resources necessary to deliver timely, high-quality care to veterans through a strengthened VA system while also temporarily using care in the community to help ensure veterans can get the care they need when they need it.</p>\n<p>When he asked for those additional resources to address some very specific concerns that he had laid out, that was something that had previously not been part of the debate as it relates to this VA reform package.\xc2\xa0 So the inclusion of these additional resources at the strong urging of the Acting Secretary is a positive step in the right direction, and something that we think will be very important to the success of some of the reforms that are contemplated by this bill.</p>\n<p>In addition, this proposal for on a temporary, as-needed basis to allow some veterans to get some access to care in the community is also the kind of thing that could address the immediate need that many veterans have, but by adding these additional resources over the long term, we feel like those are benefits and care that can be provided through the VA.</p>\n<p>So the details of this compromise have yet to be unveiled, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the announcement that is planned for Capitol Hill later today.\xc2\xa0 But the early reports are positive.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, Susan Rice was on MSNBC a while ago.\xc2\xa0 She talked about a grave and deepening concern at the civilian casualties in Gaza.\xc2\xa0 What exactly would you like the Israelis to do?\xc2\xa0 Are you calling on them to call off the offensive?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Steve, we have said many times -- I think Tony just had the opportunity to say that we defend Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to defend themselves.\xc2\xa0 In fact, you could make a case, and many Israeli political leaders do, that they have a responsibility to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking steps militarily to account for the safety of civilians on the Israeli side of the border.\xc2\xa0 This is, after all, the Israeli population that elected them, and they are in the best position to determine what steps are necessary to protect their citizens.\xc2\xa0 That is their right.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Israel leaders often say that they have in place very high standards to ensure the safety and well-being of civilians on the other side of the border, as well.\xc2\xa0 That stands in stark contrast to the strategy that is deployed by Hamas and other extremist groups in Gaza that are intentionally targeting civilians on the other side of the border.\xc2\xa0 They are also intentionally using civilians on their side of the border to try to essentially shield their equipment and their personnel from Israeli military activities.\xc2\xa0 So there is a stark contrast in the approach that\xe2\x80\x99s taken by the Israelis and taken by Hamas and other extremist groups.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That said, as I mentioned, Israel and their political leaders often talk about the high standards that they put in place for their military operations to ensure the safety and well-being of civilians -- innocent civilians on the Palestinian side of the border.\xc2\xa0 Based on published reports, it\xe2\x80\x99s apparent that there is more that they should do to live up to those standards that they have set.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that we routinely encourage them to do, while defending their right to defend themselves.\xc2\xa0 The President reiterated that in his phone call with Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about increasing sanctions against Russia, and sort of the ultimate would be these sweeping sectoral sanctions.\xc2\xa0 So can you explain why that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened now?\xc2\xa0 Why is this not the time to go that far, and still do these kind of slow, incremental building sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would say that the sanctions regime that the President rolled out about a week and a half ago, the day before the downing of the Malaysian Airlines jetliner, did take a step in that very direction.\xc2\xa0 These were sectoral sanctions that were aimed at specific entities in the defense, financial and energy sectors.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There was an indication from our European partners that they were taking the preliminary steps necessary to implement similar sanctions in their own right, but those steps have not yet been taken by the Europeans.\xc2\xa0 That is something that was discussed by the President and his counterparts in Western Europe earlier today, as Tony mentioned.</p>\n<p>So there have been some steps that the United States has taken to put in place and impose economic costs against President Putin and the Russian regime.\xc2\xa0 Tony detailed the economic impact that those sanctions were having.\xc2\xa0 But as Ann rightly pointed out in her question, it is true that the costs have not yet led to the kind of strategic re-evaluation that we would like to see the Russians undertake.\xc2\xa0 That is why the international community is actively considering imposing additional costs by having the Europeans increase the amount of sanctions that they have currently levied.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also why the United States is considering additional steps that we could take that would pose additional economic costs on Russia and on President Putin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, so the question was really -- I mean, we all know that it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of these very precise, let\xe2\x80\x99s pick this bank or that bank; it\xe2\x80\x99s not on the entire Russian banking system.\xc2\xa0 Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s still any leverage left in doing it that way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not an expert in terms of the way that these tools are deployed.\xc2\xa0 But it is our view that there is additional leverage that can be gained.\xc2\xa0 That is certainly why they\xe2\x80\x99re being contemplated both by leaders in Western Europe, but also by those who do have an expertise in this field in this country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As Tony documented, there are a number of economic consequences that Russia has already had to bear in terms of the outflow of private capital, in terms of the downward revisions in their economic projections.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen Russia expend significant sums of money to try to shore up the strength of their own currency.</p>\n<p>So there are a number of steps that Russia has taken, and a number of outside evaluators who have reviewed the situation to confirm our suspicion that the economic costs have taken a toll on the Russian economy but they have not yet led President Putin to re-evaluate his strategy in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And that ultimately is our goal.</p>\n<p>Bob.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a quick follow-up on the VA bill.\xc2\xa0 Is $10 billion enough?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve unveiled it up on the Hill, so is $10 billion enough to take care of the system with its deep, deep troubles right now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re still evaluating the specifics and details of their package, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say any more than I already have.\xc2\xa0 But in the next couple of days, we may be in a position to comment on that a little further.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The House and Senate are very divided on the border supplemental right now.\xc2\xa0 If they can\xe2\x80\x99t come to agreement by the end of the week, what is the practical effect?\xc2\xa0 Can you wait until September?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Cheryl, I would refer you to the individual agencies for the impact that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pass the supplemental appropriations request would have on their ability to perform the functions that they are required to perform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are hopeful that Congress will take the kind of action that is required.\xc2\xa0 Both Democrats and Republicans have spoken quite publicly about their concerns about the situation at the border.\xc2\xa0 This administration has been really clear about what we feel like we need in terms of resources to deal with the influx that we saw of those who were apprehended at the border earlier this summer.</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s a detailed package that we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned last week, the Speaker, at a news conference at the end of the week, said that he was still discussing this matter with members of his own caucus.\xc2\xa0 That was a pretty disappointing development in the part of this administration.\xc2\xa0 We put forward a detailed package -- I happened to bring it with me right here -- it includes very detailed numbers about what we feel is necessary.</p>\n<p>I noticed that the new Republican Whip was on one of the Sunday shows yesterday and noted that the administration was asking for a -- what he described as a blank check.\xc2\xa0 It makes me think he\xe2\x80\x99s not sure -- that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what a blank check is.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve actually been very specific about the numbers that we feel are necessary to deal with this problem and to address the range of concerns that many people have raised about those who have been apprehended at the border.</p>\n<p>So we hope that there will be prompt congressional action on this that is in line with their rhetoric on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure, Wendell, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the change in the 2008 law on non-contiguous migrants\xe2\x80\x99 deportation part of that package?\xc2\xa0 The President had indicated that he supported a change and his advisors say that changing that law would be necessary to send the kids at least from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador back as rapidly as those from Canada and Mexico.\xc2\xa0 So why is that not a part of that package?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you would have to talk to members of Congress about how they want to put this all together.\xc2\xa0 What we believe is most important is ensuring that the federal government has the resources necessary to address the range of challenges that are posed by this situation.\xc2\xa0 Remember, it includes some additional security at the border in the form of surveillance equipment.\xc2\xa0 It also includes the ability of the federal government to open and operate additional detention centers so that we can detain those individuals who have been apprehended at the border.\xc2\xa0 It includes some funding for HHS that would allow them to evaluate the basic health needs of those individuals who have been apprehended, both to meet their humanitarian needs, but also to ensure the safety of the broader communities in which they\'re detained.</p>\n<p>It also includes funding that would allow these repatriation flights to take place so that we could more quickly return those individuals that have been apprehended here to their home countries.\xc2\xa0 It also, of course, includes additional resources to ensure that those who are apprehended at the border receive the due process to which they\'re entitled.\xc2\xa0 So this means hiring new judges and prosecutors and asylum officials to ensure that that can take place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But notwithstanding Democrat and Republican differences over the amount of funding, the Republicans say in order to approve some, they\'re going to need to change that 2008 law.\xc2\xa0 Does the President support that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is unfortunate that you would see them take an absolutist position on this.\xc2\xa0 We certainly do support Congress taking the necessary steps to give the Secretary of Homeland Security the flexibility he needs and the discretion that he can use to more efficiently and effectively enforce the law.\xc2\xa0 That is a priority of this administration.</p>\n<p>But we should not allow the debate around what should be included in that language to hold up something that everybody agrees is necessary, which is additional resources that can be used by the federal government to meet the basic humanitarian needs of those individuals who are apprehended, but also provide funding that can be used to more quickly return those who are found by the courts to not have a legal basis for remaining in the country.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Some members of the Republican Whip team on that have suggested that they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten surprising support for what is a much smaller check than the one that the White House is asking for, and the $2.7 billion being put forth by the Senate is getting some pushback from Democrats like Joe Manchin, Mary Landrieu and doesn\'t seem to have a lot of support on the Republican side.\xc2\xa0 And you also have a situation where Congress is in session for three and a half days this week.\xc2\xa0 So with the clock ticking, what do you see as the prognosis and what happens if none of this goes through?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are those here in town and probably those of you here in this room that have a little bit more experience in evaluating congressional action than I do.\xc2\xa0 So I will leave that analysis and prognostication to the experts.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll simply observe that this administration three weeks ago today put forward a very detailed request before Congress, and asking for those additional resources to address a problem that I think to a person every single member of Congress agreed existed. And what we have seen in Congress is a lot of talk, particularly from Republicans, but not a lot of willingness to act.\xc2\xa0 And that is rather unfortunate.</p>\n<p>And we are hopeful that in the pivotal week that remains before Congress departs Washington for the traditional five-week recess that they\xe2\x80\x99ll take the important steps that are necessary to ensure the federal government has the resources to deal with a problem that, again, I think every single member of Congress agrees exists.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I also ask you about a Reuters\xe2\x80\x99 report that just came out?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any more details than this, that Netanyahu says Israel \xe2\x80\x9cmust be prepared for protracted Gaza campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that there could be a military victory for Israel, but a loss for them in both the political realm and the court of public opinion.\xc2\xa0 Can I get your reaction to that statement by Benjamin Netanyahu?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to react to a statement that occurred while I was standing up here.\xc2\xa0 But let me say that it is the position of the United States that it is in the best interests of people on both sides of the border for a cease-fire to take effect.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is pretty simple, that as long as the violence continues across the border, there are going to be innocent civilians in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0 And having those innocent civilians face that extreme danger has already had terribly tragic consequences for both the Israeli people and the Palestinian people.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we want to see that cease-fire put in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There will be an opportunity once that cease-fire is in place for us to have discussions around the kinds of concerns that have legitimately been raised by the Israelis, in particular about Hamas\xe2\x80\x99 repeated willingness to use tunnels and to fire rockets aimed squarely at doing harm to innocent civilians.</p>\n<p>So it is the priority of this administration for a cease-fire to be put in place.\xc2\xa0 That is why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Secretary Kerry doggedly pursue diplomacy to protect the lives of innocent civilians on both sides of that border.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Moving on --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure, Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the two or three, maybe three or four absolute necessities that the President thinks Congress has to get done by the end of this week?\xc2\xa0 Would he ask them to delay their recess?\xc2\xa0 And would he ever consider skipping Kansas City?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we always say with the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel, his trip to my hometown notwithstanding -- (laughter) -- as is always the case with the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel, if there is a critically important function of the presidency that cannot be performed from the road, the President will not hesitate to change his schedule in order to fulfill those functions.\xc2\xa0 So I do not anticipate that anything that\'s happening in Congress would require that at this point.\xc2\xa0 But if something does emerge, something unexpected does emerge, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that is something that the President would consider.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he ask Congress to delay its break?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let him speak to that.\xc2\xa0 If he decides that that\'s what they should do, then he will say so.\xc2\xa0 At this point it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the leaders in Congress to determine their own schedule.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of important work that needs to get done this week.\xc2\xa0 That includes continuing to follow through on these VA reforms on which an agreement was announced over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 So hopefully that can move forward without any delay or incident.</p>\n<p>We certainly would like to see a step taken in terms of passing the supplemental appropriations request that this administration put forward several weeks ago to ensure that the administration has the resources necessary to deal with the problem at the border.</p>\n<p>That being said, we could certainly address many of the problems at the border if Congress -- if the House were to take action on comprehensive immigration reform legislation that\'s already passed the Senate.\xc2\xa0 The Senate did their work more than a year ago.\xc2\xa0 Just by taking one simple vote, the House of Representatives could approve that legislation.\xc2\xa0 The President would sign it.\xc2\xa0 That would do more to improve our economy, create jobs and reduce the deficit than so many other things that Congress is debating right now.</p>\n<p>I think what is the source of particular disappointment on this end of Pennsylvania Avenue, and I think of people in both parties across the country is to see that Congress -- House Republicans in particular -- are using this very valuable time to debate a piece of legislation that would allow House Republicans to file a taxpayer-funded lawsuit against the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\'t think that rises to the level of a priority that so many of these other things Congress is ignoring right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Leslie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 With Secretary Kerry unable to get a cease-fire during his trip, and the President talking to Prime Minister Netanyahu last night in what sounded like pretty blunt terms -- what are the next steps for the White House?\xc2\xa0 And do you -- to follow up on a previous question, do you believe that there is any leverage left for the United States with Israel?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the United States remains deeply engaged in this effort.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry has been leading that effort over the last week in terms of the dogged diplomacy that he\xe2\x80\x99s been pursuing.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been meeting with his counterparts not just in Israel and among the leaders of the Palestinian people, but also with his counterparts in Egypt and Qatar and Turkey and the Arab League, the U.N.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been deeply engaged in these conversations in pursuit of a multilateral, international effort to try to bring both sides together and reinstate the terms of the 2012 cease-fire, to try to get those civilians who right now are in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way into a safer position.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been the focal point of our efforts, and we remain engaged in it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of our relationship with Israel, the United States remains a strong ally of the nation of Israel.\xc2\xa0 American leaders say that; Israeli leaders say the same thing.\xc2\xa0 The best evidence that I have of that is the assistance that the United States has provided to the Israeli government to construct the Iron Dome system that right now is, thankfully, protecting so many Israeli civilians from these rockets that Hamas is firing.\xc2\xa0 So that relationship remains strong.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the reason that Secretary Kerry remains so committed to this effort is that -- or at least is in part that we believe it is clearly in the interest of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s long-term security for this cease-fire [violence]* to be brought to an end, and for negotiations between the Palestinian leaders and Israeli leaders to get started in terms of trying to eventually down the line reach this broader, two-state solution.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to what Tony was saying about the sanctions and the outlook for them.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- if I understood it correctly, the EU is going to go first with their sanctions and probably -- or possibly this week, is that correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that he was in a position to talk about the sequencing of the announcement.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that he committed to our expectation that we would see Europe act before the end of the week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the U.S. act before the end of the week?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Our position is that the options like that remain on the table, that the United States is prepared to impose additional costs on Russia for their destabilizing activities in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to confirm for you whether any decisions have been made about carrying out that action or what those actions might look like.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked before, it would be a strategically unwise thing to do to talk about the details of those sanctions before they\'re implemented. But I am in a position to confirm that those kinds of options remain on the table when it comes to the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One final -- would the U.S. concentrate on any particular sector?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, if we have additional sanctions to announce, then we will be able to get into those kinds of details.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, it would be preliminary for me to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Goyal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, some people in the Congress want to close down the 84-year-old Export-Import Bank.\xc2\xa0 And many small businesses are saying that it is helping small businesses export U.S. goods abroad and also creating thousands of jobs in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 My question is that some people in the Congress are saying that it is helping only the big companies.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s action -- or reaction about this bank?\xc2\xa0 Next month will expire the --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President does believe that Congress should take steps to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not just the view of this administration and many Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, it\xe2\x80\x99s also the view of organizations like the National Association of Manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce.\xc2\xa0 Those are two organizations that don\'t often agree with the President when it comes to some aspects of American economic policy.</p>\n<p>But that is an area where this administration agrees that the Export-Import Bank plays a positive role in creating jobs and creating opportunities for American businesses to succeed by opening up markets around the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second question -- oh, by the way, it has also created jobs between India and U.S. trade.\xc2\xa0 Second question is that as far as U.S. ambassador to India is concerned, you think U.S. will have an ambassador before Prime Minister Modi visits the White House end of September?\xc2\xa0 And second, what is happening as far as Mr. Modi\xe2\x80\x99s address to the Congress?\xc2\xa0 Is White House is supporting it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any personnel announcements at this time, Goyal.\xc2\xa0 But when we have any updates in terms of appointing an ambassador to India, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And address -- U.S. address, Mr. Modi\xe2\x80\x99s address to the U.S. Congress, is White House supporting it, the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of those conversations.</p>\n<p>Bill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, there was an unusual editorial in The New York Times yesterday, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw, urging the lifting of the prohibition against -- the federal prohibition against marijuana. What is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position on that?\xc2\xa0 Would you endorse that?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been there for 44 years.\xc2\xa0 Maybe too long and time to change it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I did read the editorial yesterday, Bill.\xc2\xa0 The administration\xe2\x80\x99s position on this issue has not changed.\xc2\xa0 We remain committed to treating drug use as a public health issue, not just a criminal justice problem.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In light of state laws that legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana by adults in Colorado and Washington, the Department of Justice issued updated guidance last August to federal prosecutors in all states.\xc2\xa0 That guidance reiterates that marijuana remains an illegal substance based on the laws that Congress has passed.\xc2\xa0 But it also recognizes that we have limited enforcement resources, and that those resources are best used to address the most significant threats to our communities.</p>\n<p>That was the policy before The New York Times editorial, and it continues to be our policy today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does that mean that if other states follow Colorado and Washington, the administration would also give them a green light to go ahead and legalize marijuana without federal interference?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure a green light is the technical term that the Department of Justice has used.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the guidance that might be offered to those states, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cBlessing\xe2\x80\x9d or whatever word you\xe2\x80\x99d want to use.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The Department of Justice issued guidance like that.\xc2\xa0 So if there are other states that are contemplating these kinds of steps, you should check with the Department of Justice about that.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, North Korea military member had announced that North Korea will attack United States, and especially they point to the White House and Canada with using their nuclear missiles.\xc2\xa0 What is your comment on their threatening like this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have not seen the reports of those specific threats.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would encourage you to check with my National Security Council colleagues about that.\xc2\xa0 The United States remains very committed to our alliance with the Republic of Korea, and that alliance allows us to have a strong military-to-military relationship with South Korea to ensure their security.\xc2\xa0 The United States remains committed as ever to the safety and security of the Republic of Korea.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a strong reaction to them?\xc2\xa0 Because this is the first time they mentioned the White House and Pentagon specifically.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to comment specifically in reaction to those comments because I have not seen them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on Israel please?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Zeke.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Just with regards to the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip tomorrow, can you give us any reason why is he staying an extra night in your hometown if he\xe2\x80\x99s not doing a fundraiser as you said on Friday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At my own personal recommendation.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little bit more about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 This will be an opportunity for the President to spend some time in that wonderful community.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to spend some time talking to individuals who have written him a letter.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on the last couple of trips the President has taken across the country, he\xe2\x80\x99s spent a little extra time in the community to visit with those who have written him letters about the way that individuals in these individual communities are benefiting from some of the policies the President is putting forward and how they could benefit from some of the policies the President is pushing on Congress to implement.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more detail on that tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tuesday night or Wednesday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President is departing tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll remain --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the letters segment, when he\xe2\x80\x99s going to visit people, is that going to be --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe he\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to do that both Tuesday evening, as well as on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other real quick, just on Secretary Kerry.\xc2\xa0 Those leaked conversations or however you want to categorize them, is that jeopardizing the U.S. government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to have candid conversations with the Israeli government?\xc2\xa0 Or do you envision any sort of lasting impact on sort of the relationship between the Obama administration and the Israeli government as a result of these leaks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Tony made clear that we were disappointed to read them.\xc2\xa0 But I do not anticipate that they are going to have much of an impact on the very strong, robust relationship that exists between the United States and our allies in Israel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, finally, does Secretary Kerry coming back to the United States and the President conducting that phone call yesterday and the one today, is this a shift -- is the President going to take a more active personal role now that Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts have at least temporarily failed?\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to try to use his own convening authority?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do anticipate that the President will continue to be in regular touch with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 That has been the case over the last several weeks of this crisis that has been ongoing in Gaza.\xc2\xa0 And I do anticipate the President will continue to get regularly briefed by his team and will continue to be on the phone with his counterparts in the region who have concerns about the outcome here.\xc2\xa0 So I do think that the President will continue to be engaged in this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of the next steps, those conversations will continue.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in similar circumstances as it relates to situations like this, it\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately the responsibility of the two sides to come together.\xc2\xa0 What the international community and what the United States can certainly do is use our influence with both sides to press them to come to an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of their citizens.</p>\n<p>As we\xe2\x80\x99ve pointed out many times, we believe that a cease-fire is in the best interest of civilians on both sides of this conflict.\xc2\xa0 We just need the leaders of both sides to take the kinds of steps that will impose a cease-fire and allow the leaders to sit around the table and try to broker an agreement here.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to be focused on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But over the last week, Secretary Kerry was the point person in trying to bring those two sides together.\xc2\xa0 Has that changed this week?\xc2\xa0 Will the President be trying to bring the two sides to a multilateral agreement together?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess what I would say -- the point that I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make, Zeke, is that I think there have been a range of officials who have been actively engaged in trying to resolve the situation -- the President, first and foremost among them.\xc2\xa0 It was, however, the case last week that Secretary Kerry was the most senior U.S. official on the ground in the region trying to roll up his sleeves and broker an agreement between those who were involved in this situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So those efforts will continue, even though Secretary Kerry is not actually in the region.\xc2\xa0 But if he needs to return, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that he will not hesitate to hop back on the plane and get back to work.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, while you were at the podium, the Supreme Court of Appeals affirmed that Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the third federal court appeals ruling and the latest in an unbroken string in rulings against the marriage ban since the Supreme Court ruling against DOMA last year.\xc2\xa0 Any thoughts on this latest decision and the unanimous string of these decisions against marriage bans?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- as you pointed out, the decision was handed down while I was up here, so I have not had an opportunity to talk to anybody on our team who was able to analyze the decision.\xc2\xa0 But based on the way that you\xe2\x80\x99ve described it, it does sound like the kind of decision that is consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on this topic.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the best I can do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All right, guys, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:04 P.M.
