EDT</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 What we had indicated was the same thing we\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying to you guys for the last few days and the President said for the last few years, which is we\xe2\x80\x99re open to having discussion with the Iranians at any level.\xc2\xa0 We did not have any plan for a formal bilateral meeting here.\xc2\xa0 We indicated that the two leaders could have had a discussion on the margins if the opportunity presented itself.\xc2\xa0 The Iranians got back to us; it was clear that it was too complicated for them to do that at this time given their own dynamic back home.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to pursue this through the channel that the President announced in his speech today, which is Secretary Kerry with Foreign Minister Zarif in the P5-plus-1.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 And if I could just say, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that the process here is what\xe2\x80\x99s important. It\xe2\x80\x99s the fact that Secretary Kerry is proceeding with the P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 When we talk about actions being more important than words, we were open to a meeting, the President was open to a meeting, but the real work on resolving this issue has to be done through substantive negotiations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say it\xe2\x80\x99s too complicated for them, you\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting that domestically, politically, it was not in their interest?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you mean?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask them.\xc2\xa0 I mean, clearly, there are complicated dynamics in Iran surrounding the relationship with the United States.\xc2\xa0 Again, at the same time, I think part of what has strengthened the United States in the international community in terms of our unity is the President\xe2\x80\x99s openness to engage Iran, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated from the beginning of the administration.\xc2\xa0 And I think that indicates that we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to solve this problem, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated not just when we came into office, but most recently with President Rouhani.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to be clear, this was you guys offering an Obama-Rouhani meeting, and the Iranians came back today -- and in what form -- and said no?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Again, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a -- nobody contemplated a formal bilateral meeting or a negotiation of any sort.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not prepared for heads of state to negotiate or Presidents to negotiate on the nuclear issue.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s got to be done through the P5-plus-1 with the foreign ministers.</p>\n<p>What we indicated is, again, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying publicly, which is we\xe2\x80\x99re open to the two leaders having an encounter here at UNGA, not a formal meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So like a handshake?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that type of thing.\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 On the margins here.\xc2\xa0 They, again -- we had discussions at a working level with them and ultimately it became clear that that was too complicated for them at this time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that today?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 That was today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what happened?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into details.\xc2\xa0 Again, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, we had an ability to be in touch with the Iranians at a variety of levels.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing that here in New York.\xc2\xa0 And today, I think it became apparent that the two leaders having an encounter here on the margins of UNGA was not going to happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to press the point one more time.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the French and having other bilats.\xc2\xa0 And not that you were considering a formal bilat, but what was the specific -- what\xe2\x80\x99s your takeaway for why they decided not to do this?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the takeaway is that the Iranians, number one, have an internal dynamic that they have to manage.\xc2\xa0 And the relationship with the United States is clearly quite different than the relationship that Iran has with other Western countries, even.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, I will underscore part of the reason we were able to get international sanctions is because the United States demonstrated that we were willing to engage.\xc2\xa0 Before the President came into office, the United States\' unwillingness to engage was often the issue.\xc2\xa0 And I think because we\'ve demonstrated time and again that we would be open to discussion with the Iranians, that allowed us to rally international support for sanctions and for pressure.</p>\n<p>Now we see a real opening here for a diplomatic process.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s going to be carried forward by Secretary Kerry meeting with his counterpart, which is a significant elevation of the level that that exchange has taken place through that P5-plus-1 process.\xc2\xa0 But the Iranians, at this point, were not ready to have an encounter at the presidential level.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 If I could just clarify on the way that I think one of the questioners described this.\xc2\xa0 This was not a formal offer that then came back because it\'s too complicated.\xc2\xa0 This was a conversation -- some conversations that were taking place about the possibility of an informal, brief encounter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With whom?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\'d just say at the staff level.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 At the staff level.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 U.N. staff or U.S. staff?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into details, but to say staff level.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 And the point is that those conversations resulted in we were open and willing to have that encounter.\xc2\xa0 And in the end, the Iranians -- it was too complicated for them to do it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying Kerry meeting with his counterpart is basically how you foresee that diplomacy going forward?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, look -- and that is where this would be resolved.\xc2\xa0 It\'s important to note that we would never have a negotiation at this point at the presidential level on the substance of any nuclear agreement.\xc2\xa0 The negotiation is going to take place at the foreign minister level and it\'s going to take place through the P5-plus-1 process.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s going to go forward later this week.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President indicated in his speech that Secretary Kerry was going to be tasked with this effort of engaging the Iranians in the P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 And we do see an opening here for progress to be made through that track, and we\'ll continue to pursue it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 The pool has to go.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll be able to read out --</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we\'ll come back after the Palestinian thing.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll be back.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:54 P.M.
