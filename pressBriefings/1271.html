b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>\n\t2:40 P.M. EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the drilling moratorium announcement today, how much did pressure that you guys were getting from the region play into the decision to make the announcement this early?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This was part of a natural policy process. Secretary Salazar, Director Browmich have been down in the region hosting public meetings, talking with stakeholders, talking with the industry to ensure that we came up with the right set of rules and the right set of safety mechanisms to ensure that something that will obviously always carry some risk also has within it a containment strategy that works for the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo this was part of a very deliberative policy process that, quite frankly, just got done more quickly than the original timeline.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the White House reached out to Landrieu to ask her to drop the hold on Lew\xe2\x80\x99s nomination?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Legislative Affairs was, through the normal course of this, going to do their congressional notifications.\xc2\xa0 I saw, I believe, a statement from her that said she was not dropping her hold on Jack Lew.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd our feeling on this is the nomination of Jack Lew is not in any way connected to and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in any way connected to any facet of the moratorium.\xc2\xa0 Jack didn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do with issuing the moratorium, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t currently have anything to do with the moratorium.\xc2\xa0 He passed two Senate committees with more than 40 votes and only one dissenting vote, and obviously a budget director in a time of economic concern and concern about our long-term fiscal picture is somebody that you need at work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe have said from the beginning that the hold was unwarranted and outrageous.\xc2\xa0 And that continues to be our viewpoint, and we hope that as we work though the normal course of a policy that ensures that oil drilling is done in a safe way, certainly that Senator Landrieu would judge Jack Lew on the merits of being a budget director, not of playing politics and getting issues that are ancillary to what he does involved in that equation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if we could just shift to the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign schedule, is there any insight that you can give us into how the decision was made to send him out to the specific states and for the specific candidates that you announced earlier?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me see if there\xe2\x80\x99s any information from Legislative Affairs.\xc2\xa0 Obviously those are -- some of those states we\xe2\x80\x99ve been to -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been to before, and -- look, some places, obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to raise money. Some places we\xe2\x80\x99re going for different activities like the past weekend in Philadelphia, to rally young people in Madison, Wisconsin, and other places like that -- just where candidates and the team here feel like the President could be most useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there places you\xe2\x80\x99ve specifically decided not to go?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can we shift to the mortgage foreclosure?\xc2\xa0 You said this morning that you oppose a national moratorium and that you want to take the just and necessary steps to ensure the process is moving forward legally.\xc2\xa0 Could you say specifically what actions you plan on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- give me one minute.\xc2\xa0 Will you -- I thought I had my list of the different agencies and what they were doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the offshore drilling moratorium, environmental groups are saying this is pure politics and very cynical.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there no political dimension to this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sort of currying favor with voters in the Gulf states?\xc2\xa0 The hold on Lew, no?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure anybody could make -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how anybody could make that equation.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is -- again, this was a very deliberative policy process.\xc2\xa0 And it puts in place, again, some important safety steps to ensure that when this is done again, it\xe2\x80\x99s done safely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAn operator must certify that they\xe2\x80\x99re meeting the requirements of ensuring that a worst-case scenario -- that they have the ability to address a worst-case scenario. We\xe2\x80\x99re asking the CEO to sign off on that process.\xc2\xa0 I think those are a series of very commonsense things that we have to ensure are in place. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut politics in the region, politics outside the region, none of that has played -- none of it played a role in the President\xe2\x80\x99s instituting the moratorium.\xc2\xa0 None of it has played a role in the policy process that\xe2\x80\x99s gone on to devise a way out of the moratorium.\xc2\xa0 It is -- the President wanted to put in place a moratorium that paused deepwater drilling while we figured out what had happened and what needed to be in place.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLook, there are other reports that are going to come out of the Deepwater Horizon spill.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still an engineering report.\xc2\xa0 There are other -- the oil commission, obviously, is looking at this.\xc2\xa0 There certainly will be opportunities for, as that moves forward, for the Department of Interior to examine the evidence that comes back either from the engineers or the oil commission and update that process as we go along.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis is a process that starts the permitting process again.\xc2\xa0 And somebody can drill only when they satisfy the government that they have a process in place to deal with a worst-case scenario.\xc2\xa0 Until that time, drilling can\xe2\x80\x99t happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn terms of this -- I mean, look, FHA has launched a review of servicers to examine the full compliance with the law.\xc2\xa0 HUD, Treasury, FTC and the Justice Department, along with state AGs, are working together and in close communications on the best ways to protect consumers.\xc2\xa0 The officer of the -- Comptroller of the Currency, which has supervisory authority over the biggest mortgage servicers like Wells Fargo and Bank of America, they are reviewing the nation\xe2\x80\x99s -- reviewing the process by which the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest servicers undertake their foreclosure process.\xc2\xa0 There are other things like FHA, FHFA, which oversee Fannie and Freddie.\xc2\xa0 All of that is to say, as we said this morning, that there are -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a process that has to be followed, a legal process, and if that process isn\xe2\x80\x99t being followed by anybody along the way, then that can and should be rectified.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe also have pointed out, though, that the idea of a national moratorium would impact the recovery in the housing sector, as anybody that wished to enter into a contract or execute a contract to purchase a home that had previously been foreclosed on, that process stops.\xc2\xa0 That means houses and neighborhoods remain empty even if there are buyers ready, willing and able to do so. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo we want to protect consumers.\xc2\xa0 We support what state attorneys generals are doing in looking into the mortgage process to ensure that consumers are protected.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering, first of all, if you had any reaction -- a federal judge has granted an injunction of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was told something about that as I walked out.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to DOJ, as I assume they will analyze the briefing.\xc2\xa0 Obviously you know the President\xe2\x80\x99s view on changing the law in \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay. This is the 10th anniversary of the bombing of the USS Cole.\xc2\xa0 After becoming President the President withdrew the prosecution of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri as you guys got your house in order as to what to do about the defendants and detainees at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 Since then the Pentagon prosecutors have been eager to go forward with the case and they have been stopped by the interagency process.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any update as to what\xe2\x80\x99s next for al-Nashiri, when that trial will go forward?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The important -- one of the most important parts of that process, Jake, as you well know -- and I think you touched upon it -- is -- was working with a bipartisan coalition in Congress to review and reform the military commission system to ensure that that process would and should be used -- could be used to bring terror suspects to justice.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe Attorney General referred five cases, including al-Nashiri, to the Department of Defense, and as you said, there is an interagency process that is being worked through, and certainly our hope is now that we have a reform commission system that it\xe2\x80\x99s a process that can start soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you shed any light on what the holdup is?\xc2\xa0 There are obviously families who are grieving today, the 10th anniversary of the bombing.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a desire for information.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on the timing.\xc2\xa0 Obviously DOD and DOJ are working through this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tObviously our viewpoint is that somebody who did harm to American servicemen 10 years ago will be and should be brought to justice.\xc2\xa0 That was our goal in reforming the military commission system, and I believe in this case we will see justice done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, as somebody -- there are a lot of us here who have covered the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and now his White House, and a lot of times you guys are subject to accusations that are baseless and grounded in no more than, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it could be true; make them prove that it\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And that seems to be the argument you\xe2\x80\x99re making towards the Chamber of Commerce when it comes to these foreign donations -- it could be true; have them prove that it\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that the President -- there should be a higher bar for when the President levels or suggests or insinuates a charge?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, what I would do is go back and look at what the President has said directly on this.\xc2\xa0 The President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very careful with his language, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 But the suggestion is it could be true; they should open their books.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, the -- as we covered in this morning\xe2\x80\x99s briefing, or gaggle, that I get asked questions and others around this town get asked questions about people that have donated to the campaigns that you mentioned that you follow because people that give in excess of $200 are required to report who they are and who they work for.\xc2\xa0 Simple disclosure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe know that -- we know, because the Chamber has said, that they take money from overseas.\xc2\xa0 We do know that they\xe2\x80\x99re spending $75 million to $80 million on ad campaigns -- with anonymous donors.\xc2\xa0 They know the identities, but the American people and the voters in these individual elections do not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe best way to clear any of this stuff up would simply be to disclose the names, the identities of those donors.\xc2\xa0 That goes for groups on any side of the political spectrum. When you have, in the case of this election -- there are outside groups on the Republican side that are largely supplanting the role of the national party, certainly to the extent to which they are participating as an active entity in this election.\xc2\xa0 And no one knows where that money is coming from.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis is an important election.\xc2\xa0 And those groups owe it to the American people to tell us who they are, to describe based on that identity what their agenda is, why are they so heavily involved in these races.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt seems like a fairly simple thing to do.\xc2\xa0 The President talked about this as early this year as the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 And we tried desperately to get a law passed that would require those identities to be disclosed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the conference call earlier.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Salazar was asked whether additional inspectors have been brought in to carry out some of these new reforms, to make sure that these oil companies are abiding by the guidelines, and the answer was, no, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- the numbers have not been increased since prior to the accident.\xc2\xa0 So how can the American people sort of be assured that these inspections will be able to be carried out when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the personnel perhaps to do it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Dan, let me go back and see what DOI was referring to in terms of -- what they were referring to in terms of additional inspections that meet the law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn this process, applications for re-permitting of exploratory deepwater wells will be examined and reviewed, and permits issued based on their ability to meet the requirements of a worst-case scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But then inspectors would be following up to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re abiding by whatever the guidelines are.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I would need to get more information, and I would have you ping also the Department of Interior.\xc2\xa0 But what is crucial in this process is ensuring that -- and this is -- this would be through the signature of the chief executive officer of the operating company -- that they certify that they do indeed have all the resources readily available to respond to that worst-case scenario.\xc2\xa0 That is what would now be in place in order to continue a deepwater drilling project that is underway in the Gulf.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the First Lady out on the campaign trail, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing more of that now.\xc2\xa0 What are you hoping to accomplish by having her out there campaigning?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think she is an invaluable asset to this White House.\xc2\xa0 I think she has -- as she told during the 2008 election, she\xe2\x80\x99s got a story to tell about herself and her family, and I think she will tell that story and what the administration and some of these candidates have been able to do to help the families that they represent.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think she\xe2\x80\x99ll -- I think she will be -- she will go out and have a very affirmative case for coming out and participating in this very important election.\xc2\xa0 I think she\xe2\x80\x99s -- like I said, she\xe2\x80\x99s an invaluable asset, and my guess is we\xe2\x80\x99ll get good response out there on the campaign trail.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Part of her appeal has been that she\xe2\x80\x99s non-political, in terms of what she gets involved in.\xc2\xa0 Any risk at all in sort of throwing her into this hand-to-hand campaign?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see her make -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll see her make a very positive case for these candidates, not get involved in the back-and-forth of normal political campaigns.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, at the gaggle, you suggested that the reason the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring up the Chamber of Commerce issue was he was just giving an abbreviated version of his usual address at fundraisers.\xc2\xa0 But are you suggesting that he\xe2\x80\x99s not backing off this at all?\xc2\xa0 When he holds fundraiser for Coons on Friday and Patrick on Saturday, he goes to Cleveland in Columbus, are you telling us this will be a major part of his address?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, it will be -- it will definitely be part of his address, absolutely. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not backing off one iota.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to back off asking for the disclosure on these --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of criticism, I mean, from fact-checking organizations and from newspaper editorials, and a lot of people saying, this is the kind of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None of whom have seen --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- unsubstantiated, harsh attacks that he --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None of whom have seen the list of donors that is being protected and whose identities are being protected.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tChip, if there are organizations raising tens of millions of dollars who won\xe2\x80\x99t tell us who their donors are, my guess is they\xe2\x80\x99re not telling us for a reason -- because they have something to hide.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYet they spend -- they supplant an entire national political party, spend tens of millions of dollars, in the end, in total, probably hundreds of millions of dollars without knowing who they are, what their agenda is or who they represent.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not good for our democracy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you define Rove-ian trick?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In this case, it was -- it was very much to try to take a similar example far out of what the discussion point is in order to distract you all away from asking for their donor list.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in other cases?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this something with a broader application? Rove-ian trick, is that sort of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Likely. (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that something we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find in Webster\xe2\x80\x99s in a --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Likely, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Bill Safire\xe2\x80\x99s dictionary?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the question was, well, how come this think tank won\xe2\x80\x99t disclose its donors.\xc2\xa0 Well, look, that might be an interesting debate to have, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the debate that we\xe2\x80\x99re having about the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s tens of millions of dollars on TV for and against certain candidates. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIf -- as I said this morning, if that was a group that was advertising on television, the President has not reserved his criticism for the masking of the identities of these political donors based on who they are advertising for or against.\xc2\xa0 He believes that whether you are supportive of Democratic candidates, Republican candidates, in some cases both, the identities of who funds those campaigns is pertinent to the debate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President approve of the DNC saying -- and believe, as the DNC ad says -- that the Chamber of Commerce is apparently taking money, using money from foreign sources in its political endeavors?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether the President -- I have not talked to the President about that ad, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You won\xe2\x80\x99t go -- you won\xe2\x80\x99t go that far?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I have not talked to the President about that ad.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to what the President has said on this subject, which is to lay out that -- as the Chamber has said, they take money from overseas.\xc2\xa0 We know they\xe2\x80\x99re spending millions of dollars.\xc2\xa0 Who is that money coming from?\xc2\xa0 And where is it coming from?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Chamber\xe2\x80\x99s dues from foreign affiliates account for less than two-tenths of a percent of the $40 million plus -- $40 million to $50 million they\xe2\x80\x99re spending on political endeavors this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Have you seen the list of their donors?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the bigger problem the legal use of money from domestic donors that may have an agenda?\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you seriously think that the possibility of illegal use of foreign funds is as big a threat?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the identity -- I think that a small number of people might write tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in checks to fund and bankroll a campaign or a series of campaign ads in order to defeat certain candidates because they have -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a political ideology; it\xe2\x80\x99s what business do they have in front of the federal government.\xc2\xa0 What regulation are they trying to impact with -- by getting involved in certain Senate races? What\xe2\x80\x99s their legislative agenda?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEasier to answer if you knew who we were talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not illegal.\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99re foreign it\xe2\x80\x99s illegal.\xc2\xa0 But if they\xe2\x80\x99re domestic it\xe2\x80\x99s not illegal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say the biggest point in this is disclosure.\xc2\xa0 The biggest point is knowing what\xe2\x80\x99s out there.\xc2\xa0 The biggest point is who\xe2\x80\x99s involved. That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President mentioned, again, at the State of the Union many, many months ago.\xc2\xa0 And we had -- there was a bill to do just this, because the President warned that -- warned pretty clearly what might happen if those identities were shielded from the American people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tChuck.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on -- actually, to follow up on the bill that you just brought up, Democrats on Capitol Hill mishandle that bill?\xc2\xa0 Did they cut too many deals -- the exception for the NRA, the exception for labor unions -- and so politicized it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The biggest problem was 99 percent of Republicans voted against that bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, they voted against the bill after the deals were cut.\xc2\xa0 Were too many deals cut?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it should be a simple deal, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, correct?\xc2\xa0 This bill -- could this bill have been simplified?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It should be who are your donors.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that was not what this bill said, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re probably following some aspects --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand, but I mean --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- more than I am.\xc2\xa0 But --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but it does sound like you feel like this bill wasn\xe2\x80\x99t simple enough.\xc2\xa0 Could have been simple, straightforward --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, I think when people filibuster the bill because people don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to know who their donors are, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s -- there was a ruling and a campaign put together in order to gather up tens of and hundreds of millions of dollars to affect an election, with the promise that your identity would never be known.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s gotten all that money rolling into TV stations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another housekeeping.\xc2\xa0 One, when\xe2\x80\x99s the last time the President talked to the Chilean President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The Chilean President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, about the miners.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I will check with NSC.\xc2\xa0 Not in my recent memory have I seen anything on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, on the drilling moratorium, by lifting this moratorium, does this mean the federal government has a better -- do you feel like you guys have a better sense of what caused the Deepwater Horizon explosion; that this was a uniquely BP situation?\xc2\xa0 Is that sort of how people should interpret this moratorium?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think a couple of different ways, which is why I mentioned to -- I think it was to Dan\xe2\x80\x99s question, that there are still -- there\xe2\x80\x99s still an outstanding commission, there\xe2\x80\x99s still an outstanding engineering report that may very well, depending on its findings, impact the process, which is important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut we know that -- again, we know there\xe2\x80\x99s inherent risks in doing this at all.\xc2\xa0 That we understand.\xc2\xa0 But the belief of the Secretary, I think rightly so, is that each operator has to certify what the worst-case scenario is, and that they have the ability to meet that scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a very commonsense way of looking at how we go about this process, and one that we think, based on the quality of permit applications, can be met by operators.\xc2\xa0 It won\xe2\x80\x99t be --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you feel as if the industry, as a whole, does have a handle on how to keep this the safest.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that they understand now far better what has to be in place, and what they risk if something like this gets out of hand, which clearly it did in the Gulf with the Deepwater Horizon. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one campaign question.\xc2\xa0 There were five Senate debates last night, three time zones, all over the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 But two big issues debated -- stimulus -- the Recovery Act and health care all came up in all of them.\xc2\xa0 And it was -- it was all familiar.\xc2\xa0 The Democratic candidate never cheerleaded the bill.\xc2\xa0 The Republican candidates, both said both were failures, both were mistakes, would repeal.\xc2\xa0 But in each case the Democratic candidate said, well, it was okay, or the health care bill -- well, it was a good start, it was a decent compromise.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel as if you guys need to help these Democratic candidates essentially sell the -- I mean, because none of them were saying the Recovery Act was a success; all of the Republicans said it was a failure. None of them were saying that health care was a great piece of legislation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 What we did was -- what that bill did was make sure that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a systemic economic meltdown that led to a Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s how it should be judged?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s known.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not me saying that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not -- that\xe2\x80\x99s economists saying that it led to increased growth; that it created and saved jobs; that it turned our economy around.\xc2\xa0 Now, are there people that will still deny it?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think if you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Democrats are having trouble sort of telling that story. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble telling that story.\xc2\xa0 I think that we live in an environment where we\xe2\x80\x99re not losing 800,000 jobs a month, we\xe2\x80\x99re not losing 3 million jobs in six months as we were at the end of 2008, but we\xe2\x80\x99re climbing out of, very slowly, a hole that lost 8 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s going to be economic frustration not just from the past two years, but built up over many years, as wages failed to go up, as hours increased, as jobs were moved overseas, as businesses made a series of bad decisions that required the government to step in and ensure that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t do irreparable harm to our economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNobody likes doing that. Nobody sat in meetings here and said, boy, let\xe2\x80\x99s do this because this would be great and politically popular.\xc2\xa0 But we know what happened -- what would have happened if the financial sector would have melted down.\xc2\xa0 How would the debates go in the Midwest if GM and Chrysler and the million or so people that were connected both working directly for those auto companies and the auto parts suppliers, many of which, if you drive by some of these auto plants, are built next to those factories -- where would we be if a million more people were out of work?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWell, you know, look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s up to Republicans to -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched them in Michigan say we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done that to help Chrysler and GM.\xc2\xa0 And I hope voters will take them at their word that many of their friends and many of their neighbors would have been out of work, without the prospect of a lot of new jobs coming to town, manufacturing has taken a beating.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut, look, I understand that some legislative efforts in things like rescuing the economy -- we get that the judgment on a political timeline might not always match up with I think how ultimately this will be viewed, as creating a new foundation that stimulated new industries to create the jobs of tomorrow, which prevented, as I said, a meltdown into a Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And we are all aware of the economic study that shows had some of these steps not been taken -- stabilized the financial system and in the Recovery Act -- that hole that\xe2\x80\x99s 8 million jobs deep would likely have been twice that.\xc2\xa0 And that would be the Great Depression that we are thankful was warded off because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t do necessarily what was popular, but we did what was right and what had to be done at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, may I --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I should run for something.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess you want to participate in these debates.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was watching the Braves and the similar outcome.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the moratorium -- the deepwater moratorium, the lifting of the moratorium has a lot of caveats.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the redesigned blowout preventers, more equipment on hand in case of accidents, things like that.\xc2\xa0 How quickly does the President want to see these rigs back out doing exploratory drilling?\xc2\xa0 And do you believe that these new regulations are going to chase away all the small companies and leave only the mega oil companies out there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On that latter point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s going to chase away -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s going to chase away those companies because, Jonathan, I think we want to ensure that whoever is doing that exploratory drilling and participating in those activities has the ability to handle something if it goes catastrophically wrong.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99d ever want to permit something that we can\xe2\x80\x99t -- that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t unwind, that we can\xe2\x80\x99t meet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn terms of how quickly, I think Director Bromwich and others have said some of this is going to depend on the quality of the permit applications themselves.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously not going to happen overnight.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to take several weeks to ensure that everybody feels comfortable that we have the appropriate plans in place to ensure that we meet those worst-case scenarios.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think this is an important first step.\xc2\xa0 It starts that process.\xc2\xa0 It opens that process back up. And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has there been any contact, any outreach -- I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked this -- but with Mary Landrieu and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check.\xc2\xa0 I would be shocked, quite honestly, if Legislative Affairs didn\xe2\x80\x99t give Senator Landrieu, Senator Vitter and all those along the Gulf Coast a heads-up on this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- let me check specifically on that reaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, if the law doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require political groups to disclose their donors, how can you say that these groups owe it to the American people?\xc2\xa0 I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re abiding by the law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the spirit of political disclosure is -- and remember, too, that the law was -- the last has just recently been struck down by the Court.\xc2\xa0 The notion of disclosure was struck down by the Court.\xc2\xa0 The notion of political donor anonymity was established, and I think many in Congress believed that -- although not enough -- believed that understanding who those people are is important to the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThere are -- it is hard to understate, Mark, how much they\xe2\x80\x99re impacting some of these elections.\xc2\xa0 In some of these states, there are four, five, six of these groups up at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re just commercials.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, probably radio ads, TV ads.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think most people would admit that\xe2\x80\x99s the way a bunch of people, most people, get the information that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- how they determine who\xe2\x80\x99s going to vote -- who they\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote for, excuse me.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important -- when you don\xe2\x80\x99t know who those people are, when you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what their agenda is, I think, as the President has said, that is a threat very fundamentally to our democracy.\xc2\xa0 There are people impacting those elections with which you have no identity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the spirit of political openness ought to embrace the President when he does closed-door fundraisers? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, just last night the President brought a print pool into --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but for ones that were closed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They were, but here\xe2\x80\x99s what you know, Mark.\xc2\xa0 Every person that gives to an entity that the President is raising money for -- the DCCC, the DSCC, the DNC, Obama for America in 2007 and 2008 -- if you give in excess of $200 -- and I think in our case we actually disclosed a lower amount -- but if you give in excess of $200, we know who you are -- not only we -- you, the FEC, it\xe2\x80\x99s posted on the Internet -- who you are, who you work for, where you live.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s basic disclosure.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in the spirit of openness, if he\xe2\x80\x99s addressing big money donors, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be open to coverage?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this -- I will say this, Mark, I think we had one or two that weren\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was more than that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you have the exact number.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do. (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I bet it was less than five.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s closer to 10.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How many have we done?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fifty something.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay. I\xe2\x80\x99d put our openness, Mark, against anybody\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 It was a policy that we had during the campaign.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t something that we waited to institute when we got there.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken as many steps as we\xe2\x80\x99ve can to ensure that when the President speaks to these groups, that you know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why are there different rules for some of these things?\xc2\xa0 Why do you say, well, print for this?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the point of keeping TV cameras out?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not the point of keeping TV cameras out, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 I trust that your friends are -- that are doing pool reports are relaying what the President says quite accurately.\xc2\xa0 But, Chuck, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- no offense, but to take you, your producer, to take one other guy, to take a bunch of people --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have a pool.\xc2\xa0 We have a very small group of people.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not a very small group of people, but some people have private homes that we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we just -- you can\xe2\x80\x99t bring that many people into. But, Chuck, let\xe2\x80\x99s not get diverted from the fact that you know exactly what the President said last night, you know exactly -- you will know exactly who gave, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know the amount they gave, you will know their name and where they work.\xc2\xa0 You will not know any of that on these groups that sound like \xe2\x80\x9cMom and Apple Pie\xe2\x80\x9d that are running tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars of ads affecting big parts of Senate races, big parts of House races, big parts of gubernatorial races.\xc2\xa0 Obviously a separate series of laws govern gubernatorial races. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy, Mark, if the groups that have advertised in these races on either side met the transparency standards that we have met and that federal candidates are required to meet, because you\xe2\x80\x99d know the identities of who gave that money.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tRoger.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you have more closed fundraisers?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that -- every one I think we have is -- will be open, as far as I know.\xc2\xa0 And I think all the ones that we announced today -- the DCCC, the DNC events -- I know are open.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Delaware?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe Delaware is open.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I will double-check on that when we get out of here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the oil moratorium, the Interior Department rules say that the new rules are going to add about $183 million in annual costs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s about $500,000 a day.\xc2\xa0 Jonathan asked you about chasing --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, tell me the figures again, where are they from?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 $183 million a year in annual costs under the new rules.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s about $500,000 a day. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 $500,000 a day for the 30-some exploratory --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- spread out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan asked about chasing away the independents, and I heard you say that you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s going to chase them away.\xc2\xa0 But do you know?\xc2\xa0 Or is there any evidence?\xc2\xa0 How do you know --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back and look -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back and ask, and you should ask DOI about what cost-benefit analysis they have.\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, Roger, the point is we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to permit -- large or small -- somebody that does not have the ability to certify accurately and adequately a containment strategy if the well they are drilling can\xe2\x80\x99t be contained in a worst-case scenario.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense regardless of the size of the operator.\xc2\xa0 That wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense for those communities along the Gulf, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re employing people that work on those rigs, or you have a business like the seafood industry that might be affected by an accident.\xc2\xa0 These rules are put in place to ensure that the standards that are in the law are adequately met, that that can be certified and signed off on by the chief executive officer, and that the steps to put in place those safety requirements are taken seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s any concern that when the Interior Department holds the next auction for leases that it will only be the Exxons and the Shells and even the BPs that will be able to afford it, and therefore the government would get fewer bids at lower prices?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t because I think that is -- obviously oil is a fairly known commodity with a known price.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other -- something, separate subject.\xc2\xa0 Senator Mitchell met with Biden this morning on the Middle East -- or was to.\xc2\xa0 Did that happen?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on that, but I can try to find one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any update on resolving the impasse?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update on that meeting, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if there is one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In New York, the first civilian trial for a Guantanamo detainee is underway.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if you could just reflect on what the stakes for the administration are in the outcome of this trial?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously this is an individual who is on trial for and accused of his role in deadly embassy bombings that killed Americans.\xc2\xa0 And we are serious about bringing to justice those that have harmed or killed our citizens, be it the al-Nashiris of the world who\xe2\x80\x99ve done so by doing harm to our service members, killing civilians or government employees in embassies, and to bring to justice those that seek to do our citizens harm -- or have done them harm.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is this a referendum on the ability of civilian courts to handle Guantanamo detainees?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- look, I think this is an important trial in terms of bringing about justice. There have been cases where suspects -- last week there was a -- obviously the Times Square bomber was sentenced to -- in an Article III court -- was sentenced to life in prison.\xc2\xa0 So we know that these work.\xc2\xa0 We also know that we have a reformed military commission that can also bring those at Guantanamo -- that were housed at Guantanamo to justice and will do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just two questions.\xc2\xa0 The Los Angeles Times reported that Obama White House aides owe the IRS $831,000 in back taxes.\xc2\xa0 What will the President do about this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to check on that and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done so, so let me do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did the President schedule a 12-day trip to the Far East, beginning on November 4th, instead of remaining home in the possibility of the need for a major Democrat rebuilding?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a 10-day trip that starts the 5th. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It said 12-day in the print.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I was in a meeting about it this morning.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t disagree.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, our --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many in this room get screwed with 12 days.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, well, sorry.\xc2\xa0 Ours is I guess a more direct flight.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLook, our relationship with the world, Lester, is tremendously important.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t grow our economy unless we can export our products overseas.\xc2\xa0 Asia is the fastest-growing market in the world --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why not do that later, so that he can, if he needs, rebuild the party of which he is the head?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 One, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to do that, Lester.\xc2\xa0 And two, this is an important election, but there\xe2\x80\x99s also important work to be done with -- in countries like Korea, in Japan and in India, in ensuring that we have the type of relationships around the world and the type of business relationships in the world that can buy and sell the products we make here and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJackie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, could you just spell out why you think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good argument to be pushing this issue of the foreign money and whether it exists or not, is disclosed or not, at a time when we\xe2\x80\x99re this close to the election and people are sort of looking for the closing argument?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think people care about -- let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, I think people care very much about who these people are and who these people are that they don\xe2\x80\x99t know. And understand that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what their agenda is.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to elect a group of senators to roll back Wall Street reform.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole lot of things we don\xe2\x80\x99t know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think -- look, if you look at the Bloomberg poll today, it was one of the most -- it was one of the most likely -- if you look at the percentages of \xe2\x80\x9care you more likely to support or less likely to support somebody who has advertising in that race on their behalf,\xe2\x80\x9d it was a pretty persuasive concern for voters.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that jibe with your own polls?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen anything in DNC polling on it that I can remember.\xc2\xa0 I think people are very concerned about, again, not knowing the identities of these special interests, not knowing where they\xe2\x80\x99re from, not knowing what their -- not knowing what they want from government, not knowing what they want from the senators that they seek or the House members that they seek to elect. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow on Chuck\xe2\x80\x99s question about the stimulus.\xc2\xa0 Even as Republicans are out campaigning and calling the past stimulus or the existing stimulus a failure, you have a lot of nonpartisan economists and analysts who have said that it did its job, it just maybe should have been larger, and that in fact part of our problem right now is that the stimulus is waning and that there arguably should be some more.\xc2\xa0 Was that what was behind Secretary LaHood yesterday saying that you\xe2\x80\x99ll push sooner rather than later for the $50 billion in transportation funding?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say, first and foremost, we have -- we met the goal of ensuring that 70 percent of the money from the Recovery Act was spent by the end of the most recent fiscal year.\xc2\xa0 We met that goal.\xc2\xa0 But understand that that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of funding to get into an economy in a very short period of time.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s still some funding that continues, obviously, that has not -- that\xe2\x80\x99s been obligated but -- and projects are underway, though the money, the check hasn\xe2\x80\x99t finally been written -- the economic activity is happening.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, I think those statistics bear that we not just got what we could politically bear but we got into the economy what could be gotten into the economy in as quick a period of time, and to do so without waste, fraud and abuse. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn terms of infrastructure or expensing or some of the proposals that the administration continues to have, some of them are built off of existing ideas that were in the Recovery Act that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see extended. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tInfrastructure -- obviously there was major investments that were made as part of the recovery, but we also know that a great deal of the unemployed that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with used to be in the construction industry as the housing market has waned, that have the skills that could be put to use in infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 We know that\xe2\x80\x99s a good investment for long-term economic growth and we think that puts people back to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo all of those go into what the economic team has proposed and what the President has proposed to continue to see our economy strengthen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But those arguments like he made yesterday suggest like acting sooner rather than later.\xc2\xa0 But are you going to try in a lame-duck Congress to get some sort of emergency spending, or are you going to rule that out?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that most of what the President has proposed is likely to be dealt with when Congress comes back in January.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last thing on undisclosed money.\xc2\xa0 Ginny Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, has formed this group for which she solicited and accepted, as far as we know, unknown -- contributions from unknown sources of up to $500,000.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House think that\xe2\x80\x99s an appropriate activity for the spouse of a Supreme Court justice?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me take a look at that and get back to you on that.\xc2\xa0 I just -- before I go --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Just breaking news out of California, Judge Virginia Phillips just issued an injunction of all \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d discharges, effective immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I got this question right as I came out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You did? Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I saw it literally as we were walking down, so let me point you initially to DOJ.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Guess who I already have a question into?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Those good guys at DOJ, call her back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes. I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, do you know if there\xe2\x80\x99s been any discussion inside the White House of how to -- of what kind of steps might be taken to bring the Pentagon into compliance with such an injunction?\xc2\xa0 I mean --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, like I said, I learned of and haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to talk to as we were walking down here anybody in the counsel\xe2\x80\x99s office who might have had an opportunity to read this more closely. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tObviously there have been a number of court cases that have ruled in favor of plaintiffs in this case.\xc2\xa0 And the President will continue to work as hard as he can to change the law that he believes is fundamentally unfair.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any idea of whether or not you\xe2\x80\x99re going to work for a stay?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, but that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the questions that I had as I was walking in, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get somebody from counsel to help me with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A very small question left over from Sunday.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked whether the President saw the streaker who was trying to win a million dollars at the rally.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Whether the President saw the streaker? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he know the name of the website?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, come on.\xc2\xa0 Poor guy needs a million bucks.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Stimulus.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he did.\xc2\xa0 I -- now you\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask me to walk into the Oval Office and see if the President saw the streaker. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Others might.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Next question is about Brett Favre.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to the streaker question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the book?\xc2\xa0 Did he know about the book?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it your view, Robert, that China is softening its stance on territorial claims in the South China Sea this week, based on the release of the Vietnamese fishermen?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some better guidance from NSC on that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGlenn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you guys have complained for quite a while about sort of these unsubstantiated Republican charges about death panels and birth certificates and all that kind of thing.\xc2\xa0 Does it feel kind of good to hear them carping about the accuracy of your statements with regard to the Chamber?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, but let\xe2\x80\x99s take the example that you -- the example that you had of death panels, okay?\xc2\xa0 That might seem -- might have seemed like a more plausible charge if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a piece of legislation in front of you. Remember -- are you going to read the bill, are you going to look at this section, are you going to go through this?\xc2\xa0 You had the piece of legislation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo let\xe2\x80\x99s just have an analogous political argument, and that is let\xe2\x80\x99s put out the names, put it in the list, put it in a form -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it would stack up quite high -- put out the names of the donors and let people make a judgment based on the evidence. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s the one thing you could do with health care, right?\xc2\xa0 You could -- you had a piece of legislation that you could -- and why the myth was so thoroughly debunked, it\xe2\x80\x99s because people read the legislation and said, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not in there.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list of who\xe2\x80\x99s giving secret money to these secret groups. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had like, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, between this morning and now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a dozen questions about this, we\xe2\x80\x99ve eaten a lot of clock.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that to a certain extent one of the reasons why we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about this, so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to talk about other things like the economy or other issues?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think this is very much part of the economy.\xc2\xa0 Understand this, Glenn, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the identities.\xc2\xa0 I wish I did.\xc2\xa0 I bet when we finally do find out who these people are, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to find out their political agenda is to go back to the rules that we had governing Wall Street before we passed financial reform.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut, Glenn, all you got to do, if you walk right out that door, right up that nifty new set of steps, walk across that nifty park, there\xe2\x80\x99s a big building right over there. Right?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a bad Sam Youngman golf shot.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I had you right up until that, right? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying -- what I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you -- what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, Glenn, is it\xe2\x80\x99s a short walk, right?\xc2\xa0 Email the Chamber and tell them you\xe2\x80\x99ll meet them over there in 10 minutes.\xc2\xa0 Have the list.\xc2\xa0 Put the entire argument to rest with the list.\xc2\xa0 Put the entire argument to rest with Karl Rove and Ed Gillespie by providing the list.\xc2\xa0 Why perpetuate the argument?\xc2\xa0 Why distract from all the other things we could be talking about by just simply providing the list?\xc2\xa0 That seems easy.\xc2\xa0 Simply disclose the identities of who funds all these ads.\xc2\xa0 No longer hide behind the shroud of secrecy and anonymity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSimply tell us who you are. It will probably be pretty easy to figure out what your agenda is.\xc2\xa0 But generally people that are looking for that shroud of secrecy in keeping their names anonymous have something to hide.\xc2\xa0 It would be easy -- just walk right over there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Including environmental groups and all the others that also get money anonymously? All of them should disclose all of their donors?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re running TV ads in this election --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the White House position?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It has been since the President stood in front of Congress in the State of the Union.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even groups that support this White House?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Even groups that support this White House.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you calling on them now to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Robert, listening to you in this briefing, again, they have the cover of the law behind them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You got to get a shorter guy sitting in front of you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry. (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, they have the cover of the law behind them.\xc2\xa0 But just listening, it\xe2\x80\x99s sounding like -- and you tell me if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong -- they have deeper pockets than we do, and we\xe2\x80\x99re upset, and we want them to disclose even though they have the cover behind it -- let me -- you\xe2\x80\x99re upset because they\xe2\x80\x99re winning in the ad game.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am -- they have the ability to influence elections.\xc2\xa0 They are supplanting the entire effort of a national party to the tune of $150 million, $160 million, $180 million in a political campaign.\xc2\xa0 And you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the slightest idea who they are.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t know who they represent.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what their political agenda is.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for in their next United States senator.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for somebody to walk down there the first day and sign on to repealing the laws that we have instituted to change the way Wall Street works.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut they\xe2\x80\x99re going to impact this election.\xc2\xa0 If it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the discussion we\xe2\x80\x99re having now, this would likely be the biggest story after the election -- $200 million, $150 million -- some huge amount of money that is playing out in races all over the country, and nobody knows who they are.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a threat to the democracy that we have this country.\xc2\xa0 I think that is what is fundamental about who we are and what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake in this election.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s very far back -- but some of your deputies say there may be something happening outside that people are interested in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Does somebody want to go see George Clooney?\xc2\xa0 Sam, do you have something you want to -- (laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m still reeling from that sucker punch.\xc2\xa0 Per our agreement from last week, the Auburn University Tigers are a superior football program to the University of Kentucky Wildcats.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nobody will argue about basketball so I appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThank you, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what about the book?\xc2\xa0 What about the book, Robert, the book that was thrown? Did the President know about it, and what was the end result about the book?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to him about it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the book?\xc2\xa0 What was the book?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A million dollars.\xc2\xa0 Stimulus, man.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:39 P.M.
