EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to the great state of New Jersey, which, as you know, has been devastated by Sandy.\xc2\xa0 You know the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule:\xc2\xa0 He will be taking an aerial tour with Governor Christie of some of the areas that were most affected by storm damage, and he\'ll be discussing with local officials the response effort and recovery effort underway in New Jersey.</p>\n<p>As you know, earlier today, the President went to FEMA, where he held a briefing at FEMA\xe2\x80\x99s National Response Coordination Center, and was joined by Secretary LaHood, Secretary Sebelius, Secretary Chu, Secretary Napolitano, Administrator Fugate -- who is with me today -- Secretary Panetta, Secretary Donovan, Chief of Staff Jack Lew, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security John Brennan, and other senior members of his team.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden joined the briefing by video teleconference. In addition, U.S. NORTHCOM Commander General Jacoby joined by video teleconference.</p>\n<p>Administrator Fugate is with us today, and I asked him to join me so that he could answer some of your specific questions about recovery and relief efforts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Before he left, the President also placed a phone call to NYU -- and let me get that information here -- where he spoke with NYU Langone Medical Center dean, Dr. Grossman; the chief nursing officer, Dr. Glassman -- that would be Dr. Robert Grossman, the dean and CEO of the Medical Center; and Dr. Kimberly Glassman, chief nursing officer at NYU Langone Medical Center.</p>\n<p>Dr. Grossman and Dr. Glassman were responsible for the safe evacuation of over 200 patients after the hospital\xe2\x80\x99s power generators failed.\xc2\xa0 I think we all are aware of the story -- the President mentioned it yesterday on his visit to the Red Cross and I think highlighted it as an example of how, in response to disasters like this, Americans come together to help one another, neighbors help neighbors.\xc2\xa0 And it was a heartening story about, as the President said, in the darkness of the storm, the brightness of America shown through.</p>\n<p>With that, we\'re here to take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Again, I have with me FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the President make of all the attention that\'s kind of been focused on the very effusive praise that\xc2\xa0 Governor Christie lavished on the President yesterday, and in terms of optics today of -- we\'re six days from the election, and the President going to New Jersey with a strong supporter of Governor Romney?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say that this is a time to focus on what was a devastating storm and the terrible aftermath of that storm.\xc2\xa0 New Jersey was, by many measures, the hardest hit state -- I believe that\'s correct -- and it is entirely appropriate for the President to visit New Jersey and receive updates on the efforts there to recover and to view firsthand the damage inflicted by Sandy.\xc2\xa0 This is not a time for politics.\xc2\xa0 And the President appreciates the efforts of governors, state and local officials, across the various states that were affected by the storm, regardless of political party.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is he hoping to get out of it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 The President has overseen the federal response effort, as you know, for these past several days.\xc2\xa0 He has been meeting regularly with the entire federal team that has been coordinated by Administrator Fugate, and directed them to spare no effort, to lean forward in their response to the storm and in the provision of assistance to states and localities that have been affected by the storm.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, there have been -- there were, I think, about 10 emergency declarations signed by the President that went out before the storms.\xc2\xa0 New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut have all received major disaster declarations that includes individual assistance, whereby individuals in affected counties can apply directly for aid.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Administrator Fugate has more information on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does he hope to get out of this --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, he\xe2\x80\x98s overseeing -- as part of his job to oversee the federal response effort, he wants to see how bad it is.\xc2\xa0 He wants to meet with Governor Christie and other local officials to hear from them directly and in person about the response efforts.\xc2\xa0 He wants to thank those first responders in New Jersey, and while he\xe2\x80\x99s in New Jersey, those first responders in other states who have done such remarkable things and acted so heroically in order to prevent further loss of life and damage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some background about how this trip came about, who initiated it?\xc2\xa0 Was it Governor Christie\xe2\x80\x99s office that reached out to the White House?\xc2\xa0 I mean, who specifically from the White House was the go-between?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the specific details on that.\xc2\xa0 I think, in general, when we have incidents like this, natural disasters like this, and the President travels to the location, that we are very careful about making sure that the places that we visit, we are not using resources that would otherwise be used in recovery efforts.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the case here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We reached out I believe to New Jersey and worked with the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s office to make this trip happen.\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s been reported that there were discussions about New York.\xc2\xa0 It was the assessment at the White House that because of the situation in Lower Manhattan, it would not be appropriate for the President, for the very resource allocation issue, to visit New York at this time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when Mayor Bloomberg said that he made the point to the White House that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t appropriate, he was not correct on that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he was agreeing with our assessment, which is that it was not appropriate at this time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one more follow-up question?\xc2\xa0 At a rally for Mitt Romney today, former Governor Jeb Bush -- and Administrator Fugate, I wonder if you could respond to this -- Bush said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy experience in all this emergency response business is that it is the local level and the state level that really matters, that if they do their job right, the federal level works out pretty good.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that?</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the system.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re called the federal government, and our job is to support the governors and their teams.\xc2\xa0 And I think when you look at the states impacted, there are four that are going to primarily need federal assistance beyond just a normal grant -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and West Virginia where it\xe2\x80\x99s still snowing.\xc2\xa0 So these are the areas where we have active requests for commodities, generators, and other support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the system is always built upon the federal government supports the states; the states support local governments.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the investment in Homeland Security dollars has been so critical in building up more robust capabilities, allowing state and local responders to deal with the most immediate lifesaving missions, while we backstop them, including the Department of Defense for the type of catastrophic impacts we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you at a point right now where you can make an assessment for a state like New Jersey as to how long this recovery process is going to take, or it still too early?</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 When did the storm stop blowing?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re still -- you look at -- the first thing was search and rescue.\xc2\xa0 We mobilized the Federal Emergency Management Agency\xe2\x80\x99s Urban Search and Task Forces to support New Jersey.\xc2\xa0 Swift Water Rescue -- the lead federal agency was the U.S. Coast Guard.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We still do not have the primary all-clear.\xc2\xa0 So we are still checking and looking for people.\xc2\xa0 And, unfortunately, I think -- we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten to all the living, and now the next step will be to go and look for those that were lost, particularly in the fires, the flooding.\xc2\xa0 The Coast Guard still has an active search on for the missing captain off of the HMS Bounty.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re moving right now from search and rescue to the immediate needs.\xc2\xa0 One of the things Jay talked about the President did was, in declaring the disaster, people can start registering for FEMA assistance.\xc2\xa0 And probably the most important one is people that have had flood damage to their homes, that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be able to go back, can start registering.\xc2\xa0 What we want to do is get them rental assistance and give them a place to stay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>When a lot of people\xe2\x80\x99s power comes back on that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be what really needs to happen, but there were homes that were flooded and destroyed, or are so badly damaged they need a place, they need help.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And one follow-up -- yes, I know there\xe2\x80\x99s no power and the Internet is not going to help and you can\xe2\x80\x99t call 1-800-FEMA.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we also put people on the ground, starting today, to go door to door, start getting into those neighborhoods.\xc2\xa0 It will take time to reach everybody.\xc2\xa0 But we also are aware that those that can call in can call 1-800-621-FEMA.\xc2\xa0 And people already have registered.\xc2\xa0 You can go online.\xc2\xa0 Our website is mobile friendly, so you can register online if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got connectivity. But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go into the neighborhoods with the state and reach out to everybody that may need assistance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- about using assets in a novel way, maybe bringing the military to bear more than has been done in the past.\xc2\xa0 Can you cite any examples of things that you\xe2\x80\x99re doing maybe a little differently this time to expedite the recovery?</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Everybody looks at this going, we\xe2\x80\x99re doing things differently -- I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking, no, this is how we planned for it.\xc2\xa0 When you look at the number of people -- this is a large population -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to bring a lot of stuff ahead of time.\xc2\xa0 And you look at the role of the Army Corps of Engineers, NORTHCOM -- this is what we\xe2\x80\x99ve designed the whole system for in these types of events when it goes beyond what the governors\xe2\x80\x99 teams can do.</p>\n<p>A lot of disasters is financial assistance.\xc2\xa0 This one is getting stuff there based upon the populations at risk.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s so much novel as much as, yes, this is how we\xe2\x80\x99ve been planning it, but this may be the first time since Katrina you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we talk about environmental concerns on the water? There\xe2\x80\x99s a whole bunch of subway water.\xc2\xa0 Where do you pump it out? There\xe2\x80\x99s a bunch of gas on top of it; raw sewage in the Potomac River that there\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about if it floods.\xc2\xa0 And that was front page of the Post.\xc2\xa0 Where does this stuff go?\xc2\xa0 How do we -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the plan to --</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Guess what, it happens when it floods.\xc2\xa0 This is not novel.\xc2\xa0 The lead for this will be the Coast Guard and U.S. EPA, working with state environmental agencies.\xc2\xa0 They are already identifying where there are sheens, where there are spills.\xc2\xa0 They have contractors on support.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo part of this remediation will be making decisions about how to mitigate some of the hazards where cleanups need to occur. So that assessment is also taking place.\xc2\xa0 And as the Coast Guard, shifting from search and rescue, their what we call ESF 10, the HAZMAT function, will be one of their activities going through the next days as they get in there and see what\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you identify places where you would pump this water to, particularly in New York City?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 This is, again -- the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is going to support the locals in pumping.\xc2\xa0 Part of it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be what\xe2\x80\x99s the contamination, what has to be done immediately.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I kind of walk around with this as I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to all the questions, but our job is getting smart people there that can answer the questions to get things done.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with this team.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Part of the federal role here is to expedite the assistance that the federal government can provide.\xc2\xa0 This effort has been led by Administrator Fugate.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that came out of the President\xe2\x80\x99s call with utility companies last night is that FEMA established a power restoration working group, which includes a representative of the utilities at the National Response Coordination Center to cut through the red tape, increase federal, state, local and private coordination, and restore power to people as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is a very high priority of the President.\xc2\xa0 And in that conversation with utility executives yesterday, he praised the companies in their efforts thus far and the bravery of linemen who are involved in restoring power in sometimes dangerous situations.\xc2\xa0 But he made clear that we need to collectively give 100 percent to that effort, because power restoration is such a vital component of recovery.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there was some question yesterday about statements that Mitt Romney had made during the primary debates about turning some of the FEMA funding over to the state or even to the private sector.\xc2\xa0 And I was curious, does the President have a response to that in Romney\xe2\x80\x99s non-response to those questions yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is really a day not for politics, but for focusing on the damage caused by the storm.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re in New Jersey.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President will be viewing some of the hardest hit areas in this state.\xc2\xa0 So I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment on a political matter right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you be more specific about why New Jersey is different than New York in terms of diverting resources from --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about -- well, Administrator Fugate can talk about the allocation of resources.\xc2\xa0 I think both states were extraordinarily hard hit.\xc2\xa0 New Jersey I think was hardest hit of all by some measures.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the President coming and not diverting resources?\xc2\xa0 Why is it okay for him to go to New Jersey and not New York?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the White House and Mayor Bloomberg that because of the unique nature of the damage to Lower Manhattan and the resources that need to be brought to bear there, that it was not appropriate for the President to visit Manhattan today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did he scrub the trick-or-treat tonight?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the East Wing for more details on that.\xc2\xa0 I think they put out a statement that it was because of the storm.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Administrator Fugate, can federal money -- this disaster aid be used to get the election happening in these states on Tuesday?\xc2\xa0 Is that money usable for that?</p>\n<p>ADMINISTRATOR FUGATE:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what happened in 2004 -- we had so many places that were impacted, at polling stations, that the Florida Supervisor of Elections had requested assistance in getting temporary facilities back up.\xc2\xa0 We worked with FEMA and it was eligible funding.</p>\n<p>But the actual part -- who does what, what needs to be done -- is a state responsibility.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re able to support, as a state puts in a request for anything, to support the actual polling operations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, thanks so much.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Fugate.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:03 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
