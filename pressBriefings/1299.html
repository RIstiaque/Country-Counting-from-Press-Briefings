EDT<br/>\n<br/>\nMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Before we start, I just want to call your attention to something that I read in The New York Times this weekend.\xc2\xa0 It is a quote from Republican Leader Mitch McConnell about his views on what he wished he could have done this past year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\'m amused with\xe2\x80\x9d -- this is to quote Senator McConnell -- \xe2\x80\x9cI\'m amused with their comments about obstructionism.\xc2\xa0 I wish we had been able to obstruct more.\xc2\xa0 They were able to get the health care bill through.\xc2\xa0 They were able to get the stimulus through.\xc2\xa0 They were able to get the financial reform through.\xc2\xa0 These were all major pieces of legislation, and if I would have had enough votes to stop them, I would have.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>I think that\'s proof positive of how Republicans view their role here, and more -- another example of how they\xe2\x80\x99ve stood on the sidelines and rooted for failure as opposed to actually getting involved to help move this economy forward again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about this when he talks about -- you know, the story about driving the car into the ditch and all that.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\'t be surprised if it came up again today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Bill, the President keeps framing this as a choice.\xc2\xa0 But the comment you just read, whatever he\xe2\x80\x99s going to say today, is this the kind of back-and-forth that he thinks that the public wants to hear?\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this the kind of partisanship that he ran against?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Choices are about pointing out what the different visions for the country are.\xc2\xa0 And the choice here is what the President and Democrats in Congress have been able to do in order to help make progress on the economy.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s not satisfied with the pace of this recovery, but we have been able to make some progress.\xc2\xa0 What you see here is the Democratic vision, which is continue to make progress, keep on with the policies that are moving us out of this crisis, or what we just saw here from Senator McConnell, which is the opposite.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s do nothing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obstruct the progress we\'ve been able to make.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can\'t you make the point about a choice without taking shots?\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a way to do it at a higher level?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would disagree with the premise of your question.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that that\'s taking a shot.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s reading back the words and the -- with the sentiment that Republicans in Congress have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I mean during the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments, he certainly likes to single out cases where he thinks Republicans are being hypocritical or he thinks they\xe2\x80\x99re falling down on the job.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s seems to enjoy that part of it.\xc2\xa0 Is that not fair?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would say there are moments where individuals say things to help to illuminate the choice that voters are going to have this fall.\xc2\xa0 The President is happy to showcase those moments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the message of the event today?\xc2\xa0 I mean, can you talk more about what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing today and why he\xe2\x80\x99s going there?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, hopefully you\xe2\x80\x99ve already gotten the -- did you get the background on the event?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Okay, I just wanted to make sure it went out.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to be talking about some of the pro-growth policies that we\'ve put into place that are helping to create jobs and move the economy forward.</p>\n<p>This particular plant is going to be adding, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s 80 jobs, as a result of new investment and the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re manufacturing something that people abroad and domestically are interested in buying.\xc2\xa0 So the President will be talking about what we\'ve done here and what we need to continue to do in order to make sure that businesses like that can thrive and create jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mayor Barrett\xe2\x80\x99s opponent for governor, the Republican opponent, is actually saying that the train that you guys -- the high-speed rail that you want to build between Madison and Milwaukee is a boondoggle that he wants to stop.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t seem worried about running against these stimulus programs.\xc2\xa0 What do you make of that?*</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\'s what this choice is all about.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s between what our vision of continued growth and moving in the right direction on the economy versus attempts to stop economic progress.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to this specific issue.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like a Wisconsin issue to me.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a boondoggle?\xc2\xa0 You used to live in Chicago.\xc2\xa0 Will people take the train from Milwaukee to Madison?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: I\xe2\x80\x99m not an expert on transportation issues in Chicago and Madison.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that these grants -- the investments that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made on renewable energy, on infrastructure, are helping to make our economy stronger and are helping to create an environment where jobs are being created and people getting back to work.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did the President decide to weigh in on the mosque issue?\xc2\xa0 It seems like a local politics issue that -- and he keeps on wading into local politics and sort of stirring up a little bit of tension.\xc2\xa0 Why did he choose to weigh into this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President thinks that it\xe2\x80\x99s his obligation to speak out when he thinks issues of the Constitution are -- when issues of the Constitution arise.\xc2\xa0 And so, in this case, he decided to state clearly how he feels about making sure that people are treated equally, that there is a fairness and that our bedrock principles are upheld.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you, have you had any -- has the President heard from or reached out to any world leaders, especially in Arab -- in Muslim countries, about this mosque issue?\xc2\xa0 Have you guys heard on the international front whether this mosque issue is having an impact abroad?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke to this because it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue domestically about our Constitution.\xc2\xa0 But to the extent that our Constitution is something that is a real shining light about our nation and helps to give people around the world a better understanding of who we are, then, sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there a worry that anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States might be impacting U.S. foreign policy in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Pakistan?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\'s sort of a broader existential question that\xe2\x80\x99s separate from the issue at hand here, and not something that I\'ve talked specifically to the President about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Republicans pushed back pretty hard against the President on the mosque issue.\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you think they\'re running -- does the President think that they\'re running a risk, a political risk -- not a political risk internationally, but a risk internationally?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Are Republicans -- do Republicans have an international risk as a result of -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the politics of what the Republicans are doing.\xc2\xa0 And the President didn\'t do this because of the politics.\xc2\xa0 He spoke about it because he feels he has an obligation as the President to address this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think from his perspective that the matter is done for now?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s said his piece and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to let it go its course?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this kind of a done issue for him?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a pretty fulsome conversation about it.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, me and Gibbs and Pfeiffer don\'t have any control over what happens on cable television or in your newspapers.\xc2\xa0 So I assume that people will continue to talk about it, but I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed this to a pretty full extent.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this a debate, though, that you guys want to have?\xc2\xa0 Is this a discussion that you think the nation should have about sort of the appropriate role and should this mosque be built?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s a debate that was had and we\'ve weighed in.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about Petraeus?\xc2\xa0 He said yesterday on \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d that he might recommend next year that the President slow down his -- not begin the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I looked at that, and I think that that is a very thinly sliced parsing of what he had to say.\xc2\xa0 He said very specifically that that deadline stands and there is no daylight between the President or his commanders on the ground when it comes to July 2011.\xc2\xa0 As you saw with Iraq, when the President makes a commitment he keeps it.\xc2\xa0 And he intends to do that here as well.</p>\n<p>Obviously the scope and rate of withdrawal will be conditions-based, but the date is not negotiable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re saying that no matter what Petraeus says, might say next year, the President is going to begin a drawdown?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you about a lot of things, but I can\'t say what Petraeus might say next year.\xc2\xa0 The date is the date.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Financial Times is reporting today that the President personally called Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey and warned him that Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s positions on Israel and Iran could affect U.S. arms sales to Turkey.\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I really don\'t know where they would have divined that from.\xc2\xa0 The President and Erdogan did speak about 10 days ago and they talked about Iran and the flotilla and other issues related to that.\xc2\xa0 But we obviously have an ongoing dialogue with them.\xc2\xa0 But no such ultimatum was issued.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No warnings, no hints, no nuances?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no ultimatum.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any response to President Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s decision today to say that all private security contractors will have to disband in Afghanistan within the next few weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I saw the reports of that, but we haven\'t seen any sort of edict or anything like that.\xc2\xa0 I would check back, but we haven\'t seen that in other than the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the latest on BP with the well and the kill well?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Thad Allen is going to be briefing today at 12:30 p.m.\xc2\xa0 I think you can get the latest information there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any details on the scope of the fundraising this trip?\xc2\xa0 Have you heard any outer number about how much money is going to be raised across these stops?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the DNC for that stuff.</p>\n<p>All right.\xc2\xa0 Enjoy breakfast.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n10:08 A.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
