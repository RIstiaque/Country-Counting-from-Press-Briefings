CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m working on him.\xc2\xa0 Anyway, sorry, the President spoke with Senators Reid and McConnell, Leader Pelosi and Speaker Boehner to discuss progress we are making in negotiations to find a balanced approach to deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 The President will also hold a meeting at the White House today at 2:50 p.m. with House and Senate Democratic leadership. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those are my announcements.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All eight?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As we have other meetings to announce, we will announce them.\xc2\xa0 But the meeting we have to announce for 2:50 p.m. today is with the Senate and House Democratic leadership.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Four or eight or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 At least four.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 Haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- they\xe2\x80\x99re still working on the manifest.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Photo op?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s four.\xc2\xa0 Let me get back to you on the coverage.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on that, why are the Republicans not involved, and how did the conversation go with Boehner?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read out the individual conversations, except to say that they were obviously useful and productive. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have been having conversations and meetings with different groupings of leaders and rank-and-file members, and we will continue to do that at the presidential, vice presidential and staff levels.\xc2\xa0 This meeting is the next one up.\xc2\xa0 We will get back to you with announcements of other meetings as they happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the goal of today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting?\xc2\xa0 What does he want to accomplish?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 To discuss approaches for further deficit reduction, balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the role that the Gang of Six is playing now in adding to the, we think, the momentum behind the principle that the best way to do this -- the only way to do it, really, to do significant deficit reduction, is to do it in a balanced way; to do it so that we go after all the drivers of our long-term debt, including non-defense spending -- discretionary spending -- defense spending, entitlement spending and tax code spending -- so to further those conversations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are, as the President said yesterday, in the 11th hour.\xc2\xa0 We need to meet, talk, consult, narrow down what our options are and figure out in fairly short order which train we\xe2\x80\x99re riding into the station.\xc2\xa0 Right now there are multiple options being discussed, including the work that Senator McConnell is doing with Senator Reid and others.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the Gang of Six proposal. There are obviously the President\xe2\x80\x99s framework and other proposals out there.\xc2\xa0 And we need to do decide, through the course of these meetings and discussions, eventually what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do to ensure that, at the very least, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, the United States does not, for the first time in its history, default on its obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple other quick ones.\xc2\xa0 Can you discuss the President\xe2\x80\x99s challenge in swaying Democratic leaders to go along with changes in entitlements?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s not leave it at Democratic leaders.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the Democrats --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, for today -- yes, today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, as representatives of the Democrats in both the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 This is an important point that you raise, because while we have certainly spoken a lot about and made clear that we believe Republicans need to be willing to compromise, need to accept that they won\xe2\x80\x99t get 100 percent of what they want, that this is a two-party system and a divided government and it requires compromise and bipartisan cooperation in order for big things to get done -- the same is true for Democrats.\xc2\xa0 And the point the President has been making both in public, and in private in these meetings, is to take political heat in order to argue -- successfully, he believes -- to his fellow Democrats that we need to make some tough choices in order to ensure that we can reduce our deficits, get control over our debt -- precisely because that is the best thing for our economy, and it allows us to continue to make the absolutely necessary investments we need to make in education, in research and development, and in infrastructure to allow the economy to continue to grow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s that case he has been making to Democrats and will continue to make.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, I know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone over this debate about the real deadline considering Congress\xe2\x80\x99 timetable for legislation.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain how it\xe2\x80\x99s possible -- or when do you run out of time to get something as big as a Gang of Six piece of legislation through?\xc2\xa0 I mean, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point you to the comments that the OMB director made over the weekend that there is still time if everyone is serious and committed to achieving a big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, time is running short.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the deadlines we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, August 2nd is a real and fast deadline.\xc2\xa0 We must take action to deal with our debt, raising the debt ceiling before then.\xc2\xa0 But there is still time to do something significant if all parties are willing to compromise -- because the parameters of what that might look like are well known, especially to the participants in the negotiations the President oversaw last week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And going back to -- because I may get the question, is it July 22nd, is it the 23rd -- this is, again, an estimate about what it takes to move something through Congress.\xc2\xa0 There is the almost -- the sort of ineluctable modality of the way the Congress works that you have to accept that things can\xe2\x80\x99t turn up and be voted on and reconciled and all the things that need to happen all in one day.\xc2\xa0 So you need to move back from August 2nd from there.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to guess, and we\xe2\x80\x99d leave it up to the leaders of Congress to provide their best estimates rather than us.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to buy yourselves some time, are you going to have to go with the McConnell plan or a short-term deal, so you can take a little more time, negotiate the broader package?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are, as you know, supportive of the efforts by Senators McConnell and Reid to craft a fallback provision, solution, that ensures that we take the necessary action on raising the debt ceiling.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when I was talking about which train we\xe2\x80\x99re going to ride into the station, right now there are multiple trains heading towards the station and we have to decide.\xc2\xa0 And some of them may continue up to the last moment, because we need to be sure that that failsafe option is there -- even as we pursue, aggressively, the possibility of doing something bigger.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has been clear that he will not support a short-term extension of the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 There is no reason why we cannot come together now and get something significant done.\xc2\xa0 So what we mean by that is we would not support a short-term extension absent an agreement to a larger deal.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not acceptable.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, if both sides agree to something significant, we will support the measures needed to finalize the details of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as you saw -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to what I just said a minute ago -- Jack Lew over the weekend made clear that because we know what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a willingness\xc2\xa0 -- and we believe there\xe2\x80\x99s a growing willingness on Capitol Hill\xc2\xa0 -- if there\xe2\x80\x99s a willingness to do something significant and comprehensive and balanced, we can get that done within the time frame and by the deadline of August 2nd.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you briefly about Libya.\xc2\xa0 The French are saying that Qaddafi could stay in power -- or could stay in Libya if he gives up power.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the U.S. would support?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The United States\xe2\x80\x99 position has always been that Colonel Qaddafi lost his legitimacy to lead and that he needs to be removed from power, remove himself from power.\xc2\xa0 It is up to the Libyan people to decide what his future is beyond that. So it\'s not for us to say. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The issue here is that he needs to step down.\xc2\xa0 He\'s lost his legitimacy.\xc2\xa0 He is increasingly isolated not just from the world but from his own country.\xc2\xa0 The opposition has made significant progress.\xc2\xa0 The international community, together with the United States, is taking the steps necessary to recognize the TNC as the provisional government and, with the aid of doing that, freeing up funds for the opposition to use, the TNC to use.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In so many ways -- the Qaddafi regime is running out of fuel and cash.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are so many ways that he\xe2\x80\x99s really running out of time.\xc2\xa0 So the issue here is removing himself from power, no longer being a threat to the people of Libya.\xc2\xa0 And then it\xe2\x80\x99s up for the Libyan people to decide their own future, including what that means for Qaddafi if he\xe2\x80\x99s not out of the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if he stays in the country, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to quibble with that is what I\'m --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is for the Libyan people to decide.\xc2\xa0 Our position is quite clear about his retaining power and -- or rather giving up power and no longer being a threat to his people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a position, now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a chance to review it, on the Gang of Six plan beyond the general support for principle -- its principles that the President discussed yesterday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would say is that again, as I said yesterday, it represents significant, broad support along the lines of the approach that the President took.\xc2\xa0 There are -- as we look at the provisions within it -- and as you know, there was some level of detail provided and more coming -- it\xe2\x80\x99s possible we may not agree with every aspect of their approach.\xc2\xa0 But the issue here isn\xe2\x80\x99t which piece of paper will be the final piece of legislation because that\'s going to be -- if the decision is made that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take a bipartisan approach, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take a balanced approach, the framework that the President put forward, that the Gang of Six has now put forward, that Simpson and Bowles Commission has put forward, and others, are all available to create a process that produces a piece of legislation that we believe a majority in Congress would support and certainly the American people would support, and the President would sign.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The details of that obviously would have to be worked out. But the frame here -- savings out of the tax code, savings from entitlement reform, significantly reduced nondefense discretionary spending, reduced defense spending that\'s done in a way that protects our national security -- this is the way to go about it.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s how you get to the $3.5 trillion and above savings over 10 years that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, and that the Gang of Six is talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So as long as there\xe2\x80\x99s political will, the details -- there\xe2\x80\x99s enough substance out there now for a package to be crafted.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- I would note that one of the things that either Speaker Boehner or his spokesperson said last night was that there was some similarity between what the Gang of Six had put forward and what the President and the Speaker had been talking about when they were looking at the possibility of achieving a grand bargain.\xc2\xa0 So again, that\'s the -- we agree with that assessment.\xc2\xa0 And if the will is there, we can get down to negotiating the details.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t -- so there\xe2\x80\x99s no change?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a specific provision of the Gang of Six\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to declare from here that we accept or reject. The overall approach we definitely accept.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, others, including the Speaker of the House and the President of the United States, have been having discussions about what a grand bargain would look like concretely.\xc2\xa0 So there is a framework with details that has already been worked on, that this helps propel the -- or create momentum behind the possibility that we could actually move in that direction.\xc2\xa0 It may --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If this were to become legislation, would the President sign it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make a declaration about the specifics of what the Gang of Six has put forward, in part because all the details aren\xe2\x80\x99t even known yet.\xc2\xa0 This is not a piece of legislation -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not even written as a bill, so we would not issue a statement of administration policy or make a declaration about whether the President would sign it based on an outline.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What he does wholly support is the approach that they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken because he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s the right approach.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that overwhelmingly we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen now the American people support -- Americans who are both Democrats and Republicans and Americans who are independents -- they all support this kind of approach.\xc2\xa0 So we find that very encouraging.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What reason do you have or does the President have to be optimistic that the House Republicans or the House of Representatives in general can muster a majority vote for anything other than the cut, cap and balance bill?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The reason to be optimistic is that the members of the House of Representatives were elected by the American people, by their constituents in their districts.\xc2\xa0 And if they listen not just to the loudest voices, especially those in special interest groups, who argue that they should or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do one thing, but take into account the views of all of their constituents, we believe that a majority in both houses would support a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 And in the end, listening to the voices of the people who elected you, who sent you to Washington is really what you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to do and what this is all about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we believe that there are some signs that -- certainly many signs of a growing willingness to consider this approach among Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a positive thing.\xc2\xa0 So we obviously understand that the political dynamics in the Congress are pretty complicated, and we\xe2\x80\x99re a step removed from it, but keen observers of it.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to make the case and work with the leaders of Congress and other willing participants among the rank and file that this is the approach that will best serve the American people, will best serve the economy, and will best serve the political interests of everyone because doing the right thing in this case is good politics.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just -- faith in humanity is your answer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, like I said, we\xe2\x80\x99re said we\xe2\x80\x99re keen observers of the dynamic up there and we think there is reason to be optimistic that something like this could be achieved.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, it takes a lot of work and willpower --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Keen observers of what?\xc2\xa0 Are you watching --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Of the political dynamic in the Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What specifically is the political dynamic that you\xe2\x80\x99re observing that gives you faith that they\'re going to support anything that has tax increases in it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have -- we believe there has been significant -- as more and more attention has been paid to this issue, there has been a significant amount of acceptance, broadly, by Democrats, independents, and Republicans, including elected officials, that a balanced approach that requires compromise on all sides is the right way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, we continue to push for the biggest deal possible, and that would include a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 We are also pragmatic and realistic and committed to the notion that we absolutely must take action before August 2nd in order to not create a situation where the United States could default on its obligations.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, we are pursuing, as well -- even as we pursue the bigger prize, we are working with Congress to ensure that there is a mechanism by which we simply raise the debt ceiling, or raise the debt ceiling and do something much smaller than the grand bargain.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think it\'s important to note that the members of the Gang of Six represent in many ways progressive Democrats and very conservative Republicans.\xc2\xa0 It is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not talking about the Senate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know you\'re not, but these are not a distinct -- this is not a distinct species even within the political categories that we\'re talking about.\xc2\xa0 And we have a little faith in the capacity of our elected leaders in Congress to hear what the American people are telling them, hear what their colleagues are telling them, and hopefully create majorities within both houses to do the right thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to try to be a little more specific, after the President made his statement praising the Gang of Six yesterday, Senators Reid and Durbin came out saying there\'s not enough time and this would probably have to start in the House, where its path to passage is more tricky.\xc2\xa0 McConnell was noticeably, decidedly silent.\xc2\xa0 And Leader Cantor was critical of its revenue component -- very critical.\xc2\xa0 So you keep saying, if there\'s the will.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House think there is the will to pass this in the Senate -- in Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We think there should be, and there could be.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not laying bets that it\'s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 But we would be -- it would be a failure of leadership to simply give up because the odds aren\xe2\x80\x99t overwhelmingly in our favor.\xc2\xa0 And that would be true if it were the right thing to do even if the majority of the American people didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it were the right thing to do if we firmly believed it was. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In fact, the President firmly believes it\'s the right thing to do, and the majority of the public believes the same thing.\xc2\xa0 So we believe that -- we continue to make the argument, we continue to negotiate, we continue to look at the avenues available to us to make something bigger happen, even as we, very pragmatically, negotiate and try to work out something small.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that the clock is ticking and that there is this McConnell-Reid plan that seems maybe the likeliest path to get the debt ceiling raised, mechanically, what is the advantage of pushing something that seems more like a Hail Mary pass?\xc2\xa0 Mechanically, what do you think can get done by pushing the Gang of Six?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\'s important to note, and I tried to make this clear yesterday, we\'re not -- the President has not endorsed the specifics of the Gang of Six.\xc2\xa0 The President was involved in negotiations on a grand bargain with his own proposals and his own ideas that mirror broadly what the Gang of Six is doing.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not like we\'re -- we\'re not saying that it\'s Gang of Six and their plan or bust, first of all.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second of all, we have the capacity to do two things at once, which is negotiate the smaller deal and negotiate the potential for a bigger deal.\xc2\xa0 It would be -- we would be failing in our responsibilities not to do that, because we believe that a bigger deal remains possible.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re not alone.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of members of Congress who believe that.\xc2\xa0 And while you did point out that there were some cold water poured on this idea by some folks, overwhelmingly, the reaction I think was notably positive in Congress yesterday -- in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And even some of the leaders, some of the things they said, I would point to you and note that there were some positive statements said by leaders in both houses of both parties about the work of the Gang of Six.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we press on.\xc2\xa0 And we acknowledge that we have to be sure that there is a backup plan, because the United States will not default.\xc2\xa0 The United States President, working with Congress, will take the action necessary to ensure that we raise the debt ceiling, we pay our bills, bills that were rung up in the past and need to be paid.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to fight for something bigger and better that addresses the big problem here, which are the sizeable deficits that we confront and the drag that the long-term debt problem creates for our economy, and address it in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s balanced so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t do something that actually contracts the economy or slows it down or reduces job creation, but enhances it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any hindsight concern that he was a little too enthusiastic in his embrace of the Gang of Six and that as a negotiating --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hindsight?\xc2\xa0 This was 24 hours ago.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 We are immensely enthusiastic about the fact that yesterday six members of the Senate -- three Republicans, three Democrats, progressive and conservatives -- came together and put forward a proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s balanced, that deals in a significant way with our deficit problem and our long-term debt problem.\xc2\xa0 That is a significant deal and it is worth being enthusiastic about. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it happens -- one of the reasons why we\xe2\x80\x99re so enthusiastic about it is because it mirrors the approach the President has been pushing for some time now.\xc2\xa0 It mirrors the approach that Simpson and Bowles, that their commission put forward and that Domenici and Rivlin put forward in those two bipartisan commissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we think it further -- one of the headwinds we\xe2\x80\x99ve been dealing with in talking about this, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve made the case that the President is pushing for a bigger deal and a balanced approach, is that, well, we know that Republicans who aren\xe2\x80\x99t in Congress are arguing increasingly that we should do this, but what about elected members of Congress?\xc2\xa0 Well, what the Gang of Six put forward yesterday, and the support they got after they put it forward from their colleagues of both parties I think is an indication that that headwind is dissipating.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Norah.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the President was immensely enthusiastic about the Gang of Six plan.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that the Democratic leadership in the Senate is also enthusiastic about it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will go right back to the question that Ben asked, which is that it is -- the President feels it is his responsibility and it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility he takes on willingly to make the case to Democrats, rank-and-file Democrats and members of leadership, about why a significant balanced deficit reduction package is the right way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would remind you, of course, that Senator Durbin is a member of leadership and he\xe2\x80\x99s a member of the Gang of Six as well.\xc2\xa0 Senator Alexander, while not a member of the original Gang of Six, is a supporter of it and is a member of the Republican leadership.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is part of the meeting today, first with Democrats and alone with Democrats, to make the case to them to move forward on this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, there are -- they will have a discussion about the potential for a big deal, the potential for a medium-size deal, and the work that\xe2\x80\x99s being done to ensure that there is a failsafe, fallback alternative if we are not able to reach agreement -- regrettably not able to reach an agreement on a more significant deficit reduction package.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure everybody will have important things to add to that conversation.\xc2\xa0 The President will continue to argue that -- with both sides -- that since none of this is easy, none of these votes are going to be easy for members of either party, that this is an opportunity, then, to go ahead and think big and try to get something significant done that actually has long-term positive impact on the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, but if you look at the whole Gang of Six deficit reduction plan, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a plan to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 That would take an enormous amount of time to do all of that, even get a bill put forward.\xc2\xa0 So the President would accept a short-term extension alongside an agreement for larger deficit reduction with some triggers?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me turn it around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 If both sides agree to something significant, we will support the measures needed to finalize details.\xc2\xa0 But there is no extension without an agreement on something big -- a firm, committed agreement on something big.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so the point -- we are not wavering on the President\xe2\x80\x99s absolute assertion that he won\xe2\x80\x99t sign a series of ill-defined -- a sort of tollbooth kind of series of provisions that temporarily or in a limited fashion raise the debt ceiling, and we have to relitigate this again and again and again -- not just because it\xe2\x80\x99s unpleasant -- in fact, not principally because it\xe2\x80\x99s unpleasant for everyone involved, but because that\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the economy.\xc2\xa0 It sends the wrong signal to everyone around the globe about Washington\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to deal with its fiscal issues. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one of the things that I think is quite clear is that if we send a signal from Washington that Washington works, that Washington can tackle big problems, that that will have a significantly positive impact around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And it will remind people about why the United States is the best country to invest in; why we are, as we have always been, a safe harbor in terms of the security of your investments.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an important signal to send.\xc2\xa0 So we look forward to doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Wendell.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are only six or seven Republicans in the House that haven\xe2\x80\x99t signed the Americans for Tax Reform pledge.\xc2\xa0 As you understand the Gang of Six proposal, is it possible to support that and not violate the pledge?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I used to be someone who analyzed Republican Party politics for a living; I am no longer.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that what\xe2\x80\x99s needed here is the political will to get outside of one\xe2\x80\x99s comfort zone, and that\xe2\x80\x99s true for Democrats as it is for Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And that would be required for anything that is significant in size in terms of the deficit reduction packages that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would note, however, that there are -- there have been some important voices who have pointed out -- and some of them are elected officials in the Republican Party -- who have pointed out that no one here is talking about raising -- and certainly not the President of the United States, who has lowered taxes for working and middle-class Americans ever since he took office -- about raising taxes on those people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about at the minimum is closing loopholes, ending subsidies that give unfair advantages to industries or simply aren\xe2\x80\x99t justifiable in a time where we all need to tighten our belts in order to reduce the deficit and get our fiscal house in order.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give political advice to either -- the members of either party, but I think there is -- it is certainly a worthwhile argument to make that closing a loophole is not raising an average American\xe2\x80\x99s taxes.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s simply not.\xc2\xa0 When you end an unfair advantage that the makers of private jets enjoy -- tax advantage -- or the subsidies that the oil and gas companies enjoy, you\xe2\x80\x99re actually -- and by using that money to reduce the deficit and allow for a balanced package, a more balanced package, that therefore does not require as much burden on middle-class Americans, you\xe2\x80\x99re doing everyone -- you\xe2\x80\x99re doing the broad swath of the American people a favor and doing it right in a balanced way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that would be the argument that I would make and others who I\xe2\x80\x99m sure have more swack within the GOP have been making.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the elements of the Gang of Six proposal is a 29 percent top income tax rate.\xc2\xa0 Could the President live with that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the itemized specifics of the proposal and what we can and cannot support.\xc2\xa0 What the President has said is that he does support tax reform, and it has, I think, been reported that what a broad compromise might look like would involve some tax reform.\xc2\xa0 So beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to the folks who are actually negotiating a deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has Budget Director Lew advised the President how long it would take to score this proposal?\xc2\xa0 Whether or not you will tell us that number, has the President asked him how long it would it take to score it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, CBO does the scoring, and not the OMB.\xc2\xa0 But the -- I would just point you to what Jack Lew said over the weekend -- that was just three days ago -- but that he believes, based on what he knew -- and he knows quite a lot, having been around this block a number of times in his career -- that there is time in Congress to get a big deal done, and that would include everything necessary to write and pass legislation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would remind you about Jack Lew.\xc2\xa0 This is an important -- this is somebody who was with Tip O\xe2\x80\x99Neill when Tip O\xe2\x80\x99Neill did those compromises with President Ronald Reagan.\xc2\xa0 He was with President Clinton when President Clinton had those compromises with Speaker Gingrich.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s here today.\xc2\xa0 And this is somebody who knows how this works and how bipartisan compromise can work with people who are viewed as staunch progressives and staunch conservatives:\xc2\xa0 Tip O\xe2\x80\x99Neill and Ronald Reagan; Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s ample precedent for why this should work, and plenty of historical precedent for members of Congress to look to and say, I did what Ronald Reagan would have done, or I did what Tip O\xe2\x80\x99Neill or Bill Clinton would have done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you say there\xe2\x80\x99s time to get this through if there\xe2\x80\x99s political will.\xc2\xa0 Are you particularly looking at the Senate, where one member has the power to at least slow things down?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re looking at both houses.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not direct participants but keen and close observers of what happens in Congress and we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of how it works and its modality.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at all of these factors.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the White House disagrees with Harry Reid?\xc2\xa0 Harry Reid said there was no time to do -- to get Gang of Six as the vehicle to raise the debt ceiling; that maybe if they move it concurrently, you get debt ceiling raised with it -- I mean, is that -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are -- again, the legislative components of this or tactics of it I will leave to -- or the President rather -- I will leave to the President and the leaders of Congress to work out, as long as we -- with the understanding, obviously, that we are pursuing the biggest deal possible, as well as ensuring that there is a fallback provision.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a two-step process here, that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get the debt ceiling raised and you\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing this big deal, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have to happen on the same day, right? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You mean that they don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have to happen as part of one bill?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One legislation, assuming --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I understand it, no, but there is a deadline of August 2nd for raising the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 And the dynamic that\'s created here that, for better or worse, and we think now for better, that has linked these two has focused attention and focused people\xe2\x80\x99s minds on the need to do something significant around deficit reduction as we deal with what is, while not always pleasant, a very routine thing that Congress has done every couple of years for as long as you and I have been in Washington, which is raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 So we think that this is a unique opportunity, and we ought to seize it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned actually if somehow Gang of Six is used sort of -- gets some -- enough senators, folks excited that this could get done, it gets debt ceiling raised, and then everybody backs off?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that if -- these are hypotheticals, so I -- but we are committed to trying to get a big deal done.\xc2\xa0 We have laid down some of the markers, the President has, about what he will or won\xe2\x80\x99t do in terms of raising the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 We recognize the McConnell proposal as a potential fallback option -- not a preferred option, but a fallback option -- simply to get that done.\xc2\xa0 And then whether things are attached to it or run parallel to it, these are all things that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure are being studied by the leadership and the staff.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While I know you\'re not endorsing I guess all components of Gang of Six, is it fair to say he\xe2\x80\x99s more supportive of this Gang of Six proposal that he was Bowles-Simpson?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I would simply say that he\xe2\x80\x99s supportive of the approach taken by both.\xc2\xa0 And what is significant about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s more -- he\xe2\x80\x99s been more enthusiastic about Gang of Six than Bowles-Simpson -- \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We made clear at the time that the President agreed with many of the proposals put forward by Simpson-Bowles, disagreed with some.\xc2\xa0 We embraced some of the proposals in his -- in the President\xe2\x80\x99s own legislative proposals, the ones that have emanated from Simpson-Bowles, including corporate tax reform, allowing the 2001 and 2003 high-income and estate tax cuts expire, fully paying for the alternative minimum tax patch for three years, strengthening Social Security for the future.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\'s are all elements that were part of Simpson-Bowles that the President endorsed right away and at the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no difference?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of enthusiasm?\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re at different -- we\xe2\x80\x99re in a different period now in terms of where we are legislatively.\xc2\xa0 And the introduction by the Gang of Six of a concrete proposal put forward by six members of the Senate -- three Republicans, three Democrats, representing a broad ideological spectrum in American politics -- I think is a welcome development.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned that a majority of the Democratic leaders he\xe2\x80\x99s going to meet with are going to be against these entitlement reforms that he is putting on the table?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has made clear when he\xe2\x80\x99s come, as he has frequently, to speak with you here that he understands he has a responsibility and a challenge in persuading Democrats that they need to join him in making tough choices in the name of a broad, balanced approach to deficit reduction; that some of the measures he is willing to consider in terms of entitlement reform will strengthen those programs; and that in the name of a broader goal here, we need to make some tough choices and that includes setting aside entitlements.\xc2\xa0 That includes some very tough choices in domestic discretionary spending. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the President has made clear, and he did during the CR, there are cuts that are going to be required in discretionary spending that he would not otherwise want to make, and he understands that Democrats would not otherwise want to make.\xc2\xa0 There are some programs out there that are going to be trimmed, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a deal, or cut significantly that have merit.\xc2\xa0 But in a time when we\xe2\x80\x99re tightening our belts and we need to get our fiscal house in order, the standards are very high for what qualifies as absolutely necessary spending.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in order to allow the government to have the capacity to make the kind of necessary -- absolutely necessary investments in education, technology, innovation, infrastructure, you need to cut back as much as you can in the areas where you can.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carol.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to clarify, are you saying that the President would sign a temporary debt ceiling increase if it was to allow the legislative process a little bit more time to get a deal that leaders have already agreed to?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that the President will not sign just a temporary measure that requires a repetitive process where we cast doubt on the capacity of Washington to deal with raising its debt ceiling, cast doubt on whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s going to honor its obligations in a repetitive way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I will say, to be clear, is that we believe a short-term extension absent an agreement to a larger deal is unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, if both sides agree to something significant, we will support the measures needed to finalize details.\xc2\xa0 But as you saw Jack Lew say over the weekend, there is something -- there is still time to get something big done, and members of both parties and the American people agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we continue to press for getting a big deal.\xc2\xa0 We believe that there is time to get it done.\xc2\xa0 And the answer to your question is that if both sides agree to something concretely significant, we will support the measures needed to finalize the details.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sort of like what he did with the shutdown, the CR?\xc2\xa0 They agreed to a deal, it was a temporary thing. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, rather than make an analogy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just stick with the language I used.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then, so the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting today and these other meetings and discussions that he\xe2\x80\x99s having are to figure out, as you said, which train is going to leave the station and whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal, or a little deal or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, the trains -- several trains have left the station.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a decision about which train we\xe2\x80\x99ll be riding when we get to the next station.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- like baseball.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will they be serving turkey and peas on the train?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jell-o?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jell-O and peas.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Layer cake. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many stops are they trying to take?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Too many stops on the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that -- wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his goal to decide on Friday and then to decide by Saturday which horse they were going to ride, trains **leaving the station --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What the President said on Friday is that we need to understand what people\xe2\x80\x99s bottom lines are.\xc2\xa0 And we have been in basically a non-stop process of having conversations, negotiations, meetings to find out what -- I think Jake was talking about it -- this is -- the way that Congress works is not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s just not that simple.\xc2\xa0 And we have to not just come up with proposals that everybody in the room likes, but proposals that we can be confident will garner majorities in both houses. And that includes both a possible bigger deal, a mid-size deal and the fallback measure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, that Senator McConnell and Senator Reid are working on.\xc2\xa0 So those are the conversations that we\xe2\x80\x99re having and continue to have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So at what point do you -- does the President believe that you guys have to settle on -- zero in on one train?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that in terms of what point we have to -- the process of legislating has to be engaged in order to ensure on the debt ceiling issue we get it done, I would point you to Capitol Hill, since they know much better than I and they know even better than anyone here how much time they need to make that happen.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously working with them to ensure that, at the very least, we have a train to ride that gets to the station by August 2nd with legislation that allows for the debt ceiling to be raised.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you guys think that we could go up to August 1st?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just said by August 2nd.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the deadline.\xc2\xa0 If you say by August 1st for something to be ready to be signed, that\xe2\x80\x99s a long -- that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you start -- you make the decision on August 1st of what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do because you have to back up from there because you have to pass bills through both houses of Congress, potentially reconcile them. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a deadline for when that process starts, and it could be that there are two vehicles that are still being put forward maybe legislatively, even beyond that window as long as we know that the failsafe measure is moving along and has the support necessary to ensure that the debt ceiling gets raised.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, just lastly, a procedural matter.\xc2\xa0 Has Treasury and OMB decided which payments to prioritize?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, was the phone call to Speaker Boehner last evening after the vote on cut, cap and balance?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you read out that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No readouts, especially of phone calls, to all four.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President of the opinion the House wasted its time yesterday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President spoke to this yesterday when he said he recognized what they were doing and perhaps the need for doing it, but that it was time to move past symbolic votes and -- because the clock is ticking and we need to get something done that can be supported by both houses and the President.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that measure does not have the support necessary to become law and everyone is aware of that.\xc2\xa0 So we need to move on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it look to you as though any measure has the support to become law?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I think a lot of members of Congress and members of this administration are working on now to ensure that there are measures that emerge from this process that can become law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in the House it\xe2\x80\x99s all about getting 218 votes.\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering, what is the White House doing --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d take more than 218 if we could get them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 What are you doing to get those 218 votes, at least on the Republican side?\xc2\xa0 Or is that maybe up for discussion this afternoon?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing has been pretty clear.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of public activity to argue the merits of, A, why there is no alternative to making sure the United States has the capacity to pay its bills; B, that we should be pushing for a broad, bipartisan, balanced deficit reduction bill that allows us to put our fiscal house in order and sends the right signals to the economy, that allows the economy to grow and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, we obviously have a lot of people who work with and pay attention to Congress, but in the end, it\xe2\x80\x99s members of Congress who have to vote, and their leaders who will take their temperature and measure the support that may or may not be there for different proposals that are put forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When do you think you have Mr. Boehner down?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make on other meetings right now.\xc2\xa0 We have the meeting scheduled for 2:50 p.m. today with House and Senate Democratic leaders.\xc2\xa0 But I would remind you he spoke with the Speaker just last night, as well as the Senate Minority Leader.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another topic -- the trade package.\xc2\xa0 That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been sent up yet, as far as I know.\xc2\xa0 Are you -- is the White House still going to send the package up yet -- I mean, through August, or do you think it might be slipping towards September?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you.\xc2\xa0 We still firmly believe that it is time to move forward with these agreements and with TAA and get it done now, because these agreements have broad bipartisan support and there is broad recognition that they will support -- either create or support up to 70,000 American jobs.\xc2\xa0 So we ought to move quickly on them.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update on the legislative minutiae of how that process is going to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify the point you\xe2\x80\x99re making, the point that you have written down there about the short-term extension absent a significant agreement is not acceptable -- I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to be really precise about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You want me to try synonyms maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I just want to make sure I understand.\xc2\xa0 When you say a short-term extension absent something more significant, are you talking about the McConnell fallback?\xc2\xa0 Because that\xe2\x80\x99s short term; those are three chunks. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I have addressed -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if you were here.\xc2\xa0 There is a significant difference.\xc2\xa0 What the McConnell bill does is allow for the extension of the debt ceiling into 2013.\xc2\xa0 That is obviously what the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t consider that short term.\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- has insisted be done.\xc2\xa0 There are some mechanisms for political cover that allow -- require votes that will be foregone conclusions.\xc2\xa0 But the debt ceiling -- it will -- because the whole point about extending the debt ceiling for a relatively significant amount of time is to create the kind of certainty that we need to ensure that the domestic and global economy understands that we\xe2\x80\x99re functioning appropriately.\xc2\xa0 So the McConnell provision extends the debt ceiling into 2013.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even though you have the three separate chunks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct, but those are designed in a way that makes them a foregone conclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But what is your thinking about what pieces of the Gang of Six could be attached to some kind of a short-term deal that would make it acceptable?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how does that work? If you can\xe2\x80\x99t -- you can\xe2\x80\x99t just draft the whole thing onto it, because it takes time to get this done. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me remind you that the Gang of Six is an entrant -- an important entrant into the field here of proposals that broadly mirror what is a growing consensus and mirror what the President supports, which is taking a balanced approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Vice President, in the negotiations he led -- I mean, there has already been -- there is a lot of road that has been traveled already in terms of identifying acceptable discretionary cuts.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of road that has already been traveled in terms of identifying cuts that can still be negotiated in defense discretionary spending, in savings that can be gleaned from entitlement reform, and obviously savings that can be garnered dealing with the tax code and ending loopholes and other measures that we can take, and also then broadly dealing with tax reform.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it is not a question of Gang of Six, whole or in part, being grafted onto something.\xc2\xa0 There are -- we know what these proposals look like.\xc2\xa0 And there could be good ideas within the Gang of Six proposal that can be incorporated into the stuff that has already been negotiated between Democrats and Republicans in the administration and that could build -- I mean, we have talked about for a long time now the building blocks and what we need to -- what needs to be done to get us beyond, say, $1.5 trillion up to $1.7 trillion, up to $2.4 trillion, into the threes and beyond.\xc2\xa0 Every participant in the negotiations that were held here is aware of what is required to get there and the compromises and tough choices that need to be made to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the Gang of Six will be another example with some explicit ideas about how you do that and really you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at a menu of options.\xc2\xa0 And if there is the political will to do this in a balanced way, we believe it can be done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the question about both sides\xe2\x80\x99 bottom lines, which the President has been asking them to tell him -- today, when he meets with Democrats, one of their bottom lines all along has been no cuts in Medicare benefits.\xc2\xa0 They said they would be willing to do something to the programs.\xc2\xa0 And the President is fond of pointing to polls that show that his balanced approach is very popular.\xc2\xa0 One thing that\xe2\x80\x99s not popular is any changes in benefits to either Social Security or Medicare, which he\xe2\x80\x99s discussed with the Speaker, that\xe2\x80\x99s in the Gang of Six, that that\xe2\x80\x99s a constant in this -- either raising the eligibility --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would make two points.\xc2\xa0 One, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate the details that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to negotiate with you.\xc2\xa0 And then secondly -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s even if we are able to achieve something significant that would have as a component of it entitlement reform; B, I think the President has also been very clear in stating that if we go in this direction, it requires some hard choices.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he could have been more clear about that.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the discussion that needs to be had.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you have a sense yet of the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 bottom line?\xc2\xa0 Because this -- Gang of Six requires $1.7 trillion in net revenue increases, and that seems to violate one of their bottom lines.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think there was a lot of positive response to what the Gang of Six put forward.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re talking -- you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about this again as if this is the only way to get a grand bargain, if you will, is in every element and detail of what the Gang of Six put forward.\xc2\xa0 I remind you that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- talking about the net $1 trillion then.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you said in that $1.7 trillion, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that there are -- well, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect example of what would remain to be negotiated about how you get revenue and how much revenue, which affects, obviously, the size of the package.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s for them to negotiate.\xc2\xa0 If there is the will and the decision made that we should go there, we should try to get the biggest possible deficit reduction package because that\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing for the economy, it\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people want, it\xe2\x80\x99s what the Republicans want, it\xe2\x80\x99s what the Democrats want, it\xe2\x80\x99s what the independents want, it\xe2\x80\x99s what you and I want -- well, at least it\xe2\x80\x99s what I want.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 David.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was reported last week that the President told Majority Leader Cantor that he would be willing to take this debate to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And today, in an ABC/Washington Post poll, it found that six out of 10 Americans did not think the President was doing enough to reach across the aisle to find a compromise here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, regardless of what the poll found about views on Republicans, doesn\'t that show that the President is losing this debate as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would -- I certainly disagree with the assessment that he\xe2\x80\x99s losing this debate.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelming evidence that the American people prefer a pragmatic, balanced, bipartisan and significant deficit reduction package.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President made clear when he\xe2\x80\x99s come out and spoken to you all here that the choices that would be involved in creating such a grand bargain would need to be explained and sold to Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And he has -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President spend a lot of time discussing his views on this in public because he understands that this is complex and arcane stuff in many ways, especially when you throw in phrases like \xe2\x80\x9craise the debt ceiling,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it needs -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that he does his job to help explain to the American people what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Washington and why he\xe2\x80\x99s taking the positions he\xe2\x80\x99s taking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he feels that that is absolutely his responsibility, and he takes it seriously.\xc2\xa0 He believes that there is growing evidence that the American people broadly support the approach that he\xe2\x80\x99s taking, and thinks that that fact, coupled with increasing willingness by members of both parties on Capitol Hill to think big and to think about this in terms of a balanced bipartisan deal, is encouraging.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I just follow up?\xc2\xa0 I think the poll also found that his approval rating was at 47 percent, which is one of the lowest that this particular poll has found since he\xe2\x80\x99s taken office.\xc2\xa0 Does that show that this is dragging the President down as well? I mean this whole debate --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I honestly can tell you that this is about making hard choices that are the right choices to ensure that the American economy is where it needs to be.\xc2\xa0 And, I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that even though the economy has been growing now for some time, even though we\xe2\x80\x99ve created more than 2.1 million private sector jobs over the last however many months, we are nowhere near close to where we need to be, and that the anxiety that that creates is real and justifiable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this President is totally focused on making sure that he does everything he can to ensure that every American who is looking for a job can get a job.\xc2\xa0 And he will not rest until we get to that point.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\'s the way he looks at it -- not in terms of what his job approval rating is.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Helene.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given, though, that these polls are showing that so many Americans seem pretty fed up with the whole process, is the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Understandably.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President -- he, yesterday, to be pretty -- he seemed optimistic yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Behind closed doors, though, is he showing any frustration?\xc2\xa0 Is he fed up with this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think to the extent that we had some questions about this with regard to one of the meetings last week -- I mean, to the extent that the President is ever frustrated, he\xe2\x80\x99s frustrated, or has been, when he sees the potential for something historic to be achieved that\'s right there and everybody understands what it would take, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not that hard -- because the beauty of a balanced approach is that it doesn\'t require draconian sacrifices by either party.\xc2\xa0 It just requires a willingness to be reasonable.\xc2\xa0 And his frustration with the way the process works sometimes is when he sees that possibility right there and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see everybody reaching to grab it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 His optimism, which is perpetual, is that he has great faith in the American people to understand what\xe2\x80\x99s happening and to send -- to convey to their elected officials what they think ought to be done.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s seeing that now.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some movement in Congress in terms of an appreciation and understanding about what we believe broadly the American people expect their leaders in Washington to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think some of the reporting about -- one of the times when he expressed that frustration is when he said, look, some of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here is exactly why people get frustrated with Washington; it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why Americans get fed up -- to use your words.\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to show the opposite; to show that leaders can lead, that the folks -- I mean, the people who are sent to Congress are the leaders of their communities.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re the ones that were chosen through the ballot box to work for them in Washington to get things done.\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a huge opportunity to do that if the political will exists.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the risk of belaboring the train analogy, I know you said you wanted to be pushing on the various different tracks.\xc2\xa0 You want the push on the Gang of Six --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can say with absolute confidence that none of the trains is a high-speed train in this.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No high-speed rail here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not in the budget --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 These are slow-moving trains.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the danger that if you decide that, at least for now, you need to go to plan B, you need to get something in place to eliminate -- to get past the absolute deadline of August 2nd, that that will inevitably result in the derailing of the grand bargain train because there is no more forcing event?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that would be a shame.\xc2\xa0 But let me be clear that the United States Congress will take the measures necessary to ensure that we can continue to honor our obligations and pay our bills after August 2nd.\xc2\xa0 We are absolutely confident of that.\xc2\xa0 Leaders of Congress have expressed the same confidence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We believe that we can get more than that, something much more significant than that within the time frame.\xc2\xa0 If we do not, we are going to continue to fight for that, because we have to deal with our deficits, we have to deal with our debt, and we have to do it in a balanced way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We do believe a unique opportunity has been created here that allows for action to be taken all at once, if you will, for Congress to make some very important, hard votes that will, we believe, end up paying off for the economy, for the American people.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep fighting.\xc2\xa0 I mean, no matter how grand the bargain, if we achieve one, there will still be work to be done.\xc2\xa0 There will still be work to be done to create jobs, to grow the economy.\xc2\xa0 And that will continue on August 3rd and for the rest of the time that this President is in office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Christi, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you, and then I apologize that I spent probably a little too much time on the front two rows, and I will remedy that next time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Christi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not to belabor this point, but when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking short-term measures to finalize the details, are you talking hours or days, a week?\xc2\xa0 Are we potentially talking about weeks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to go beyond the language.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, do you want to go beyond the language on what constitutes significant?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is it a trillion dollars in cuts.\xc2\xa0 Does that count as significant?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
