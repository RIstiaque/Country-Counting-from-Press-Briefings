EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How is everything?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the President\'s take on McChrystal\'s report that he needs more troops or they\'re going to fail in Afghanistan?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President obviously has seen General McChrystal\'s report and has had a chance to look at it and is in the process of, with his national security team and those at the Pentagon, working through some of the strategic assessments that the President thinks need to be evaluated.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he seen this confidence report that was reported in The Washington Post today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\'s the -- I think it\'s on the Web and I think it\'s a redacted -- as best I know, it\'s a redacted version of the report that was -- that Secretary Gates gave to the President several weeks ago, or before he went to Martha\'s Vineyard.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But I\'d stress what the President said over the weekend -- going through the history of our involvement there over the past nearly eight years, the President, upon coming into office, wanted an assessment on where we were and how best to move forward.\xc2\xa0 Additional troops were okayed in the buildup to ensure security before the election, and the President asked then in the announcement of those additional resources in March that we come back after the election and assess where we are.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">That is the process that\'s ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And I think, as the President reiterated several times this weekend during his interviews, is we\'re going to have -- we\'re going to conduct that strategic assessment and do that in a way that lays out the best path forward before we make resource decisions, rather than having this go the other way around where one makes resources decisions and then finds a strategy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what we\'re doing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that point, though, doesn\'t it have impact when the NATO U.S. commander says, among other things, we need more resources?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, obviously the commander has a specific mission in mind for which he sees -- he may see additional resources.\xc2\xa0 Again, no resource request has come and I don\'t anticipate that it will come for a little bit because there\'s an assessment that\'s ongoing about where we are right now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is one of the possible reassessments a dramatic pullback in the mission that would change the mission from the comprehensive one that we now have to something much less, more targeted on just the leaders of al Qaeda?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is going to focus on getting the strategy right, and I\'m not going to go through what options he may or may not have.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has received this report in which McChrystal is asking for -- saying he needs more troops.\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying no request has come.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No specific -- as we\'ve talked about only about three dozen times in the briefing room, this is an assessment and from that assessment will come, as I understand it, in several weeks options for additional resources.\xc2\xa0 So a specific request for additional resources is what\'s to follow.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a different topic, did the President order word to Governor Paterson that he does not want him to seek reelection?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think everybody understands the tough jobs that every elected official has right now in addressing many of the problems that we have, and I think people are aware of the tough situation that the governor of New York is in.\xc2\xa0 And I wouldn\'t add a lot to what you\'ve read, except this is a decision that he\'s going to make.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you can\'t say for the record whether the President has directed word to the governor saying, I don\'t want you to seek reelection?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President understands the tough job that everyone has and the pressure that they\'re under.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a broader question on that?\xc2\xa0 The White House seems very involved in a lot of local races, maybe more so than usual.\xc2\xa0 Do you get the sense that President Obama is more eager to participate in state electoral politics than --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would somewhat not subscribe to the notion that this is new.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Pardon?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t subscribe to the notion that this is -- that the White House being involved in politics is -- it\'s a little -- to quote Paul Begala, not to be involved in politics would be like taking the math out of physics.\xc2\xa0 You and I could do it, if that were the case.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any risks for the President in dabbling in various states?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The hazards of the job.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any funny anecdotes for David Letterman tonight?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to preview them here, for goodness sakes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, so we can get ready.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So that you can get ready?\xc2\xa0 Well, that was first and foremost on the President\'s mind this morning.</div> <div class="legacy-para">No, he\'s had a good rapport with David Letterman for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 We did this before he became a senator and again on the presidential campaign, so it should be -- I think it will be fun.\xc2\xa0 But I also think, again, I think it\'s a way of talking to people that may not get their news all from traditional outlets. So I think that\'s an important way to continue the conversation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Considering the obstacles that he faces -- or faced in the quest for Middle East peace, what kind of result is the President looking at for these three-way talks with Abbas and Netanyahu?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, we\'re looking to continue to build on progress.\xc2\xa0 I think part of that progress is getting the three parties, including the United States, together.\xc2\xa0 And we have no grand expectations out of one meeting except to continue, as the President talked about from his very first day in office, continue the hard work, day-to-day diplomacy that has to be done to seek a lasting peace.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Do you have something else?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I was actually going to ask that very same question.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Anything else?\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  10:42 A.M.
