EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. BEDINGFIELD: \xc2\xa0Hi, good morning. \xc2\xa0Thanks, everybody, for taking the time to join us. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJust as a reminder, this call is on background, attributable to senior administration officials. \xc2\xa0So with that, I will turn it over to my colleague to get started.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Hi, everybody. \xc2\xa0Thanks for being on the call with us. \xc2\xa0Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to give you kind of the wave tops of the trip and leave as much time for question and answer as we can.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we depart on Sunday. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll travel all day Sunday. \xc2\xa0We arrive in Kyiv late in the evening on Sunday, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll overnight to start our meetings on Monday. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are basically three major meetings on Monday. \xc2\xa0One will be a roundtable with reformers, which will be kind of a group of civil society activists and some other officials and others who have been very involved in the reform. \xc2\xa0We will then have two major bilateral meetings. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a long working lunch and bilateral session between the Vice President and President Poroshenko. \xc2\xa0And in the evening, the Vice President will sit down for a long bilateral with Prime Minister Yatsenyuk.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMy understanding is Prime Minister Yatsenyuk is traveling earlier in the day, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll be back later on Monday and have an opportunity to have a lengthy conversation with the Vice President in the evening on Monday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ll then stay overnight on Monday night, and on Tuesday, the Vice President will give remarks to the Rada. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99ll give an address to the Rada. \xc2\xa0The Rada is the Ukrainian legislature. \xc2\xa0At least as far as our research could turn up, we don\'t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s any other historical precedent for a foreign official giving a speech like this. \xc2\xa0So we believe this is a historic opportunity for the Vice President to really lay out our policy on Ukraine. \xc2\xa0And as many of you on the call undoubtedly know, we\'re now about two years past the beginning of the Maidan uprising, which really set -- the events that frame this trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSpeaking of which, let me just go over a few of basically the topline themes and messages for our visit. \xc2\xa0I think in the first instance, the Vice President aims to provide a strong signal of our support for Ukraine in the face of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s continued military intervention and support for separatism in the Donbass. \xc2\xa0While violence has decreased somewhat in recent months, compared to what it\xe2\x80\x99s been like over the last couple of years, it\xe2\x80\x99s still fairly violent along the line of contact. \xc2\xa0And the separatists and their Russian backers are not -- the obligation under the Minks Agreements to calm that conflict down. \xc2\xa0And we can go into that in more detail if you\'re interested.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Vice President will also underscore that we categorically opposed and continue to oppose Russia\xe2\x80\x99s attempted annexation of Crimea. \xc2\xa0The Vice President will discuss what additional economic, governance, and rule of law reforms are necessary with Ukraine -- the Prime Minister and the President. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s economic and humanitarian needs. \xc2\xa0This is something that we\'re very focused on, especially as we head into the winter, where some Ukrainians will be increasingly vulnerable to bad weather.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Vice President will emphasize the need to implement recently passed anti-corruption reforms. \xc2\xa0Ukraine has made significant strides in this regard, but there is a long history of corruption and of basically Ukraine oligarchs getting their way in the Ukrainian system. \xc2\xa0And while the Ukrainians have made good strides, there is still much more that needs to be done. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll -- undoubtedly that will be a major focus of conversation. \xc2\xa0The Vice President will discuss more broadly the implementation of the Minsk Agreements, which are meant to de-escalate hostilities between the Russian-backed separatists and the Ukrainian government. \xc2\xa0And in particular, the Vice President will emphasize the need for Russia and the separatists to live up to their obligations under the Minsk Agreements where they have fallen short.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Vice President will discuss the broader diplomatic strategy to keep sanctions on Russia until Minsk is fully implemented, including the conversations we continue to have with our European allies on that support. \xc2\xa0And last but not least, the Vice President will discuss continued U.S.-led training efforts to train the Ukrainian armed forces and our overall security assistance to Ukraine to make sure that they can continue to defend themselves in the face of aggression in the east.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that kind of overview of the trip, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to you all. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hi, I\xe2\x80\x99m a Russian reporter here in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0Thank you for doing the call, sir. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd my question is about the Ukrainian debt to Russia. \xc2\xa0As you certainly know the Russians have offered a solution that requires an American or a European or an IMF guarantee of repayment in installments. \xc2\xa0So how do you view that? \xc2\xa0Does it look feasible to you? \xc2\xa0If not, why not? \xc2\xa0Thank you.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0So this is a bilateral matter between Russia and Ukraine. \xc2\xa0And we have very much supported the Ukrainian debt restructuring agreement that was reached through five months of negotiations by Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko. \xc2\xa0We think that is a very successful outcome for Ukraine, which will delay its debt burden and allow it to continue with its IMF program. \xc2\xa0But with regards to the Russian bond, that is a matter for Ukraine and Russia to work out bilaterally.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, to make sure, the U.S. does not contemplate giving any guarantees to support the payment, and would not encourage a private bank to do the same?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0I think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave my comments to let them stand as they are. \xc2\xa0This is a bilateral issue for Russia and Ukraine.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hey, I wanted you to talk a little bit more -- I missed the very top of the call, so if you addressed this, I have to apologize. \xc2\xa0But if we could talk a little bit more about how this fits in with what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with Syria. \xc2\xa0This strategy of isolating Putin and Russia over Ukraine is obviously complicated by this. \xc2\xa0President Obama avoided meeting with Putin for more than a year because of Ukraine, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s met with him three times in the last couple months. \xc2\xa0How do we square this circle? \xc2\xa0And what\xe2\x80\x99s the message to Poroshenko and Yatsenyuk going to be about any understandable concerns they might have about their situation being complicated because of the Syria situation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. \xc2\xa0Look, I think over the last several years, frankly, as our relationship with Russia has gone through very different phases, one thing has remained constant, which is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to stick up for our national interests. \xc2\xa0And in this context, we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to cooperate or have discussions with the Russians in areas where our two countries have convergent interests. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so we worked very closely with Moscow in pursuing the Iran nuclear agreement, for example. \xc2\xa0Before that agreement, we coordinated with Moscow on the Syrian chemical weapons agreement. \xc2\xa0Before that, we obviously had cooperation with them on Afghanistan -- resupply to Afghanistan; on the New START agreement, et cetera.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve shown is that we\xe2\x80\x99re open to cooperating with the Russians where their behavior comports with international norms and where their interests converge with ours. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe situation in Syria is obviously extraordinarily complex and has increased in complexity as a consequence of the Russian intervention. \xc2\xa0I think that we are not cooperating with the Russians on Syria so much as continue to have a conversation about whether cooperation on a path forward, especially on a political transition, is even possible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut one of the things we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear to the Russians from the get-go, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made this equally clear to all of our friends in Europe and to the Ukrainians, is that our dialogue with Russia on Syria and Assad is completely compartmented from the Ukraine experience. \xc2\xa0Nothing in our conversations with Syria impact our assessment that Russia continues to be the aggressor in Ukraine; that they continue to violate their obligations under the Minsk Agreement; that they continue to encourage the separatists, or at least not prevent the separatists from also violating their obligations under the Minsk Agreement. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so, actually, one of the major goals of the trip is to remind the Ukrainian people and the world, frankly, that even as so much of the international attention has shifted towards Russia\xe2\x80\x99s involvement with Syria, and our interactions with Russia as it relates to Syria, that we, the United States, haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten about Ukraine; that Ukraine remains central to our national interests; and that the Vice President and President continue to believe that progress in Ukraine is essential for the ultimate aspiration we have for Europe of being whole, at peace, and free. \xc2\xa0So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a major theme of the trip -- that nothing that\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the Middle East has changed one iota of our commitment to the Ukrainian people and to their security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hi, just kind of a follow-up to Peter\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xc2\xa0I was wondering if you think the events in Syria have made the Europeans slightly squishy with regards to linkage between Minsk and lifting sanctions. \xc2\xa0And also I was wondering if you think that that linkage between Minsk and the sanctions risks sending a message to Moscow that Crimea -- the annexation of Crimea is okay?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that under no circumstances is the annexation of Crimea okay. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been consistent on that from the get-go. \xc2\xa0As it relates to the issue of -- and by the way, I should say there are certain sanctions that are attached specifically to Crimea that would not come off unless Russia ends its annexation of Crimea. \xc2\xa0So they\xe2\x80\x99re not linked in the sense that once Minsk gets complied with, every single sanction that\xe2\x80\x99s been put on Russia would automatically fall away. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear with the Russians on that and clear with the Europeans.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to the first part of your question, which is whether the Russian actions in Syria have at all kind of put a wedge or undermined the unity of the transatlantic community as it relates to sanctions, the answer is no -- although I suspect that Putin hoped that they would.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn other words, I think part of our assessment is that Putin intervened in Syria for a whole host of reasons but among them was to increase Russia\xe2\x80\x99s leverage over a conflict that obviously has enormous implications for Europe, given the refugee issues, given the terrorism concern, et cetera. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s conceivable that the Kremlin believes that in intervening in Syria they actually could generate chits that they could trade off between Syria and Ukraine -- the Europeans. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut if that was the goal, there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence that it\xe2\x80\x99s having any of that effect. \xc2\xa0The President and the Vice President have met repeatedly with top heads of state in Europe, whether it be Hollande or Merkel or, most recently, in Rome, the Vice President sat down with the Italian Prime Minister, Renzi. \xc2\xa0And in all of these conversations, our European allies who are so central to the sanctions have made clear that until Russia complies with its obligations under Minsk and gets the separatists to do the same, that these sanctions are not going to come off.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d just add to that that we have this in writing, as well. \xc2\xa0The last time that EU foreign ministers met, the Foreign Affairs Council\xe2\x80\x99s met on Ukraine, they specifically and explicitly stated that sanctions will be tied to full-on implementation of the Minsk Agreement. \xc2\xa0So I think that our European allies and partners are in the same place on this that we are, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got that -- as I said -- explicitly in writing, so we\xe2\x80\x99re in a good place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Two questions. \xc2\xa0There was some discussion about the recent National Defense Authorization Act, which earmarked $300 million for aid to Ukraine and $50 million for lethal weaponry and the like. \xc2\xa0The White House has made clear that there is still no change, that lethal weaponry is not on the cards, is not in the offing. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is that the message that the Vice President will be giving to President Poroshenko and others?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the second question concerns the somewhat blunt statement by the U.S. ambassador in September about the Prosecutor General\xe2\x80\x99s Office and their ability or unwillingness to reform their anti-corruption bureau. \xc2\xa0And how hard is the Vice President going to be I guess hammering his Ukrainian colleagues on this matter? \xc2\xa0Are there concerns that the Prosecutor General\xe2\x80\x99s Office or the President\xe2\x80\x99s Office are not up to the task to really putting through bona fide anti-corruption statutes and reforms?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Well, thanks for that. \xc2\xa0Let me take those questions in reverse order and then ask my colleague to chime in a little bit on the NDAA thing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo as it relates to the Prosecutor General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, I think the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s message will be that it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to set up this special prosecutor for fighting corruption -- that the Office of the Prosecutor General itself is in desperate need of reform. \xc2\xa0And so he has made this very clear to President Poroshenko in previous conversations and -- reiterate that during this trip. \xc2\xa0So I think we are largely in line with Ambassador Pyatt\xe2\x80\x99s sense that much more needs to be done to reform the Prosecutor General\xe2\x80\x99s Office so that it actually enables anti-corruption efforts as opposed to standing in the way of those efforts. \xc2\xa0So that will be I think something that is talked about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to security assistance, let me just remind people on the call that separate from the NDAA, we have provided $450 million in direct assistance to the Ukrainians. \xc2\xa0More than half of that has been security assistance. \xc2\xa0And body armor, uniforms, Humvees and other vehicles, communication equipment, and also a great deal of training of the Ukrainian national guard and other forces in Ukraine -- that continues. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody should have the misimpression that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t provided substantial amounts of security assistance for Ukraine. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve also taken other actions alongside NATO in and around Ukraine to signal to Moscow that their aggression in the east is not something that will bully us away from our relationship with Ukraine or bully NATO and our partners elsewhere in Europe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates specifically to the NDAA earmarks, maybe I can ask my colleague to chime in a little bit -- on lethal side of this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Yes, well, as my colleague mentioned, we provided over $265 million in security assistance to Ukraine -- that has included everything from counter-artillery radars to night-vision goggles to Humvees, both armored and unarmored, all sorts of equipment. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how we\xe2\x80\x99ll end up spending the that it is in the NDAA. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a decision that will be made in the future. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut our view of the conflict overall has been that this is not one that will be solved militarily on the ground, and therefore we\xe2\x80\x99ve pursued a diplomatic solution to the Minsk process. \xc2\xa0And our pressure on Russia has primarily been in the form of economic sanctions. \xc2\xa0That is what we see as the most fruitful avenue for finding a resolution to the conflict.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, that said, obviously we recognize Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s need and our need, frankly, to help Ukraine defend itself against aggression in the Donbass. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have provided the security assistance that we have. \xc2\xa0And as my colleague mentioned, we\xe2\x80\x99ve engaged in a very robust training program for the Ukrainian national guard, which has now transitioned into a training program for Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s conventional armed forces, as well as their special forces.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we have taken things to a new level in terms of our security pursuits. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take a good look at how we spend the $300 million that has been authorized in the NDAA to provide comprehensive security assistance, but also defense reform for the Ukrainian armed forces, which, unfortunately, over the last two and a half decades have really been hollowed out through mismanagement and a lack of appropriate defense investments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0I think this last point is actually quite important for people to understand, which is that -- obviously, good people can disagree about any particular piece of equipment or the merits of it, but frankly, debating whether a particular piece of equipment that may or may not have been provided to Ukraine would be a game-changer in the current environment, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a hard argument to make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think what would make -- be a game-changer is a fundamental reform of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s security sector and improving the institutional quality and capabilities of their armed forces, which is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re aiming at. \xc2\xa0Because frankly, that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s going to allow Ukraine, over time, to resist the type of coercion Moscow has tried to impose upon it over the last two years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hi. \xc2\xa0Quickly, I just wanted to clear up what you were saying is unprecedented about his speech to the legislature. \xc2\xa0Is that unprecedented from a U.S. figurehead, from a Vice President? \xc2\xa0I just wondered if you could clear that up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then second, if you could talk about just the kind of softer side, the relationship between the Vice President and Poroshenko. \xc2\xa0That is that a lot of the calls that are coming from the White House are coming from the Vice President rather than the President and it seems that they\xe2\x80\x99ve built kind of rapport through this. \xc2\xa0And I wondered why Biden is used rather than President Obama in a lot of these talks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0Look, our research on this has not shown up any previous examples of a head of state addressing the Rada, certainly not a U.S. President or a Vice President. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s -- when I said unprecedented, that was my -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t rule out the possibility that our Google search was incomplete, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any evidence that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a certainly a leader of the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s stature -- the Rada.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think that this is really an opportunity, this speech on Tuesday, is really an opportunity for the Vice President to share some of his experiences. \xc2\xa0Remember, he spent more than three decades -- almost four decades -- in the U.S. Senate, which he sees as the best example of a legislature on planet Earth, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of his own experiences he wants to share with the Rada. \xc2\xa0And I think he will make the argument that even though he\xe2\x80\x99s on the phone all the time with President Poroshenko and with Prime Minister Yatsenyuk, that the legislators in the Rada also have a special obligation to keep Ukraine moving forward as it relates to their (inaudible). \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re really looking forward to that speech, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be great.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s personal relationship with both President Poroshenko and Prime Minister Yatsenyuk, I think a couple things are worth getting (inaudible). \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFirst, President Obama has also spoken to President Poroshenko on numerous occasions, both on the phone and in person. \xc2\xa0So we really -- this is a team effort. \xc2\xa0But this is one of those areas -- Ukraine -- where the President of the United States has asked the Vice President to play an especially prominent role. \xc2\xa0It\'s not the only place where that\'s the case. \xc2\xa0Iraq is another example of that, Central America -- there are a number of other instances. \xc2\xa0But from the very beginning of the Maidan uprising and its aftermath, as Ukraine struggled to form a new government and move forward on some very, very difficult reform efforts in the context of crippling economic challenges and military aggressions in the east, the President basically wanted his go-to guy, the Vice President, to keep tabs on this from the very beginning.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the Vice President, for those of you who heard him speak before, for the Vice President, he really believes all politics, especially in international affairs, is personal. \xc2\xa0And so when he is tasked by the President to focus on an area, he goes out of way to make sure that he has a close personal relationship with the leaders involved. \xc2\xa0And I think this goes back to the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s experience in the Senate and just the kind of person he is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo he has invested a lot in his relationships with both President Poroshenko and Prime Minister Yatsenyuk. \xc2\xa0And I think it\'s paid dividends in the sense that there is established open lines of communication, a degree of candor and trust that allows him to have conversations with them where there\xe2\x80\x99s no illusions about where we stand, what our expectations are and also understanding that the other side can come to us when they need help.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0And I would just add to that, the Vice President has a long history in Ukraine. \xc2\xa0One of his first foreign trips, in fact, as Vice President was to Ukraine. \xc2\xa0And even before the Maidan revolution of Dignity, the Vice President had over a dozen phone calls with former President Yanukovych trying to get him to play a more inclusive role with civil society and walk back from some of the violent actions that unfortunately transpired on Maidan. \xc2\xa0So he was heavily engaged in trying to work with Yanukovych, to get Ukraine to play a role where it didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to choose necessarily between Russia and the European Union, but could satisfy the will of the Ukrainian people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo he has a long history in this region. \xc2\xa0And then, of course, after Yamukovych fled, he knew a lot of players in Ukraine, and so was very well poised to continue his relationships with the Prime Minister and President Poroshenko after his inauguration.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0And just for the record books, this will be the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s fourth trip to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Fifth, fifth in the administration.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0But fourth since the Maidan revolution.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hi, guys. \xc2\xa0Thank you for doing the call. \xc2\xa0I was hoping that you could just take us back a little bit more to the planning of the visit. \xc2\xa0Can you talk about when the meeting was scheduled and kind of why? \xc2\xa0Did it have anything to do with a desire to assure Ukraine that it\'s not a chit in the Syria puzzle? \xc2\xa0Or is the visit completely independent of Syria stuff and was just sort of like planned six months ago? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering should we expect an announcement of any specific new U.S. commitment? \xc2\xa0And can you walk us through the rest of the itinerary? \xc2\xa0So Biden is going to do the meeting with the civil society, the meeting with the President, the meeting with the Prime Minister, the speech, and then is that it, and he leaves?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then I got one more. \xc2\xa0Sorry. \xc2\xa0I know you addressed the U.S. position on the $3 billion debt, but I still don\'t really understand it other than the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s a bilateral issue. \xc2\xa0Does the U.S. think that Ukraine should have to pay this money? \xc2\xa0And is the U.S. privately discussing helping back Ukraine?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0So just in terms of the schedule, he will also have a chance to meet with the Mayor of Kyiv, Klitschko, toward the end of the visit on Tuesday, and then he gets back on the plane and comes home. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s a very short out-and-back trip. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to the timing, frankly, part of this was what fits for the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule. \xc2\xa0He had a very busy set of domestic commitments in the fall and we weren\xe2\x80\x99t traveling much internationally. \xc2\xa0In fact, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t traveled until last week when the Vice President was in the Balkans and Croatia and then in Rome. \xc2\xa0We hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been on the road in six or eight months. \xc2\xa0And so we\'re getting back on the international -- circuit I guess. \xc2\xa0And so the timing just made sense from a scheduling perspective. \xc2\xa0But I also think substantively we wanted -- I think it was important for us to be on the back end of local elections in Ukraine, which had timing implications. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I do think that -- while I don\'t think it drove the timing of the trip per se, it is a good time to do the trip because of the Syria issue; that -- the world, there was so much attention focused on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s activities in Syria that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s activities in Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t think that was the driving factor on the particular timing -- that had more to do with the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule. \xc2\xa0But it was I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a bonus of the trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to whether we\'re going to announce any more assistance, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of our announcements. \xc2\xa0But I think there will the press statements on Monday, and then the speech on Tuesday. \xc2\xa0So stay tuned for that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd frankly, as it relates to the $3 billion debt issue, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let my colleague\xe2\x80\x99s comments from earlier stand unless he wants to add. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0Yes, I mean the only other thing I would say on the $3 billion debt from Russia is that Russia has apparently made some proposals via the media. \xc2\xa0Our understanding is that the Ukrainian government has not received any concrete proposals from the Russian side. \xc2\xa0And so until they do, it is hard to say what the Ukrainian government\xe2\x80\x99s reaction would be, or how they should adjust to a Russian proposal in this area.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is something -- again, as I said, this is bilateral between Ukraine and Russia. \xc2\xa0But so far everything that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen has been floated via the press. \xc2\xa0And there has been no specific proposal put out, so this is for them to work out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. BEDINGFIELD: \xc2\xa0Thanks, everyone. \xc2\xa0We appreciate you taking the time to dial in.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t10:18 A.M.
