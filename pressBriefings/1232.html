(Local)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Can you all hear, more or less?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we are setting down in Afghanistan in about 40 minutes, if all goes well.\xc2\xa0 And this evening the Vice President will be meeting with General Petraeus and Ambassador Eikenberry.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be spending probably about an hour, a little more, with them, just to get a briefing from them in advance of tomorrow; get an update from them on the situation on the ground.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99ll be the evening\xe2\x80\x99s events.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTomorrow he starts -- the Vice President starts out with a meet-and-greet with Embassy personnel.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to thank the Embassy team for the incredibly hard work they do in very difficult conditions.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAfter that we go out to a training site for the Afghan National Security Forces, so he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to see firsthand the status of the training program, the work that General Caldwell and others are doing to help build the Afghan army, the Afghan police.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll helo out there.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ll come back, and then the Vice President will meet with President Karzai.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be having lunch with President Karzai.\xc2\xa0 I expect there will be a larger group meeting, including with Ambassador Eikenberry, General Petraeus, the team that\'s traveling with the Vice President, President Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s team.\xc2\xa0 And then I expect there will be also be some one-on-one time between the Vice President and President Karzai.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn the afternoon after the lunch and the meeting, we\xe2\x80\x99re heading out to a site to see the efforts we\xe2\x80\x99re making in a particular area, which we\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you about tomorrow, to do counter-insurgency, looking at the results of the program in a particular place.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd after that we\xe2\x80\x99ll fly back to Bagram Air Base.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President will get a series of briefings there from some of the leaders in the military operation.\xc2\xa0 In particular he\xe2\x80\x99ll be getting a briefing on the counter-terrorism program and the efforts we\xe2\x80\x99re making in that area.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that pretty much concludes what will be by then a very long day.\xc2\xa0 We overnight in Afghanistan, and we can tell you more about the following days at the end of tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 So let me leave it at that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ Can you tell us if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything in particular the Vice President hopes to accomplish on this visit?\xc2\xa0 Anything he might want to say to President Karzai?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the visit comes at an important time, as this is really a pivot point in our policy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve moved from the surge last year to the transition to Afghan lead that will be starting this year and concluding ultimately in 2014.\xc2\xa0 And so I think what he wants to do in the first instance is to assess the progress we\xe2\x80\x99re making toward transition.\xc2\xa0 And hence the different briefings that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be having and the different visits he\xe2\x80\x99ll be making.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith President Karzai, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re very much on the same page.\xc2\xa0 After Lisbon and after our review in December, we\xe2\x80\x99re in agreement, President Karzai is in agreement, the NATO and ISAF allies are in agreement that 2011 marks the beginning of the transition to Afghan lead, Afghan responsibility.\xc2\xa0 By 2014 the Afghans will be in the lead throughout the country, as President Karzai suggested.\xc2\xa0 And so this is a very good moment at which to assess the progress we\xe2\x80\x99re making toward starting the transition.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe work that remains to be done, the review, pointed out both the progress as well as some of the open issues that we need to work on.\xc2\xa0 And this is an opportunity for the Vice President to discuss all of that with President Karzai as well as our commitment to work out a long-term bilateral relationship between the United States and Afghanistan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ But 2014 is our goal to have all combat forces withdrawn?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 2014 is our goal, I think, as the President said, to have Afghans in the lead throughout the country in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The Afghans will be taking lead responsibility in every district and province of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the goal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ But we might -- we may have combat forces in Afghanistan in 2014?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on what we may or may not have in 2014 or beyond.\xc2\xa0 What we do know and what\'s agreed is that the Afghans will be in the lead throughout the country.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ What do you think -- when Karzai is out saying things like he did just a couple of days ago -- he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want foreigners meddling in the country, and, you know, rhetoric like that, what\'s your response to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that no one wants foreigners in their country, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- the whole point of what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is transitioning to Afghan lead and Afghan responsibility.\xc2\xa0 President Obama was very clear during the review.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not here to govern Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not here to nation-build.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not here to secure Afghanistan (inaudible).\xc2\xa0 Those are responsibilities that belong to the Afghans.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the only purpose of our mission now is to help put the Afghans in a position where they can fully assume the responsibilities of governing the country, of securing the country.\xc2\xa0 That\'s exactly what the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision is, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also President Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s vision, as I understand it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ Does the Vice President have any specific message for Karzai in his meetings?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll let the Vice President speak for himself tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be making a statement after the meeting with President Karzai, so any message he will have delivered --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ When did Karzai get a heads up that he was coming?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I think at some point last week.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t remember the exact date.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ At the Afghan training facility that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to visit, do you know approximately how many Afghans are currently being trained right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 At that exact facility we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get you the information.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get you that tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ Do you expect that there will be a reduction in forces this year -- U.S. forces?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 In terms of U.S. national forces, again the President has been very, very clear on this.\xc2\xa0 In July of 2011, we will begin a drawdown of U.S. forces.\xc2\xa0 The pace (inaudible) with that drawdown is conditions-based, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll see where we are in July.\xc2\xa0 But yes, there will be a drawdown of U.S. forces starting in July.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m confused.\xc2\xa0 I thought at Lisbon the agreement was among Afghanistan, NATO and the U.S. that the U.S. would pull out all its combat forces by 2014.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President has said we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be totally out of there.\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ Right, but as I understand the agreement, where things stand is that there is an agreement that by 2014 Afghans will assume lead responsibility for security throughout the country in every district, in every province, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 What ongoing role, if any, there will be for U.S. forces, for international security forces is to be determined.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ Will corruption be on -- is corruption on the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda for his discussions with President Karzai?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let him speak for himself tomorrow after the meeting with President Karzai.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ Thank you very much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Happy landing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t6:41 P.M.
