EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I actually want to start the gaggle off with a little good news.\xc2\xa0 I learned over the weekend that Mike Majchrowitz from FOX Radio will be returning to the White House beat on Monday.\xc2\xa0 So I won\'t be at the White House on Monday, but I hope all of those -- my colleagues at the White House and your colleagues at the White House will join me in welcoming Mike back to the White House beat.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Just a few quick stats for you guys.\xc2\xa0 The President has taken 16 trips to Nevada since 2009, eight trips this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, as we\'ve said many times, early vote is a key priority for us.\xc2\xa0 We\'re very focused on it.\xc2\xa0 It\'s game day across the country.\xc2\xa0 Early voting starts in Nevada on -- let\'s see -- October 6th.\xc2\xa0 The deadline for registration is October 20th.\xc2\xa0 So these days are -- oh, sorry -- flip it.\xc2\xa0 I was reading it wrong. Early voting starts October 20th; the deadline for registering is October 6th.\xc2\xa0 My apologies.</p>\n<p>So it\'s important for us to be spending time here.\xc2\xa0 While the President is here preparing for the debate on Wednesday, he also will be holding an event this evening to speak directly to the voters in the state, make the case for why he\'s a better choice for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And over the next few days -- you know he likes to spend some time out in the community -- so we could be making some local stops as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, is there any other details you can give us about why he picked Henderson for debate prep?\xc2\xa0 And also, can you give us any information about how he\'ll be spending his days when he\'s doing the prep?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Henderson, as you know, is a suburb of Las Vegas.\xc2\xa0 This is a key state for us and for our campaign as we pursue our goal of winning 270 electoral votes.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a place where we think the President\'s commitment to fighting for middle-class tax cuts, his commitment to remaining focused on improving the housing market -- which is such a key issue in Nevada -- he spent his weekly address on that.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a place where people care deeply about having someone in office who will fight for comprehensive immigration reform in the White House.</p>\n<p>He\'ll be talking about all these issues.\xc2\xa0 And it was an opportunity for us to spend some time in the state before early voting starts, as the voter registration deadline is approaching, and I expect he\'ll be doing that over the next couple of days.</p>\n<p>I\'m not going to preview for you our strategy of how we\'re handling debate prep, as I\'m sure comes as no surprise.\xc2\xa0 I have a sneaking suspicion that the Romney team may read into what we are saying these days about that.\xc2\xa0 I will say that the President and Mitt Romney clearly view the debates as a very different opportunity.\xc2\xa0 The President sees this as an opportunity to continue his conversation with the American people as he been doing over the last several months, including at the convention, which was probably our largest audience to date.\xc2\xa0 This will be a very large audience.\xc2\xa0 He wants to speak directly to the families -- the people who are on their couches at home, having snacks, drinking a beer, drinking soda, whatever it is, and tuning in for the first time -- and that\'s who he\'s speaking directly to.</p>\n<p>Mitt Romney and his team have been clear that this -- what they need and what they expect from the debates is a game-changing performance.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if you had the opportunity to watch Governor Christie this morning -- I know everybody was in transit -- but what he said is what they\'ve been saying for months, that they expect that after the debates this will -- this will turn the race upside down.\xc2\xa0 He also said the entire narrative will change.\xc2\xa0 And we fully expect that that\'s what they\'re focused on and that\'s what their focus is on as they prep.</p>\n<p>And the last thing I\'ll say is we also saw in reports that Mitt Romney and his team have been working on zingers and special lines for months.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what the President\'s focus is on.\xc2\xa0 So if you\'re expecting that, that\'s probably not what he\'s going to deliver on.\xc2\xa0 As I said, he\'s speaking directly to the American people and we know what they want to hear is what his plan is for moving the country forward, and that\'s what we\'re hoping he can deliver on, on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk to us a little bit -- I\'ll ask and you can not answer -- about timing in terms of -- is he trying to practice at night since the debate will be at night?\xc2\xa0 Is he trying to practice in short blocks or in sort of long blocks?\xc2\xa0 These are of course 15-minute segments.\xc2\xa0 Is he practicing in 15-minute segments?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that level of specificity.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the debate is in the evening, that is correct -- can confirm that.\xc2\xa0 He has had less time to prepare than we anticipated.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just a fact.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there have been events you all have been covering closely that have been going on the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s had a very active campaign schedule, as I can attest to and many of you can.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s also been focused on governing.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of things outside of campaigning and outside of dealing with the events in the Middle East he\xe2\x80\x99s been dealing with.</p>\n<p>So the time has been -- it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to schedule significant blocks of time when you\xe2\x80\x99re the President, regardless of your party.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been challenging.\xc2\xa0 We have been watching\xc2\xa0 -- our debate prep team has been watching debates back for years, both Romney\xe2\x80\x99s debates and debates that have happened between Republican and Democratic candidates.\xc2\xa0 We know that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- what the American are looking for is not just a professorial list of facts or accomplishments or even goals.\xc2\xa0 We know they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for your vision, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has been focused on.</p>\n<p>You touch on this a little bit, but for any of us who have been there, even with him over the last couple of weeks, and watched, say, the Univision debate, his interview with NBC for the Education Nation, he has a tendency to give longer, substantive answers.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just his nature.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something clearly we\xe2\x80\x99re working on.\xc2\xa0 And the format of the debate makes that a little bit more difficult.</p>\n<p>Romney has, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times, but has had more opportunities to debate over the last year, and he has used those opportunities to really bring in strong performances when it mattered during the primary season.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s been disciplined and been able to give short answers, so we know that\xe2\x80\x99s a strength.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Senator Kerry on the plane?</p>\n<p>MR. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe so, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we saw Gene Sperling and Jack Lew on the plane this morning.\xc2\xa0 Are they doing some debate prep right now with the President -- without getting into any details, are they starting in flight or are they waiting until they get there?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 They are on the plane.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read out through the next three days when we are and aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing debate prep.\xc2\xa0 Right now everyone is eating lunch and watching a little sports on TV, so I can tell you that much.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect Romney to try and expand the format of the debates and bring up Libya, for example?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to read out to you what the Romney team strategy is.\xc2\xa0 I have seen them say that they\xe2\x80\x99re watching out for the President to just spew lies during the debate.\xc2\xa0 So that is bordering on the complete bizarre, given that Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s team is the one who has said they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be dictated by facts.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the same candidate who has challenged whether the President understands America, understands freedom.\xc2\xa0 And they have driven months of their campaign through bold-faced lies, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on welfare, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on Medicare.\xc2\xa0 So we know his facts are inconvenient for him.\xc2\xa0 Maybe he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have taken those positions if they were so inconvenient.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s the piece I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them preview about their strategy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the first debate podium?\xc2\xa0 Are they at podiums, do you know?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Yes, they are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I transition to an Afghanistan question, Josh?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Jen.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There was another soldier killed, it sounds like, in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have a count -- is this the 2,000th?\xc2\xa0 And what is your reaction in general to that death?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, our reaction is the President and First Lady, their thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those who sacrifice so much for this country in Afghanistan, including those -- the families of those who\'ve paid the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>We saw the reports about the latest insider attack in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The military and our allies -- ISAF and our allies on the ground in Afghanistan have taken a number of steps to try to mitigate the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by insider attacks.\xc2\xa0 This includes greater vetting of Afghan forces.\xc2\xa0 This includes closer coordination with village elders in some of these places in Afghanistan who can vouch for the efforts of ISAF and our allies there.\xc2\xa0 All of these are part of an effort to mitigate the threat that are posed by these insider attacks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Make no mistake, though, that these attacks do not diminish in any way the commitment of the President, the commitment of our men and women in uniform, or the commitment of our allies to follow through and complete successfully the mission to end the war in Afghanistan by the end of 2014, to successfully and fully train Afghan security forces so that they can take security control of their own country by the end of 2014.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you guys keep a tally of the deaths?\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that it\xe2\x80\x99s the 2,000th?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The Defense Department does keep a tally of this.\xc2\xa0 I know that a number of media organizations do -- that accounts for some of the differing counts.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But for the Department of Defense\xe2\x80\x99s count, I would refer you to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, has the President made any progress on the brevity issue?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to tune it and you tell me on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 It is something he is well aware, and his team has pointed out to him that he needs to work on tightening and shortening his answers.\xc2\xa0 He understands what the format of the debate is.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned before, the team prepping him has watching many debates that Mitt Romney has done where he\xe2\x80\x99s been very disciplined with sharp, tight answers.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 Tune in on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Am I right, does early voting in Colorado start on Wednesday?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to double-check on that for you.\xc2\xa0 I can get you -- I can actually get you a list of the different states, if that\xe2\x80\x99s helpful.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The updated guidance went out with -- which reflects that you\xe2\x80\x99ll no longer be doing two days in Ohio, but a day in Wisconsin.\xc2\xa0 Does that suggest that you\xe2\x80\x99re more confident about Ohio?\xc2\xa0 Do you think Ohio is locked down?\xc2\xa0 Why did you decide to go to Wisconsin?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, one thing, if you love the Buckeye State, as I do -- because I have to by marriage -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll be back there. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be spending some time there again in the next few weeks.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve long said that we thought Wisconsin would be harder for us this year than it was four years ago.\xc2\xa0 Four years ago, we won the state by 14 points.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a state where the Romney team has obviously tried to create buzz around their ticket, given Ryan is a native son.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s spent a lot of time there.</p>\n<p>The good news for us is the more people are tuning in, in the state and learning about their plans to voucherize Medicare, their plans to extend tax cuts for the highest income while balancing that on the backs of middle class, their plans to cut Pell grants, the less they like what they\xe2\x80\x99re hearing.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not taking anything for granted in Wisconsin, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re going back there.</p>\n<p>On Ohio, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been there -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember the exact number -- I want to say it\xe2\x80\x99s 14 or 15 times, and as I mentioned, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be back.\xc2\xa0 We spent time there last week because early voting is starting there on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a key part of our strategy.\xc2\xa0 We know what the polls have said, but we absolutely expect they\xe2\x80\x99re going to tighten in Ohio, which is why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to spend more time there, why we continue to be up with ads, why we\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on our ground game.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Just to go back to the debates for a moment, when they say that this will be a game-changing performance and this will change the course of the race, the facts you really have to look at is where do polls and where do things stand and where do they look come next Friday, next Saturday, next Sunday in states like Ohio.\xc2\xa0 Is there a two-point gap?\xc2\xa0 Is it tied?\xc2\xa0 Because that\xe2\x80\x99s what game-changing means -- not the kind of zingers that you deliver on Wednesday night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on Henderson.\xc2\xa0 The President --</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re the Nevada expert.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go deep here -- frustrated -- do you remember when he made those comments about not blowing I think it was bailout money in Las Vegas, and he angered a lot of the local tourist folks and some casino heads?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if this trip is an attempt to make up for that.\xc2\xa0 Is he encouraging spending money in casinos in Las Vegas?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 As you know, I expect that if he visits some local shops, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be spending some of his very own money in Vegas the next few days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He has, not just from the number of visits that he has made here -- I mentioned those at the top of the briefing -- but also he\xe2\x80\x99s taken actions, working with his Jobs Council, working with his economic team, to promote travel and tourism in Nevada.\xc2\xa0 That speaks to his -- and other states across the country where tourism is a big part of the economy.\xc2\xa0 That speaks to his commitment to driving tourism, driving the recovery of the economy here in Nevada almost more than anything else.</p>\n<p>As you know, as a Nevada expert, another major issue here is housing.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that there\xe2\x80\x99s much more we need to do.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he talked in his weekly address yesterday about the need for Congress to move on his recent housing proposals so that people in the state could get $3,000 of benefits in reducing their mortgage costs.\xc2\xa0 That stands in stark contrast to -- as you know, Mitt Romney also chose Nevada to make his comments about how we should let the housing market hit bottom.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are a number of issues here where there\xe2\x80\x99s a clear choice between them.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s here because he knows we can win the state.\xc2\xa0 He wants to spend time talking with people in the state. And we believe that his commitment to the middle class is absolutely something that can resonate here on November 6th.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 One thing I would add to that is you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall earlier this year the President did announce a We Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wait initiative that involves streamlining the process for tourists in foreign countries to apply for visas, have them more quickly approved to foster foreign tourism in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 It was only within the last couple of weeks that the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security put out some metrics about the impact that this We Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wait initiative was having in terms of the increased pace and the larger number of applications that is having a benefit on communities that do have a large tourism economy.</p>\n<p>So if folks are interested in looking at that, I can pull some more statistics on that.\xc2\xa0 But there is -- for folks who are looking to write about this a little bit, we have some additional data we can provide to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the administration, the campaign, Democrats on the Hill have accused Republicans of trying to exploit the Libya situation for political gain.\xc2\xa0 But are there not sort of legitimate questions about what kind of security Ambassador Stevens had, what is the situation in Libya now?\xc2\xa0 I mean, where does it end?\xc2\xa0 Is it not fair enough for people to be asking these questions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple of things about that. One thing that we have done throughout this process is to inform you and the American public with the latest intelligence information about the circumstances surrounding this attack, about why it occurred, about who was responsible.\xc2\xa0 A lot of that underscores the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to holding accountable those, bringing to justice those who perpetrated this terrible attack.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve remained committed to trying to provide you and the American people the latest information on this investigation. That investigation is continuing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President and other senior members of this administration are closely following.\xc2\xa0 If we get to a position where we can share more information about that investigation, then we will do so.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of those who are asking questions, the President welcomes questions about the safety of our diplomats, because that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President places a top priority on.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that the President is paying close attention to.\xc2\xa0 The State Department is currently conducting a review to take a look at the security that was in place in Benghazi; on the night of that attack there was some.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re also taking a look at diplomatic installations all across the country, in other hot spots to ensure that security standards are appropriate.\xc2\xa0 That is something that the President is following closely, and that\xe2\x80\x99s information that he\xe2\x80\x99s briefed on, on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>So I recognize that, particularly in this political season\xc2\xa0 -- and here we are nearing October in an election year -- that there are going to be people who are going to be asking politically motivated questions.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for them.\xc2\xa0 I can speak for the President, and I can tell you that the President is not focused on the politics of the situation; he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on the safety and security of our diplomats, and he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on bringing to justice those who are responsible for perpetrating this terrible act.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Just two quick things to add.\xc2\xa0 There is only one candidate in this race who has politicized what is happening over in the Middle East, and that\xe2\x80\x99s Mitt Romney -- as evidenced from the statement he went out and made the night that these tragic events happened.\xc2\xa0 He was criticized for that not just by Democrats, but by Republicans and people of his own party, because people recognize that this is not a time for politicizing a tragedy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a time for the country to come together.</p>\n<p>The second thing I just wanted to mention is there\'s only one ticket that has a budget proposal that would cut funding -- could cut funding to our security at our embassies around the world.\xc2\xa0 And this raises into question what their priorities are, too.</p>\n<p>So I\'ll leave you with that.</p>\n<p>QThank you, guys.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:28 P.M.
