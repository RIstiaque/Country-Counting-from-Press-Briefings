BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 A couple logistics before I introduce you to Secretary Vilsack here.\xc2\xa0 At 12:30 p.m. we\xe2\x80\x99re doing a tour of Siemens Energy in Fort Madison.\xc2\xa0 This is a business that embodies the opportunities that emerging clean energy economy presents.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you speak up?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble hearing you.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 This is a business that embodies the opportunities that clean -- the emerging clean energy economy presents for both rural communities and towns and cities across the country.\xc2\xa0 Specifically this facility receives nearly $3.5 million in Recovery Act tax credits for clean energy manufacturing jobs.\xc2\xa0 The plant was closed just a few short years ago, and now employs more than 600 employees, almost two-thirds of whom --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many employees?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Six hundred, almost two-thirds of whom were unemployed just a few years ago.\xc2\xa0 And it supports more than 350 other jobs throughout Lee County.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The participants -- and I\'ll get you these spellings -- Robert Gjuraj, the plant manager at Siemens, is going to lead the President on a tour.\xc2\xa0 Peter Loescher, the CEO, will be there; Secretary Vilsack, of course.\xc2\xa0 The audience where the President will give remarks is made up of about 230 employees and about 100 White House guests.\xc2\xa0 In his remarks, the President will discuss the economic pain that towns like Mount Pleasant are feeling, and also their economic potential.\xc2\xa0 While the economy is showing signs of improvement, the recovery isn\xe2\x80\x99t reaching everyone just yet.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll also discuss some issues important to middle-class families there in the area like college affordability, clean energy economy, health insurance reform and Wall Street reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, Bill, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear that, what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to discuss.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Issues like college affordability, Wall Street reform, health care reform, and a clean energy economy.</p>\n<p>And then after that -- and I\'ll talk to you guys a little bit embargoed after we get to the end, because it\xe2\x80\x99s an off-the record stop.\xc2\xa0 Then at 4:40 p.m. the President is going to Indian Hills Community College for a town hall.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s in Ottumwa.\xc2\xa0 There will be approximately 2,100 people in the audience.\xc2\xa0 Seventy percent of the tickets were general admission, first come, first serve, distributed on Monday, and about 30 percent were handed out to local groups and community leaders.\xc2\xa0 In the crowd there you\xe2\x80\x99ll have Attorney General Tom Miller, the mayor of Ottumwa Dale Uehling, and introducing the President will be William Wynn.</p>\n<p>To talk a little bit more about -- any question about any of that?\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 To talk a little bit more about Iowa and what USDA is doing is Secretary Vilsack.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 This is why this particular trip is so important.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a silent crisis occurring in rural America that\xe2\x80\x99s been ongoing for several decades -- substantially higher unemployment and poverty rates, significant reduction in terms of college-educated work force and an aging work force and loss of population.</p>\n<p>The President, because of what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing on -- in energy, what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with broadband expansion, what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with directing local production to linking local consumers with farmers selling locally instead of in far-away markets and some of the work that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in conservation has created a new framework for a new economy, a revival of the rural economy.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see examples of it on this trip.</p>\n<p>Siemens basically makes components for windmills.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to a state that now has 20 percent of its energy from wind power -- 20 percent.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to see an effort to promote community colleges and a well-educated work force, in large part because of the contributions the administration is making in community college access and college affordability.</p>\n<p>Later, tomorrow, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a chance to see a renewable energy facility.\xc2\xa0 All of that is part and parcel of this new rural economy that we\xe2\x80\x99re helping to build, and this is a tremendous opportunity for us to educate people across the country about the status of rural America, which is the source of their food, their fuel, their water.\xc2\xa0 And an ever-increasing percentage of people who serve in the military come from small towns and rural areas.\xc2\xa0 It represents one-sixth of the country\xe2\x80\x99s population but 45 percent of those who serve in uniform come from these small communities.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s -- our value system is rooted here.</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s time, and I\'m certainly pleased the President is paying this kind of attention.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s long overdue, in terms of decades of a lack of real attention to rural issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, did you say 20 percent of Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s energy comes from the wind?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I said.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know how that compares to other states?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Iowa is currently the number one state in the country for the percentage of wind-generated electricity on the grid.\xc2\xa0 California and Texas have more capacity than Iowa; Iowa is third.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s number one in terms of actually getting the energy on the grid and getting it into homes and businesses.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you -- polls in Iowa show that the President\xe2\x80\x99s popularity there has dropped.\xc2\xa0 I mean, how would you -- what would be the argument you would make to the people of Iowa to say, support the President, or what do you see as the issue there?\xc2\xa0 Why do you think that is?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 I\'m happy to answer this if you want.\xc2\xa0 It is really about making sure folks know precisely what this administration has done.\xc2\xa0 When you basically take on health care, as this administration has, you are helping rural America, because no one got a shorter end of a very long stick on health care than folks living in rural communities and small towns, which is the vast majority of folks in my state -- a substantial majority of folks who live in my state.</p>\n<p>Secondly, college education is a real issue for people in Iowa.\xc2\xa0 When they know what this administration has done in reducing the cost of college education for youngsters -- increasing Pell Grants, making community college investments -- historic investments in community colleges, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to understand this is an administration that\xe2\x80\x99s working for them.\xc2\xa0 And when they understand and appreciate how much attention this President is paying to rural issues and how much attention his Cabinet is paying to rural issues, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see a greater appreciation for what the administration has done.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of making sure we tell our story.</p>\n<p>This President has been so busy doing things, the rest of us have to do a better job, including myself, of telling the story better, because once you tell the story, people go, geez, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s good, that\xe2\x80\x99s great, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to help us.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The energy and climate change bill that was being worked on, the bipartisan effort, seems to have collapsed.\xc2\xa0 Senator Graham says he\xe2\x80\x99s sort of out of the picture at this point.\xc2\xa0 What does that mean for states like Iowa, and what do you think that you and the White House can do to sort of kickstart things again?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 First of all, let me say I\'m confident we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get an energy bill, because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This year?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 I\'m confident we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get an energy bill.\xc2\xa0 I think people are committed to it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity to talk to a number of senators about this.\xc2\xa0 It is a great opportunity for rural America.\xc2\xa0 You will see a significant amount of investment, new investment, not only in energy and fuel production but also in the credits that will be given to farmers to help offset power companies\xe2\x80\x99 utilization of greenhouse gas issues.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous opportunity to add capital into rural America.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously supportive of this and appreciate, again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership.\xc2\xa0 And I believe at the end of the day, there will be bipartisan leadership on this.\xc2\xa0 I\'m confident it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing for the country.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Any other questions on the trip to Iowa?\xc2\xa0 All right, thank you, Secretary.\xc2\xa0 Really appreciate it.</p>\n<p>Anything else, you guys?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Generally on a lot of these issues, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s financial reform or health care or an energy bill, the White House seems to be trying to convince voters that the bill itself is a good thing, and the message from a lot of voters seems to be, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want a big, aggressive, muscly government; we want something smaller and less ambitious.\xc2\xa0 How does the President on a general level deliver that message, apart from the specific legislation that he may be promoting at any given moment?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re on our way to Iowa, a place where the President spent a lot of time over the course of the last couple years, and the President has a real sense of what Americans in Iowa and all over the country are looking for from their government.\xc2\xa0 And the President agrees that in places where the government ought to get out of the way so that small businesses and large businesses can prosper and can do a good job, he thinks that they should.\xc2\xa0 But in places where the government can step in and actually do things like regulate Wall Street in a better way that makes sure that we avoid the kind of crises we avoided in the past, take an approach to student loans so that we\xe2\x80\x99re saving tens of billions of dollars that go directly to students as opposed to middleman banks on the way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And also the President had to do a lot of things that nobody would have chosen to do just because of the circumstances that were around him when he came in, like helping out the auto industry, saving a million jobs; helping out the financial industry in a way that helped Wall Street from collapsing.</p>\n<p>So I would say that the balance is, the President is committed to making sure that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing the sort of things that help individuals and businesses prosper but not getting in the way where it can be a hindrance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of anger over the Arizona immigration bill -- protests and vandalism now.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a message for these people who oppose this bill and want to see the federal government take some action here?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you repeat the question?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 She asked about the Arizona immigration law and some of the anger surrounding it, the protests, and what the President thinks about it.\xc2\xa0 The President made his views clear on this.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s important to the President right now is that his administration take a hard look at the law and its implications and what actions are appropriate for the federal government to take.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of that process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a result of that that we\xe2\x80\x99ll know before this Arizona law goes into effect?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think that the President will hear back from his team sooner than later.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, back on the energy question, the Times and other people, folks up on the Hill, are sort of saying the White House needs to get involved to put this marriage back together, get Harry Reid and Lindsey Graham talking.\xc2\xa0 Can you just sort of fill us in on what activity you guys are undertaking and if the President is going to intervene personally?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Question, please, Bill?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The question was, what is the President going to do to intervene personally to get Graham and Reid talking again; what\xe2\x80\x99s he doing on energy.</p>\n<p>You know, on all these issues, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear where the President is, what he thinks is the most appropriate action to take.</p>\n<p>Now, if you look at the substance of energy, there is bipartisan agreement on some of the solutions that we ought to undertake.\xc2\xa0 On the process, there are some issues that are being worked out between senators of both sides.</p>\n<p>So the President and his team have been working to make progress on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like things are working out at all.\xc2\xa0 I mean, Graham yesterday said that basically it was dead unless immigration was taken completely off the table.\xc2\xa0 I mean, are you guys willing to take immigration completely off the table this year?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, for starters, we are closer to an energy bill than we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in a very long time.\xc2\xa0 And the President feels like the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made is very good.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s agreement, like I said, on what we need to do in order to move forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But in terms of process, when you look at immigration, Republicans and Democrats agree that there is a real problem with immigration as it currently stands.\xc2\xa0 So on the substance of that, the President thinks, yes, we do have to act.</p>\n<p>Now, in terms of order, which comes first, who needs to talk to who, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s wide agreement that more progress has been made on energy.\xc2\xa0 And I think, in a story that I read by Glenn Thrush in Politico, even Harry Reid\xe2\x80\x99s folks are saying that energy looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s going first.</p>\n<p>But Senator Graham has worked courageously with Democrats and with the White House on some of these big, important issues and we hope to continue to make more progress till we get completion on them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last bite at that, I\'m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Are you just -- are you going to sort of prevail upon Senator Graham to sort of drop that blanket objection to immigration being thrown out this year?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to go conversation by conversation what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be said.\xc2\xa0 But obviously we are in contact with Senator Graham, as are leaders on the Hill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, where does it stand on Wall Street reform?\xc2\xa0 Senator Reid scheduled another vote today.\xc2\xa0 Are you going to -- is there going to be a different vote than yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the current vote count is.\xc2\xa0 But I do know that the American people are looking to see Wall Street reform so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t see the kind of crisis that we came upon the last couple of years.</p>\n<p>The President thinks that we can have a bill by the time we get to the anniversary of the collapse of -- the near collapse of Wall Street, and he\xe2\x80\x99s confident that we are going to get bipartisan agreement and voted into law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he have any conversations with Reid last night or this morning or any other lawmakers on the Hill about this?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 None that I know of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s stops have the feel of a campaign, and here we are in Iowa.\xc2\xa0 Should we see this as the start of his 2012 reelection?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 God, I hope this is not the start of the 2012 reelection.\xc2\xa0 This is one -- this is actually the middle part of the White House to Main Street tour.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve spent time in -- the President spent time in Savannah; he spent time in Lorain County, Ohio; we were in Allentown.\xc2\xa0 A lot of you guys were along for those trips.\xc2\xa0 This is just one piece of the American pie that the President is going out to commune with today to hear their concerns, to talk about what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to these visits.\xc2\xa0 He gets a lot out of being with Americans of all stripes.</p>\n<p>In 2007 he spent a lot of time in this state.\xc2\xa0 And so this will be a lot of fun to go back to some of these towns.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Grassley is up for reelection this year.\xc2\xa0 And in a year when incumbents of both parties are in danger, the Democrats couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really find a serious challenger to stand up to him.\xc2\xa0 Is that worrisome to the President, given the state of the party?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s actually appropriate for me to go race by race and how our candidates are doing.\xc2\xa0 But I will say overall the President\xe2\x80\x99s feeling is that good policy is good politics.\xc2\xa0 So the things that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing in Washington with the Democratic Party are helping to grow our economy, are helping to keep Americans safe, and he thinks that at the end of the day, when the choice is between our view versus others, that people will see our view as one that\xe2\x80\x99s helping our country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, do you know if Alexi Giannoulias, the Democratic Senate candidate, is going to be at the Illinois event?\xc2\xa0 And if he is, is the President going to give him a shoutout?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure who all is coming.\xc2\xa0 I know that all the statewide elected officials are invited to these things.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 His office said yesterday that he was going to be there.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, there you go.\xc2\xa0 You should have asked Roger.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the President is going to acknowledge his presence and talk a little bit about his campaign, which is sort of having some trouble at the moment?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be appropriate for the President to talk about anybody\xe2\x80\x99s campaign at what are all official events.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n12:06 P.M.
