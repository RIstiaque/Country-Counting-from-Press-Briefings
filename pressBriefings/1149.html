EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I assume I\xe2\x80\x99ll have questions about what the President is doing in El Paso today.\xc2\xa0 Briefly, obviously, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be giving a speech to talk about the need for comprehensive immigration reform, about the need to increase support, why it\xe2\x80\x99s an economic imperative, in particular, to keep us competitive in the 21st century.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll also -- I think as you know, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be touring the Bridge of the Americas commercial cargo facility in El Paso.\xc2\xa0 Of the four crossing that comprise the El Paso port of entry, the Bridge of the Americas is the largest, facilitating both passenger and commercial traffic.\xc2\xa0 On average, 1,200 to 1,600 trucks a day import commodities through this location.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama will be led on the tour by Ana Hinojosa, the director of field operations at the Bridge of the Americas, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be accompanied by the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Alan Bersin.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During the tour the President will be shown a mobile truck X-ray and be given an overview of large-scale technology designed to protect and prevent radiological threats.\xc2\xa0 He will also view a demonstration of border patrol personnel searching commercial cargo.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Boehner last night, line in the sand -- helpful to the process, or no?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I would say about that, Hans, is that the Speaker indicated that he supports significant deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 The President supports significant deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 All parties to these negotiations recognize the problem and share a similar idea about what the goal should be, which is roughly $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 to 12 years.\xc2\xa0 That in it and of itself is progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously we disagree with the House Republican budget plan, which we made clear.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we need to achieve that $4 trillion in deficit reduction in a balanced way and not solely by cutting entitlements and eliminating, in the case of the House Republican plan, the Medicare guaranteed to our seniors.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 However, he believes that the negotiations, the talks being led by the Vice President, will continue to be productive as all sides seek common ground towards further deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 We believe that will take place.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And no less important is the urgent need to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 We continue to maintain that the -- it is folly to hold hostage the vote to raise the debt ceiling to prevent the United States of America from defaulting on its obligations to any other piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 We will get a fiscal agreement, we believe.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re optimistic.\xc2\xa0 We believe we can get that.\xc2\xa0 But to hold one hostage to the other remains extremely unwise in our view.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would simply note some of the things that Speaker Boehner has said in the past, if I have them here, about just that issue.\xc2\xa0 Back in the last day of January -- or, no, January 30th, rather, he said -- this is the Speaker of the House -- to raise that -- failing to raise the debt ceiling would mean, \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial disaster not only for our country but for the worldwide economy.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t create jobs if you default on the federal debt.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree more.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could fast-forward it to last night, did you hear Boehner as a hostage-taker or a deal-maker?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe that it is fine for all participants in this process to restate their starting positions.\xc2\xa0 That we understand.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that there is -- that common ground can be found between Republicans and Democrats in these negotiations being overseen by the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to be optimistic.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the idea that cuts will have to equal the amount that the debt ceiling is raised, that\xe2\x80\x99s not new to you?\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that from Boehner before?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, but what I meant was that the position that eliminating the Medicare program as we know it remains on the table, but dealing with tax expenditures is off the table.\xc2\xa0 Maximalist positions do not produce compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just Boehner that\xe2\x80\x99s saying that on the tax expenditures, it\xe2\x80\x99s Kyl too.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand, Hans, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate the particulars here, but what the purpose of the negotiations is, is for the -- all sides to find common ground, and I think that common ground can be found.\xc2\xa0 The balance and the particulars are not something that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to negotiate at 30,000 feet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- his position not undermine the talks that are going on at Blair House with the Vice President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe that it does, no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Texas governor is upset that there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a disaster declaration covering the wildfires there.\xc2\xa0 Some Republicans have suggested that perhaps politics is playing a role in there, and one has even said it\xe2\x80\x99s inappropriate for him to be raising funds in the state without such a declaration.\xc2\xa0 How do you answer that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would love to answer that.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for everyone to know that this administration has been extremely responsive to the state of Texas\xe2\x80\x99 requests for wildfire management assisting grants -- 25 of them at last count.\xc2\xa0 All that have been requested had been, as far as I know it, have been provided.\xc2\xa0 And that -- in each case, because wildfires are different from other natural disasters -- they are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And in each case the federal government, the federal taxpayer, is paying 75 percent of the costs of fighting these fires of Texas -- 75 percent.\xc2\xa0 So there is plenty, considerable federal assistance flowing to Texas to deal with these serious wildfires.\xc2\xa0 We take this very seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the fact is, is that because wildfires are the kind of natural disaster that they are and fighting them is a major cost here, the federal government is picking up a substantial portion of that cost.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I would say -- can I just point out that the suggestion that you are raising that some I guess some Republicans think that this is political, I would just point to the disaster declarations that the President has designated from across the country, and I think there was no discrimination here between red and blue states.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is the President not meeting with Governor Perry?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Governor Perry turned down our invitation to meet the President at the airport.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He wanted a more substantial meeting and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have to go 800 miles all the way to El Paso to discuss the wildfires and border security and all that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we invited him to meet with the President and he declined the invitation.\xc2\xa0 We have also in the past offered him a National Security Council briefing on immigration; he declined that as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is his request for a thousand more National Guardsmen under any kind of consideration at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have substantially increased the number of border patrol agents twice -- more than 20,000 now -- twice the number that there were in 2004.\xc2\xa0 We have tripled the number of intelligence agents -- analysts who are working on border patrol.\xc2\xa0 We have -- let me just get out my trusty fact sheet here -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve deployed unmanned aerial vehicles that now patrol the border from Texas to California.\xc2\xa0 For the first time, we are screening 100 percent of southbound rail shipments to seize guns and money going south, even as we go after the drugs that are heading north.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve forged a partnership with Mexico to fight the transnational criminal organizations that have affected both of our countries.\xc2\xa0 And I would add that in terms of the presence of the National Guard there, we intend to maintain that presence and to work with Congress to get the funding necessary to maintain the border -- the National Guard presence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the immigration reform that the President is going to discuss today, will he be discussing specifics -- for instance, hurdles that illegal immigrants would face in order to get on the path to citizenship?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to steal the President\xe2\x80\x99s thunder.\xc2\xa0 I encourage you to listen to the speech.\xc2\xa0 But he will talk about all the issues that encompass comprehensive immigration reform, from the need for border security, the need to deal with this underground economy that depresses wages, that allows bad actors in business to compete unfairly with those who follow the rules and obey the law, and the need to reform our legal immigration laws so that we\xe2\x80\x99re making sure that we essentially take advantage of the enormous talent that we find in our universities and not train the competition, but have those immigrants who are here studying at the best universities in the world start companies here in the United States instead of taking them overseas to our competitors.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House intend to submit its own legislation on immigration reform, or are you going to leave the work to Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview our legislative strategy from here, but we\xe2\x80\x99re -- the approach we\xe2\x80\x99re taking is we are trying to -- recognizing the hurdles that we have faced legislatively, we are trying to build awareness and support for the need for comprehensive immigration reform, to fix this broken system.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d just remind you that the stakeholders that we have talked with represent Republicans and Democrats, businesses, a variety of interest groups.\xc2\xa0 This is -- the need for this, as in so many cases, the train is leaving the station and Washington is still trying to find the train station.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s -- this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping that we can push from the outside in here to get Congress to address the fact that this is a broken system that needs to be fixed, and that used to have bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons why we\xe2\x80\x99re told -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been told, all of us in the United States have been told, that those who used to support comprehensive immigration reform in the Republican Party backed away from that support because they wanted borders first.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, everything that was demanded has been provided in terms of increased border patrol, increased efforts to secure our borders, and so we look forward to some of those supporters returning to the table to try to figure out this problem and fix the broken system.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if it\xe2\x80\x99s so urgent, why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you providing a timetable then?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because, as you know, Hans, there are a lot of ways to skin a cat in Washington when you\'re talking about getting things done.\xc2\xa0 And we have a strategy here to try to get another hard thing done, and we\xe2\x80\x99re following that strategy because we believe it gives us the best chance of success.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask, if it\xe2\x80\x99s so urgent, why did the President wait almost two and a half years since he took office to visit the border?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, come on -- I mean, there have been quite a few things going on in the last two and a half years -- the worst recession since the Great Depression, two wars, the hunt for Osama bin Laden that ended successfully a few days ago, among many, many other issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is notable -- the irony of your question, if I may, is that I was getting the opposite questions:\xc2\xa0 Why are you bothering when you know it\xe2\x80\x99s so politically difficult to achieve this.\xc2\xa0 Are you really serious?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just like people said the same thing about whether or not the President was serious about fiscal reform, the answer is yes.\xc2\xa0 Is he serious about comprehensive immigration reform?\xc2\xa0 The answer is yes.\xc2\xa0 He feels that he was hired to try to do some hard things, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to try to do them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could we do one on Pakistan?\xc2\xa0 The offer to let the wives be interviewed, is that sufficient or will the U.S. be calling for more?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we have an important and complicated relationship with Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 We are working avidly with our Pakistani counterparts to continue the cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the past.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re optimistic that that cooperation will continue with regards to the issues that you\xe2\x80\x99ve raised, access to the -- to Mr. bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s wives and also to the materials that were collected by the Pakistanis after the U.S. commandos left, and of course on all the other issues that we need cooperation on with the Pakistanis.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Navy chaplaincy has approved the -- officiating of same-sex marriages at Navy chapels, pending a full certification of the repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 There have been some members that have been complaining that that brings the administration\xe2\x80\x99s pledge to uphold -- or to, I should say, follow DOMA, if not defend it.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration feel that that\xe2\x80\x99s still legal under DOMA?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that, and so I suggest you ask the Department of Defense since I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that story.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, to get back to Pakistan, what kind of communications and interactions is the administration having with the Pakistani government now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we maintain our contacts at a variety of levels of -- senior levels of the government, as we did prior to the mission against bin Laden.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken again or will he be speaking again with President Zardari?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will speak again with President Zardari.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that\xe2\x80\x99s he has had another conversation with him since the evening of May 1st.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a quick issue here.\xc2\xa0 Some of the folks in the cabin were startled to see a plane fly underneath Air Force One, about the time we were just south of Dulles, I believe.\xc2\xa0 Are you aware that there was anything too close or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I was not aware that happened, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I would have been told if there were an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about the political dimensions of the visit to Texas?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s raising money in Austin.\xc2\xa0 How confident is the President about carrying the state of Texas in the 2012 election?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he obviously did not carry it in 2008, but the President believes strongly that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give up on any state.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just citing something he said recently about that.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk on other occasions about how much he enjoys coming to Texas.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s glad to be here.\xc2\xa0 He knows he has a lot of supporters here; it\xe2\x80\x99s a big state.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll be back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could go back to deficit and debt, are you -- in an answer to Darlene, you said that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s talk -- speech last night undermined the process.\xc2\xa0 And then earlier you said that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was helpful to restate starting positions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 I said it\xe2\x80\x99s fine to restate starting positions.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it was unhelpful.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s fine --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We understand that there are starting positions.\xc2\xa0 We also understand that compromise involves acknowledging that you have to move off of your starting position.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of the nature of compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything on -- the President take a look at the window at the swelling Mississippi?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him do that but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been with him for the full flight so far.\xc2\xa0 I remember when we were flying out of Fort Campbell on Friday there was a lot of flooding in Kentucky.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously quite devastating what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing now on television.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any plans for the President to take a closer look at the impact of the flooding?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling updates.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anybody else?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 12:31 P.M.
