CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Thanks for being here. \xc2\xa0Good afternoon. \xc2\xa0I, as you can see, have brought a guest. \xc2\xa0Jason Furman is the Principal Deputy Director of the National Economic Council. \xc2\xa0He is also an assistant to the President for economic policy. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s somebody that many of you are familiar with.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIn the last several days in particular we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of questions and a lot of conversation about the issue of revenue, and how we achieve significant revenue as part of a broad deficit reduction package. \xc2\xa0It is the President\xe2\x80\x99s position, as you know, that we need to have income tax rates on the highest earners in America, the top 2 percent, rise. \xc2\xa0And in addition to that, to pass policies that he has long proposed that would limit deductions and close loopholes for wealthy earners. \xc2\xa0And the combination of the revenue accomplished through that reaches the target that is necessary to achieve the kind of broad-based $4 trillion deficit reduction that the President seeks.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s been some discussion about whether or not significant amounts of revenue can be accomplished through just closing loopholes and capping deductions. \xc2\xa0Jason has done some work on this and for that reason I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked him to come here today. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99ll make a little presentation and then take your questions.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay. \xc2\xa0So I just briefly wanted to give a tiny bit of context, then walk you through a tiny bit of math that can be a little bit boring but is very important because it explains where we\xe2\x80\x99re coming from and where the President is coming from on this issue.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe context is we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to cut the deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade, including what we did in the Budget Control Act. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the amount that you need to do in order to stabilize the debt and get the debt to start to be on a downward path as a share of the economy. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately the economic goal that the President has in a debt reduction agreement. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIn the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan, $1.6 trillion of that $4 trillion that we need would come from additional revenues. \xc2\xa0And it would come from a combination of allowing the rates on high earners to go back up to what they were under President Clinton, and reducing the value of tax deductions and other tax benefits that they get.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBefore I get to how much can be raised by the second, let me just say the President is very, very supportive of curbing tax deductions for high-income households. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been a part of his plan from his very first budget. \xc2\xa0In fact, he was and remains the only major leaguer in Washington that has put forward a specific, explicit plan that would limit those tax benefits for high-income households that\xe2\x80\x99s been examined by the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is the official referee for these issues in Congress. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThat plan, though, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t raise the revenue that you need. \xc2\xa0So out of the President\xe2\x80\x99s $1.6 trillion, $950 billion comes from decoupling. \xc2\xa0Decoupling is the high-income rates going away, the middle-class tax cuts becoming permanent. \xc2\xa0That gets you $950 billion of revenue. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe question is could you plausibly replace that revenue just by limiting tax expenditures. \xc2\xa0There have been lots of different ideas out there. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s always a little bit like Jell-O -- you look over here, the problem with this one; well, how about this one; the problem with that could fix this, and you go back to the first one. \xc2\xa0Most of them -- in fact, none of them that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen have been scored, as I said, by the official referees at the Joint Committee on Taxation.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll just quickly take you through one that Gene Sperling and I did a blog post on last week, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been the one that I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the most in the public debate, which is let\xe2\x80\x99s take the idea that you could take everyone\xe2\x80\x99s tax deductions, limit them to $25,000. \xc2\xa0If you have more than $25,000 in deductions you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get to take those extra deductions. \xc2\xa0It sounds like a reasonable idea. \xc2\xa0It sounds like most middle-class families wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be affected -- $25,000 is quite a lot. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s been claimed that it could raise over a trillion dollars. \xc2\xa0So could you do that instead of what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWell, then you start to look at the idea. \xc2\xa0It turns out 17 million middle-class families would see their taxes go up as a result of this proposal, households that make -- married couples that make below $250,000. \xc2\xa0Forty percent of the revenue in this plan would come from those middle-class families. \xc2\xa0The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to raise taxes on those families. \xc2\xa0So you fix it -- you start at $250,000 and now the proposal only raises $800 billion.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut it has a cliff: \xc2\xa0When your income goes from $249,999 to $250,000, your tax bill could jump way up. \xc2\xa0You can\xe2\x80\x99t have features in the tax code like that. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s something no one would ever want to write in. \xc2\xa0You protect against that cliff with a phase-in; now you\xe2\x80\x99re down to only $650 billion of revenue.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNow let\xe2\x80\x99s look at it from a public policy perspective: \xc2\xa0$25,000 -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re a high-income household, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance your mortgage interest alone is going to be $25,000. \xc2\xa0Certainly once you take your mortgage interest and your state and local deduction, you\xe2\x80\x99ve used that entire thing. \xc2\xa0That means you\xe2\x80\x99re not getting any incentive to give to charity. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason for you to keep your receipts when you give to charity, no reason to turn them into the IRS. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve used your whole cap just on those other items.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYou look at the top 1 percent of households in this country -- under this proposal, 97 percent of them would lose any incentive at all to give additional money to charity. \xc2\xa0These are households that are responsible for one-third of tax-deductible giving. \xc2\xa0You take away their charitable deduction completely, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get $10 billion less a year going into charity according to the types of estimates CBO has done. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tFix the charity -- you\xe2\x80\x99re now down at $450 billion; $450 billion is a meaningful contribution to deficit reduction, it could be a meaningful part of tax reform. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get you anywhere close to the amount of revenue you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to satisfy what it is the President has called for and to have a balanced plan that at the end of the day is going to get $4 trillion of deficit reduction.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI won\xe2\x80\x99t walk you through the 18 other ideas that have been floated in some form or another in the public discourse, but all of them have this feature. \xc2\xa0A plan put forward by Marty Feldstein and Maya MacGuineas that some have cited, to cap the value at 2 percent, that also would raise about $500 billion to $600 billion. \xc2\xa0If you just applied it to households above $250,000 and if you protected charity that idea would also raise in the neighborhood of $400 billion to $500 billion. \xc2\xa0Other proposals would retroactively eliminate municipal bonds, all of those types of things.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo at the end of the day, that\xe2\x80\x99s why where the President is coming from is a combination of those rates -- having the tax cuts expire, doing tax expenditures -- tax expenditures can play a role, but they can\xe2\x80\x99t make up for the revenue that you would have gotten through rates.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Now we\xe2\x80\x99ll take some questions for Jason. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tGo ahead.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jason, the Republicans are pointing to comments that the President made in 2011 in which he said we could raise $1.2 trillion in revenues without touching tax rates. \xc2\xa0I guess if it was an acceptable approach back then, why not now?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0First of all, there\xe2\x80\x99s a different context for those discussions then and the discussions now, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something Jay can elaborate on with you in a second. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSecond of all, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at how that agreement was structured. \xc2\xa0The agreement then was Republicans had offered decoupling. \xc2\xa0They had offered that on January 1st, 2013, the middle-class tax cuts would be made permanent and high-income taxes would go back to the Clinton-era rates if tax reform didn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed. \xc2\xa0So if we weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to accomplish through tax reform -- if you put forward -- and that could be you put forward a plan that got rid of the charitable deduction, that raised taxes on the middle-class families, that plan got voted down. \xc2\xa0Under that agreement then you would have had the type of decoupling that the President is calling for. \xc2\xa0It would have happened on the time scale as what the President is calling for.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe last point I\xe2\x80\x99d make is that our argument centers around the plausibility and desirability of the tax reform. \xc2\xa0Is it politically plausible to raise taxes on the middle class to get rid of the charitable deduction? \xc2\xa0Is it economically desirable to do those things? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the President, Jay, no one on the economic team has ever argued that it\xe2\x80\x99s mathematically impossible to make up for that revenue. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s just at the end of the day, you might have a question in a tax plan: \xc2\xa0Would you rather have a higher tax rate, or would you rather have a charitable deduction? \xc2\xa0I think most people, Democrats and Republicans, would rather have a slightly higher tax rate than eliminate the charitable deduction.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut you might want to talk about the context.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take some more questions. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tGo ahead, Jake.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m following up on that, so if you want to weigh in on the political context.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I would simply, first of all, echo what Jason said, and that is that a key element that\xe2\x80\x99s not being discussed by people who are putting forward that comment by the President is that the backstop of the deal \xc2\xa0-- if there had been a deal, if the Republicans hadn\xe2\x80\x99t refused it and walked away from it -- was that the rates would go up on higher-income Americans when the Bush-era tax cuts expired, concurrent with a permanent extension of tax cuts for the middle class. \xc2\xa0The only way that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened is if tax reform were achieved in a way that was politically feasible -- in other words, that could pass Congress.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s not a great distinction here between what we\xe2\x80\x99re saying now. \xc2\xa0The difference is back then, January 1st, 2013 created some time to attempt to do tax reform. \xc2\xa0January 1st, 2013 is now less than a month away. \xc2\xa0And tax rates have to go up as part of any responsible, balanced plan that achieves the revenue targets that are necessary for a $4 trillion deficit reduction plan, which is what the President seeks. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tHe has said -- he said yesterday in an interview that stage two of this process can and should involve tax reform. \xc2\xa0And what shape that takes will be decided by Congress and the White House as they work through the issues and evaluate some of these concerns that Jason is talking about. \xc2\xa0How much can we garner from capping deductions, closing loopholes? \xc2\xa0And there are limits on that amount, as Jason just explained, because not just -- not because it\xe2\x80\x99s not hypothetically possible in a think tank to achieve it, but because it\xe2\x80\x99s not desirable economic policy and it\xe2\x80\x99s not politically feasible. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAgain, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that Democrats or Republicans would vote to eliminate the charitable tax deduction. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that anyone on Capitol Hill would vote for such substantial reductions or even an elimination of the mortgage interest deduction that it would severely raise taxes on the middle class. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable to the President, but I imagine it\xe2\x80\x99s also unacceptable to many Republicans.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I just don\xe2\x80\x99t see the difference other than the President feels like he\xe2\x80\x99s in a different position in terms of negotiations, maybe that he feels that he has a stronger hand now because of the reelection and because the tax rates automatically go up. \xc2\xa0But, I mean, what he said was -- I mean, the quote is -- \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we said was give us $1.2 trillion in additional revenues, which could be accomplished without hiking tax rates, that could simply be accomplished by eliminating loopholes, eliminating some deductions, and engaging in a tax reform process that could have lowered rates.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0It seems to me like here\xe2\x80\x99s your solution right now: \xc2\xa0Just agree to this and we can all go home and have a Christmas vacation.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask Jason to do some substance. \xc2\xa0I would remind you that the Republicans did not agree to that. \xc2\xa0They didn\xe2\x80\x99t even come close for the third time --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It sounds like you don\xe2\x80\x99t agree to it now either.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0No, but the thing is he said we could have a process to look at tax reform, to see if we can close loopholes and cap deductions. \xc2\xa0But the fundamental aspect of that potential agreement, which Republicans walked away from, was that rates would go up on high-income earners next month if tax reform was not achieved. \xc2\xa0And that required tax reform passing Congress.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Jason.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0Yes, I mean, two things -- one is I could just repeat the same example or switch over to a second or third or fourth example and walk through all of them, and explain why it is we have. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot of work on this topic since last summer --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the President changed his position.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0And the second thing is what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to do is to lock in revenue this year, not have some vague process that may or may not add up to something in the future. \xc2\xa0And so we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to pass something this month. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to pass something this month rather than launch some long process, some long discussion. \xc2\xa0We really need to see what those proposals are. \xc2\xa0The proposals we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen all have these types of flaws that I\xe2\x80\x99ve identified. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s another proposal out there, because me and other members of the economic team spent enormous amounts of time on all of this. \xc2\xa0But if there are, they should bring them forward. \xc2\xa0We should see them. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s been so frustrating. \xc2\xa0They keep saying, let\xe2\x80\x99s not do rates, let\xe2\x80\x99s do this. \xc2\xa0Well, what is this? \xc2\xa0What is it? \xc2\xa0Point to it. \xc2\xa0Tell us what it is. \xc2\xa0Show us a score. \xc2\xa0Tell us how it locks in revenue -- because you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to actually pass a bill this year, not engage in some long process around tax reform, which we don\xe2\x80\x99t have time to do by the end of this year.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jason, can I ask, you get to $1.6 trillion not just by raising tax rates. \xc2\xa0How could you achieve those additional revenues without doing damage to the U.S. housing market or to hurting the charities and non-profits that the President talked about last night?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0In the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal you have the decoupling that gets you $950 [billion], and then he has an additional proposal where he takes the value of tax deductions and other tax expenditures, and limits their value to 28 percent, which is what you\xe2\x80\x99d get if you were upper-middle class -- in effect, you\xe2\x80\x99d get 28 percent value for all of those. \xc2\xa0And so he trims them across the board and he saves several hundred billion dollars with that proposal. \xc2\xa0The exact amount depends on where the tax rate is and who\xe2\x80\x99s doing the scoring.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tHe thinks that type of thing -- targeted high-income households done in a way that trims things across the board, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bluntly eliminate anything, would be sound economic policy and it\xe2\x80\x99s something he\xe2\x80\x99s defended over the last several years.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s people keep saying that they\xe2\x80\x99re not eliminating the charitable deduction, and keep saying that, but that they want to limit it. \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a different --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0Okay, but I --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between -- but you keep using the word \xe2\x80\x9celiminate\xe2\x80\x9d --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0No, no, but I guess -- I mean, but this is another --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it on paper. \xc2\xa0You can tell me --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0I have heard them refer to a report by the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget and say -- we sometimes ask, how do you get it? \xc2\xa0Well, often we\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you guys, you\xe2\x80\x99ll ask them, they\xe2\x80\x99ll point you to this report. \xc2\xa0This report, I have it here, it has three plans in it. \xc2\xa0Two of those three plans eliminate the charitable deduction for the majority of high-income households in this country. \xc2\xa0So you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell people you have a plan, point to a document that you say contains three different plans that could be like your plan, and then two out of three of those plans eliminate the tax deduction for the vast majority of high-income households.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them defend that. \xc2\xa0But the point is in 2009 and 2011, the President himself proposed limiting the charitable deduction, all kinds of deductions -- as you know, you probably wrote the plans -- for the rich. \xc2\xa0And in 2009, he was asked at a news conference, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this going to decimate charitable giving, and he said, no, we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at it and it won\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0So what\xe2\x80\x99s changed? \xc2\xa0He put that on the table in 2009 to pay for health care and said it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to hurt charities. \xc2\xa0Now Boehner puts it on the table and he says, oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to kill charities.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s changed is a few letters that are quite important -- the difference between limit and eliminate. \xc2\xa0His --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Which do you say they\xe2\x80\x99re going to limit again?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0His plan limits the charitable deduction. \xc2\xa0It does it in a gradual way. \xc2\xa0It does it in a way that we think is completely consistent with charitable giving. \xc2\xa0And, by the way, under his plan you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a 28 percent tax incentive for charitable giving. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what you got under President Reagan when the top tax rate was 28 percent. \xc2\xa0Any Republican that supports a tax plan with 28 percent tax rate, even if they don\xe2\x80\x99t limit tax deductions, that\xe2\x80\x99s the value of tax deduction. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty standard value for tax deductions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the past in this country that people have proposed.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIf you want to get to a trillion dollars on tax expenditures, let alone to the $1.6 trillion, most of the plans we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen eliminated entirely. \xc2\xa0You don\xe2\x80\x99t get 28 percent, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get 15 percent, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get the 12 percent you got in Bowles-Simpson. \xc2\xa0You get zero percent. \xc2\xa0That would have a major impact on charities -- we estimated $10 billion a year using the CBO methodology.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you clarify some of the terms you\xe2\x80\x99re using? \xc2\xa0Because you both referred to what sounds like a two-step plan, but would you lay it out for us -- why are you talking about this in two steps, Jason?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0Yes -- because there is less than a month to go before the end of this year. \xc2\xa0And what the President is not going to do is put in place some type of process that may or may not come up with the revenue. \xc2\xa0We need to lock in a set of revenue right now. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s proposed a very simple way to do it that, by the way, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to require anyone to vote for a tax increase. \xc2\xa0It just requires them to vote to extend the middle-class tax cuts \xc2\xa0-- that gets you a trillion. \xc2\xa0And then you have more time next year to --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, but the first step is Clinton rates.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0Yes, absolutely.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You go up with the Clinton rates. \xc2\xa0And then the second step he said you could --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0The second step would be --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- lower tax rates for everyone.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0The second step would be tax reform. \xc2\xa0And as the President said in an interview the other day, consistent with what he said over the last several years, absolutely try to look [at] could you simplify the tax code, could you make it more fair, could you make it more efficient, could you lower rates -- which is starting from that 39.6 percent rate. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re also starting from a lot of tax expenditures still being out there so you have more scope to do things in tax reform than if you got rid of them all in stage one.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And that would be done next year?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0We had floated the idea of an August 1st deadline for that process because we think that\xe2\x80\x99s the amount of time you\xe2\x80\x99d need.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the Republicans talking about these vague ideas and you want some specifics, are you suggesting that they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to put out there things that would score as revenue now and then get repealed down the line?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0My understanding is that they are saying here is something you could pass this year, that instead of the top rate going to 39.6, we could keep the top rate at 35, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a long, complicated tax reform process, but it would lock in the revenue that you, Mr. President, wants. \xc2\xa0So you want guaranteed revenue, we can do that. \xc2\xa0You want it at a 35 percent rate, we can do that; here, go look, there is some think tank somewhere that has an idea for that. \xc2\xa0We go and look at the think tank and find that two of the three ideas eliminate the charitable deduction.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd a lot of this is just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not characterizing anything in a back-and-forth in negotiations. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying the types of things, different types of people --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you negotiating with them?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0-- these are conversations that are always going on.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yesterday they were?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0Any time someone from there calls, someone from here is going to take that call and have a conversation with them.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They say they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls yesterday.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying whether there was a call yesterday.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I can address this. \xc2\xa0As we\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly, the President is engaged, his team is engaged in broad discussions about how to move this process forward, how to address the fiscal cliff, how to address long-term deficit reduction. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to read out every conversation. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to read out every proposal. \xc2\xa0The fact of the matter is the President has an absolute principle here that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to abandon, which is that rates are going up on top earners. \xc2\xa0And this is not --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you don\xe2\x80\x99t dispute there were no conversations yesterday and there was no exchange of information.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I have no conversations to report, and I can tell you that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to report out to you blow by blow --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Some of you guys are saying you want more detail and then not engaging in the conversation. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s a little --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I had somebody say the day after \xc2\xa0-- and I had just said so publicly the President had spoken on the phone with Speaker Boehner -- or maybe 36 hours, why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the President speaking to Speaker Boehner? \xc2\xa0Well, he has several times. \xc2\xa0He spoke with the numerous lawmakers who were here in the White House several times. \xc2\xa0His team is very engaged in this process.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut here\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to negotiate against ourselves. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to take the flat refusal of Republicans to acknowledge what will happen, which is that rates are going up on top earners, as an incentive to negotiate with ourselves. \xc2\xa0The President has put forward, unlike the Republicans -- contrary to what Ed has said -- the Republicans have not put forward a single sentence that in any way provides some specifics on their proposal on revenue -- not a single specific at all. \xc2\xa0The President has -- and he\xe2\x80\x99s done it on the spending side, too -- he\xe2\x80\x99s provided a substantial specificity when it comes to entitlement savings, both through our health care entitlement programs and other mandatory entitlement programs. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd the goal here -- don\xe2\x80\x99t forget the goal here: \xc2\xa0We focus on revenues. \xc2\xa0The President is engaged in this process because he believes broad-based deficit reduction to the tune of $4 trillion over 10 years is a desirable thing to achieve for the economy, for the American people. \xc2\xa0And he believes that in order to achieve that we need to do that in a balanced way that includes revenue on the order that he\xe2\x80\x99s described.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you saying that before he will actually get in a room and sit down with Boehner and Cantor -- which they asked him to do today -- that they have to cry uncle on rates?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- as much as I understand there\xe2\x80\x99s interest in it -- read out to you our meeting schedules or every communication we have with congressional leaders. \xc2\xa0It is not a point of debate with the President that rates are going up on top earners. \xc2\xa0And I think -- I understand that a lot of Republicans didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him to win reelection and thought he was not going to, and so maybe they weren\xe2\x80\x99t paying close attention, but he was extremely explicit about this every day, as those of you who traveled with us know. \xc2\xa0He did not hide the ball. \xc2\xa0And some people probably thought he was taking some political risk in being very clear with the American people that he believed, as a matter of sound economic policy and fairness, that tax cuts for middle-class Americans, for 98 percent of the American people ought to be extended and that tax rates for the top 2 percent had to go up. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd I think the American people spoke very clearly on this issue on November 6th. \xc2\xa0They very clearly, in the aftermath of November 6th, have expressed to your news organization and to others who have done surveys how they feel about the various proposals that are out there. \xc2\xa0They support the principle that the wealthiest need to pay a little bit more so that the burden of deficit reduction is not borne solely by the middle class or by seniors. \xc2\xa0And the President is going to stick to that principle.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWhen the Republicans are ready to acknowledge that rates are going up, we believe that -- well, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re focused on process. \xc2\xa0We believe that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to have conversations regardless and including conversations that the President just did with business leaders at the Business Roundtable, who have very much at stake here in this process. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to speak with leaders in Washington about this.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut once Republicans acknowledge that rates are going up for top earners, we believe that an agreement is very achievable. \xc2\xa0Why? \xc2\xa0Because unlike Republicans, the President has been very specific on both sides of the equation, both on revenues and on spending cuts. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear that he wants to negotiate with Republicans, that he\xe2\x80\x99s not expecting to get every item in his plan just the way he wants it, and that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be willing to make tough choices. \xc2\xa0But on the matter of the top 2 percent paying higher rates, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to clarify something -- no, not on that, but another subject --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- I know Bill is particularly interested in this and whether or not -- and when the next meeting is. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a schedule to read out to you.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, no, no. \xc2\xa0In answer to Laura\xe2\x80\x99s question, was that a yes?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0No, my answer to that question was conversations will continue, I have no doubt. \xc2\xa0But --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Even before they give up on rates?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, an agreement won\xe2\x80\x99t be reached until they understand that rates have to go up. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I just want to clarify. \xc2\xa0Today you\xe2\x80\x99re saying -- you\xe2\x80\x99re no longer saying the math doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add up. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s politically unfeasible and bad policy. \xc2\xa0Those are two different things.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0No, no, no -- but math isn\xe2\x80\x99t remotely sound. \xc2\xa0And the President, in his first press conference after the election, I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure said something very similar that I\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly seen Jay say something very similar, and to the degree I\xe2\x80\x99ve had conversations with a number of you.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThis is -- during the campaign, there was an argument about a tax plan with a 28 percent rate that would have required a tax increase of $2,000 on middle-class families. \xc2\xa0That argument was about pure mathematics. \xc2\xa0Even if you get rid of 100 percent of everything, it would still require this to work. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tHere our argument is if you want to protect the middle class, if you want to not eliminate the charitable deduction, if you want to not retroactively, entirely eliminate and destroy a several trillion-dollar municipal bond market, then you can\xe2\x80\x99t do this.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I just --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0And those all seem like perfectly reasonable premises to us, and if somebody thinks you should retroactively eliminate the muni market, they should come forward with a proposal.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But when you say you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to talk about process, or process isn\xe2\x80\x99t important, with two weeks left -- or however many weeks -- process does become important. \xc2\xa0And for you to say to Ed, well, we -- you to ask us, we ask you, you go back and ask them, that seems ridiculous. \xc2\xa0Why not call them into a room and say, explain how this works, what are you willing to do, instead of doing this?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0We would love to see -- there is no secret from any conversation that\xe2\x80\x99s happened in any format that we would love to see details of a proposal to limit tax expenditures. \xc2\xa0The only proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s fully fleshed out, fully scored, fully worked out, is the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a good proposal. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t raise enough revenue for what we need to bring the debt down.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you going to ask them for the details?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0Absolutely, we\xe2\x80\x99ve consistently asked for details. \xc2\xa0And what we generally get referred to is a paper by the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re an excellent think tank. \xc2\xa0Things that think tanks do have all sorts of interesting ideas. \xc2\xa0They tend -- all think tanks -- to not be the same degree of rigor and analysis, that something would go through if it went through the official resources that Congress has at its disposal through the Joint Committee on Taxation that we have at our disposal through the Treasury and the White House.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWhen you put proposals through things like that, you discover things like having these types of cliffs doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. \xc2\xa0You discover how many people lose their -- you discover all that. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important to see something real. \xc2\xa0Again, I have no doubt you can have a sound proposal that raises hundreds of billions of dollars. \xc2\xa0To raise $1.6 trillion, to raise even the $1 trillion that we\xe2\x80\x99re calling for out of decoupling, we don\xe2\x80\x99t see something plausible or desirable without rates going up.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What is the meaningful revenue target that you are aiming for? \xc2\xa0The President today said at the BRT, \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is a bottom line amount of revenue that is required in order for us to get a real, meaningful deficit reduction plan that hits the numbers for us to stabilize our debt.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0He said that in two different forums. \xc2\xa0So what is the target? \xc2\xa0It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Jay negotiates the details with you all every day, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what he brought me here for. \xc2\xa0We have $1.6 trillion in our budget; $950 [billion] is what you\xe2\x80\x99d lock in through decoupling right away. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get to $4 trillion in total. \xc2\xa0Those are all some of our touchstones. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut obviously the President said he\xe2\x80\x99s open to other ideas. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s open to compromise. \xc2\xa0But even that $950 billion -- and that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be enough -- but even that $950 billion you can\xe2\x80\x99t get through a plausible, desirable tax reform that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t raise rates in a format that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Can I just say -- I just want to make the point here that -- two points. \xc2\xa0One, this is a discussion about a broad-based deficit reduction package that the President seeks. \xc2\xa0Republicans should -- I think it would be helpful -- engage in this process because the process envisions $4 trillion in deficit reduction. \xc2\xa0This is not just about the revenue figure. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut the obstacle continues to be an adamant refusal by Republican leaders to this point to accept the premise that rates need to go up on the wealthiest 2 percent, and the willingness to do all sorts of other things. \xc2\xa0Last summer it was default on the full faith and credit of the United States; this year it\xe2\x80\x99s allow taxes to go up on middle-class families, all for the sake of protecting tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires -- tax breaks that the overwhelming majority of the American people do not believe we can afford, do not believe are good economic policy. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd so, as Jason has been making clear, if the Republicans believe that they have an alternative proposal that achieves the kind of revenue that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, they ought to put it on paper. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd I think the reason they haven\xe2\x80\x99t is because they know, as Jason has just explained, that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a plausible proposal that produces the amount of revenue necessary that could pass Congress or that makes economic sense. \xc2\xa0So rates are going to go up on the top 2 percent, and we look forward to Republican leaders agreeing with every day more and more of their colleagues, every day more and more business leaders who have made the statement publicly that we need to get this done, we need to acknowledge that rates are going up, and that a lot of the arguments Republicans have traditionally put forward about why we can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly ask the wealthiest 2 percent to pay top marginal rates at the level that they paid under Clinton are spurious. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI think the CEO of FedEx said as much recently. \xc2\xa0Senator Coburn has said so, Senator Snowe, Representative Cole. \xc2\xa0The FedEx Chairman and CEO, Fred Smith, said I think just the other day that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of mythology in Washington, and among that mythology is that if you raise the rates on the top 2 percent you\xe2\x80\x99ll kill jobs. \xc2\xa0We know that\xe2\x80\x99s not true because those were the rates that were in place in the 1990s when this economy created more jobs than we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen created in that period of time in our lifetimes. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we believe that, despite obvious resistance to what has to be the framework of a deal here, that progress is being made and that a compromise is possible, a way to reach an agreement is possible. \xc2\xa0But it requires some seriousness by Republican leaders on this very important issue.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Kristen.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, thanks. \xc2\xa0The President gave a warning today to Republicans that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use the debt limit as a bargaining chip if the bulk of this work goes past the January 1st deadline. \xc2\xa0Realistically, is there anything that he could do or that he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to do to stop it from happening?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The President made clear today at the Business Roundtable that he will not engage in that kind of gamesmanship with Republicans. \xc2\xa0We are highly skeptical that Republican leaders believe it would be wise as a matter of economic policy or political strategy to hold the American and global economy hostage again for the sake of tax cuts for wealthy Americans, a position that is wildly unpopular in the United States and among the very constituents that sent members of Congress to Washington. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIt is wildly irresponsible to suggest that that is the appropriate approach to take. \xc2\xa0It is simply Congress\xe2\x80\x99s duty to pay its bills, to pay for the expenses that Congress itself authorized. \xc2\xa0And we expect Congress to take action. \xc2\xa0The President is absolutely firm on this. \xc2\xa0Congress needs to act without drama, without delay, to ensure that we do not default. \xc2\xa0It would be wildly irresponsible to do otherwise.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you say you were engaged. \xc2\xa0Does that suggest that you would consider raising the debt limit unilaterally? \xc2\xa0I know that that was something that was discussed in 2011.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I just think it\xe2\x80\x99s highly unlikely that Republicans would want to go down that road again. \xc2\xa0Not only was what happened in the summer of 2011 terrible for the American economy, terrible for the American middle class, terrible for American business, it was terrible for the Republican Party. \xc2\xa0It was bad politics. \xc2\xa0I believe it was shortly after that debacle that public approval ratings of Congress dipped into the single digits. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo putting aside doing the right thing, putting aside wise economic policy, putting aside the idea that you should put the country and the economy first, as pure politics, it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem plausible to me that they would want to travel that road.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But they maintained their majority, right? \xc2\xa0I mean, this is the argument we have with them all the time, and they say, look, 12 percent and we got reelected with that. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand why you guys are so convinced that there\xe2\x80\x99s political pressure bearing down on them when they\xe2\x80\x99ve retained their majority.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I think you have heard and seen public statements by business leaders, some of -- or many of whom are not necessarily natural allies of the Democratic Party or the President of the United States, who are extremely alarmed by that kind of talk being put forward by some Republicans in Congress. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen any Republican leaders embrace that strategy. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s funny because some of who are apparently suggesting this to the press describe it as a doomsday strategy, which is ironic indeed because the doom would befall the country and the economy, and does not seem like wise politics.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, some government agencies are saying that they are being asked by the White House to prepare for sequestration cuts. \xc2\xa0Is this a government-wide directive? \xc2\xa0Can you talk more about that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I can and I will. \xc2\xa0The administration remains focused on reaching agreement as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing on a balanced deficit reduction plan that avoids sequestration. \xc2\xa0Leaders of both parties have pledged to work together in the coming weeks, and we are confident, as I just said, that we can reach an agreement.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tHowever, with less than one month left before a potential sequestration order would have to be issued, the Office of Management and Budget must take certain steps to ensure the administration is ready to issue such an order should Congress fail to act.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tEarlier this week, OMB issued a request to federal agencies for additional information, to finalize calculations on the spending reductions that would be required. \xc2\xa0This action should not be read -- to anticipate your next question -- as a change in the administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to reach an agreement and avoid sequestration. \xc2\xa0OMB is simply ensuring that the administration is prepared, should it become necessary to issue such an order. \xc2\xa0OMB will continue to consult with agencies and will provide additional guidance as needed. \xc2\xa0This is just acting responsibly because of the potential for this happening.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Should companies put out layoff notices then? \xc2\xa0Because before the election, companies were being told, don\xe2\x80\x99t put out layoff notices to scare people. \xc2\xa0If the administration is now doing this, should people be notified about potential layoffs?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, again, we believe firmly that a deal is possible. \xc2\xa0I think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen again and again in recent days Republicans agreeing with the principle that we ought to extend tax cuts for the middle class. \xc2\xa0That alone, by passing the Senate bill, would mitigate a substantial portion of the so-called fiscal cliff. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tObviously, there would be more work to do. \xc2\xa0But taking that action would, as I said earlier, overcome what seems to be the largest obstacle to a near-term agreement and the first stage of what would be a two-stage agreement that would ensure that rates went up for the top 2 percent, that that revenue would be locked in, commitments for spending cuts would be in place, and commitments to engage in a process of both tax reform and entitlement reform would be in place.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd I think that this is an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to do something very significant, do something important that represents goals that this President has and that Republican leaders have, which is to put our economy on sounder fiscal footing and do it in a way that helps the -- that allows the economy to continue to grow and create jobs.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask you a question not about the --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We spent a lot of time here. \xc2\xa0I\'ll make it to Peter. \xc2\xa0I\'ll come back this way.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I get that you think that the idea of using the debt ceiling is a bad idea, bad politics, and all that. \xc2\xa0What is the last view today, though, of the 14th Amendment argument? \xc2\xa0Is there a constitutional power vested in the President to do this by executive authority as far as you all are concerned?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I have no update on that view. \xc2\xa0I\'d refer you to the questions I answered about this back at the time. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You said at the time there wasn\'t enough time to know. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\'m not sure that\'s what I said, but I will ask you to refresh your memory and I will refresh mine. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, let me follow that question up by asking if you and the team think it is so unlikely that the Republicans are going to go down that road again, why did the President feel compelled to be so explicit and vehement about this?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Because we have seen some inclinations by some Republicans again -- as far as I know, disavowed by leaders -- to engage in that game again. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaker Boehner did say if you guys want to increase the debt limit, there will be a price for it. \xc2\xa0I assume that\'s what the President was talking about.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think I said very explicitly in response to that -- and I speak for the President -- that to do so, to demand a political price for Congress to do its job responsibly, which is to ensure that the United States of America pays its bills, would be wildly irresponsible. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you are taking that threat seriously.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, we have to prepare. \xc2\xa0We have to answer questions and state clearly what our views on this are. \xc2\xa0I don\'t believe in the end that Republicans want to do that, not because we\'re telling them it\'s a bad idea, but because doing great harm to the American economy, doing great harm to American business does not seem like a step that they would want to take, especially when you have a process in place here and an opportunity to work with this President to lock in substantial savings, to lock in substantial deficit reduction, and to do so in a way that is balanced and fair. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd that\'s where we are today. \xc2\xa0Some of the ideas that have been floated about engaging in this process suggest that Republicans would simply vote to extend middle-class tax cuts, let the Clinton-era rates rise for the high-wage earners, and then engage in debt ceiling brinkmanship. \xc2\xa0And one has to ask, since the reason why they would do that as opposed to reach a deal now is because they oppose letting the rates go up doesn\'t make a lot of sense to me strategically.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Here\'s what you said last time. \xc2\xa0You said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can have an esoteric --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0That was very fast. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cYou can have an esoteric discussion about constitutional law and what could or should not be, but we don\'t have the luxury or the time. \xc2\xa0The law is as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0You didn\'t have time then. \xc2\xa0It\'s been a year. \xc2\xa0Is there any study that\xe2\x80\x99s been done by the administration since then?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Not that I\'m aware of. \xc2\xa0So what I said then stands to this day. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it theoretically possible that you could get a solution in the short term where the rates go up, but not all the way to 39.6, and you can -- by limited capping of deductions, you could make up the revenue you need without doing full-scale tax reforms?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0I mean, the President has been clear that rates need to go up. \xc2\xa0The President has been clear that there is a plan that works extremely well, which is to let those rates go back up to the Clinton rates and then do additional tax reform on top of that. \xc2\xa0It\'s important not just that you\'re trying to replace the revenue from decoupling, but you\'re putting yourself in a position where there\'s still scope to do tax reform.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo you wouldn\'t want to do something where any additional tax reform, the only tax expenditures left, would be those for the middle class. \xc2\xa0So what tax reform became was an exercise in raising taxes on the middle class, because that\'s not something we\'d want to do. \xc2\xa0It\'s not something that Congress would want to do. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut the President has always said -- wants to hear ideas, engage in a discussion of those ideas. \xc2\xa0But whether you could design any of those in a way that again meets that plausible, desirable leaving room for the type of tax reform that we think we need to do as a country, do that all in the next couple of weeks, is something that we haven\'t seen.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Can I get one more for Jason? \xc2\xa0I\'m going to let him go and then stay if you have questions on other subjects. \xc2\xa0Anybody have -- for Jason?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I was curious. \xc2\xa0This is more of a question for Jay, but going back to the -- sorry. \xc2\xa0But going back to the summer of last year and the $1.2 million that the President agreed that you could raise without increasing the rates, was there anything that was different? \xc2\xa0I mean, did he really think at that time that you could have tax reform in an election year? \xc2\xa0It seemed very -- that we would be back here at the same place we are right now with the Bush-era tax cuts ready to expire -- because it\'s an election year and we all know in Washington that a lot doesn\'t go on, \xc2\xa0and tax reform is a big thing to take on. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0I think two things. \xc2\xa0One is that there are two sets of issues when you have to do tax reform. \xc2\xa0One is some of the most controversial issues about how much revenue, what the distribution of that revenue is. \xc2\xa0And then, a second set of things that are also really complicated and controversial about how you put that whole plan together. \xc2\xa0The goal of those talks was to try to settle some of the biggest, most controversial questions in stage one so that stage two would have become a more technical exercise, admittedly an incredibly fraught and incredibly political, and incredibly complicated one, but one that some of the very biggest questions had been settled at the leadership level.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd two, the President\'s attitude has always been that he wants to get done the things that we need to get done in this country. \xc2\xa0And if Republicans were willing to do tax reform in the year 2012 that would have raised revenue, he absolutely would have been willing and thrilled to do that with them. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why he was engaged in those negotiations. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s gotten until now to the point where you have any indication of a willingness to --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was he kicking it down the road, though, the tax reform part, to see who won the election and then whoever gets the leverage?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0I mean, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t -- Speaker Boehner was the one that withdrew from those talks, not President Obama. \xc2\xa0President Obama went the extra mile to try to make those talks succeed, because he thought it was important for the economy and important for our long-term economic growth. \xc2\xa0So --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When you say the \xe2\x80\x9cextra mile,\xe2\x80\x9d do you mean moving the goal post the extra mile? \xc2\xa0Because that\xe2\x80\x99s how they --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0Absolutely not. \xc2\xa0I mean, Hans, he was --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, we can get into this dispute on where the numbers were and how close they were.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- there\xe2\x80\x99s like a lot of history books one can already start reading about last summer, and I personally have avoided reading any of them. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve always been clear -- I mean, our central things have been the amount of debt reduction we need to get the debt on a downward slope have been protecting the middle class -- households that make up to $250,000 a year; have been a balanced plan in which revenue is making a meaningful contribution. \xc2\xa0Those were consistent when the President ran in 2008. \xc2\xa0They were consistent in the talks last time. \xc2\xa0They were consistent in this campaign. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s where he\xe2\x80\x99s approaching it from now.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The only thing that\xe2\x80\x99s changed is that you all have won the election and there\xe2\x80\x99s a dynamic that\xe2\x80\x99s changed. \xc2\xa0So are you saying that now the President has the political capital and a mandate to raise the taxes right now?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0First of all, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Jay answer questions of that nature. \xc2\xa0But let me also say we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot of work in the last year. \xc2\xa0We didn\xe2\x80\x99t just sort of sit here twiddling our thumbs. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve known that we were going to be in this type of conversation in November and December. \xc2\xa0So just at a purely analytical level, we know more about tax reform. \xc2\xa0We know more about tax expenditures. \xc2\xa0We know more about all of those topics now than we\xe2\x80\x99ve known before. \xc2\xa0And all of that understanding, all of the types of math I walked you through inform the positions the President has taken. \xc2\xa0And the positions he\xe2\x80\x99s taken are we need $4 trillion, we need balance, we need this amount of revenue. \xc2\xa0And then, you do a bunch of math and you spend a bunch of time on it, and it turns out you don\xe2\x80\x99t see a way to get that without higher rates.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to belabor this, but are you saying that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know some of the things you know now, that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t back then that you know now?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not that saying that now. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying I\xe2\x80\x99m giving you -- first of all, as I said then, there was always this structure that if tax reform didn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed -- and one of the ways it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have succeeded is if it raised taxes on the middle class or eliminated the charitable deduction -- that as of January 1st, 2013, the top rates would have reverted to what they were in the Clinton era. \xc2\xa0So that was built into the agreement then. \xc2\xa0There was time to explore something else.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNow we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about trying to pass that something else in the next month. \xc2\xa0Everything we know about what it would mean to pass that something else in the next month tells us that it can\'t plausibly be done without higher rates. \xc2\xa0Every argument to the contrary has had flaws in it -- very, very serious flaws, like eliminating completely the charitable deduction. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re still open for hearing more of those ideas. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not very optimistic that somebody is going to come up with some, because we have, as I said, looked at this even more over the course of the past year. \xc2\xa0But of course we\xe2\x80\x99re always open to hearing ideas.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Really quickly, one more. \xc2\xa0Last one.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In your studies, and you said you looked at over the course of the last year since the last time we went through these negotiations -- the last time we went through these negotiations the President was open to the so-called chained CPI of Social Security. \xc2\xa0What has changed -- or, I mean, is Social Security in better shape now than it was a year and a half ago? \xc2\xa0Why is the President taking it off the table? \xc2\xa0What has changed other than the political calculation?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. FURMAN: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Jay answer a certain amount to that. \xc2\xa0But in a negotiation there is always a give-and- take. \xc2\xa0And right after those negotiations ended the President put out his plan for the super committee, which if the super committee had adopted would have averted all of these problems. \xc2\xa0His plan for the super committee reflected where he\xe2\x80\x99s coming from, what he thinks are the best policies to move this country forward, protect the middle class. \xc2\xa0That plan did not include superlative CPI or H67 for Medicare. \xc2\xa0And that was in September of last year that that was put forward.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0And if I could just, Mike, just add that the President has made clear what his -- the way that he would achieve health care entitlement savings to the tune of -- well, total entitlement savings, additional $600 billion, a substantial portion of that from health care entitlements. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s in his plan. \xc2\xa0And he has made clear that when it comes to spending cuts and further savings, he understands that he would be negotiating with Congress and is open to other ideas, and is willing to make tough choices. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifically what would or wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be part of that discussion, but it is certainly the case that the President recognizes that that would be a negotiation, and that it would require tough choices by both sides.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWhat I would note, however, is that the President has put forward, in detail, specific entitlement savings, and we have not seen that yet -- at least not to the same level of specificity -- from the Republicans. \xc2\xa0I would also note that on the two measures that you talked about, they alone raise -- would save far less than what the President has proposed in that 10-year window. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo the President is serious about it. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s serious about balance in his approach. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s serious about the goal of attaining, when you combine everything together, deficit reduction, long-term, to the tune of $4 trillion, and that requires tough choices by everyone. \xc2\xa0The tough choice that we have not yet seen from the Republican Party is, at least at the leadership level, the acknowledgment that rates have to go up in order to achieve the revenue levels, as Jason has so amply laid out, that are required for a balanced package.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- slight adjustment that Social Security could be in the second step that you were discussing with Jessica earlier?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Let me let Jason go. \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0I know he has meetings and stuff. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll attempt to answer questions on this subject even in his absence. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. \xc2\xa0Go ahead.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jessica -- you and Jessica were talking earlier about the two-step process. \xc2\xa0It could be back on the table, this adjustment to Social Security in the second step.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Entitlement reforms would explicitly be on the table, and --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But not just Medicare and Medicaid, but also Social Security?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s back up. \xc2\xa0On Social Security, we have said that, when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about deficit reduction, what economists acknowledge, which is that Social Security is not a driver of our deficits. \xc2\xa0And having said that, the President has always expressed interest in working with Congress to take steps to further strengthen Social Security because it\xe2\x80\x99s such a vital program for our senior citizens and it needs to be in place for generations to come. \xc2\xa0And he has been willing, and is willing, to have those conversations on a separate track, but it is not the case that Social Security is a driver of the deficits that we are trying to address through a long-term deficit reduction package. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So wait, you talk about them at the same time so long as they are not on the same track?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- we did go through this a little bit back in 2011, and our position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed. \xc2\xa0As a matter of economic fact, Social Security does not -- is not a driver of our deficits. \xc2\xa0Health care entitlements certainly are -- Medicare and Medicaid. \xc2\xa0Tax expenditures and a lack of revenue from high-income Americans is certainly a factor, and those are issues that would be addressed in the package that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut the President is very interested, as he\xe2\x80\x99s always said, in having conversations and working on proposals that would strengthen Social Security for the long term.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tJake.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to change the subject for a second, what qualities does the President look for when he\xe2\x80\x99s going to pick an ambassador? \xc2\xa0Especially to an important ally like France -- France or the U.K.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Someone very well dressed. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I anticipated the question you\xe2\x80\x99re asking, and I can tell you in advance -- I will answer the question, but that I have no personnel announcements. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to engage in speculation about possible personnel announcements. \xc2\xa0I think that the President, in all of his personnel appointments, looks for talent, wisdom and character in his appointees, and he would do that regardless of the position.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it important for a diplomat to be diplomatic?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0One of the -- (laughter) -- I mean, another way of addressing that is to answer the question that there have been enormously effective diplomats in this country\xe2\x80\x99s history who have not necessarily risen through the diplomatic corps. \xc2\xa0Now, we have enormously talented --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, just even in their personal lives, or pop culture, you are --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I understand that that\xe2\x80\x99s a rhetorical question, and diplomacy is effectively performed by diplomats. \xc2\xa0But we had one of the greatest diplomats of his generation pass away not long ago -- Richard Holbrooke -- and I think everyone who knew him or who sat across the table from him would agree that he was not by anyone\xe2\x80\x99s traditional definition particularly diplomatic.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, but he was also a brilliant negotiator and --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0So they come in all types and sizes and approaches.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President seen \xe2\x80\x9cThe Devil Wears Prada\xe2\x80\x9d? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Before we go to -- question, you don\xe2\x80\x99t deny that Anna Wintour can become ambassador from the United States --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I will not engage in any speculation about personnel announcements. \xc2\xa0I just won\xe2\x80\x99t.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what\xe2\x80\x99s your -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction to the situation in Egypt at this moment?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a broad question that I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to address. \xc2\xa0As you know, we remain concerned with the continuing lack of consensus regarding the recent constitutional declarations and the handling of the draft constitution in Egypt. \xc2\xa0As Secretary Clinton said earlier today, the current situation in Egypt indicates that dialogue between all Egyptians is urgently needed and that it must be a two-way dialogue that includes a respectful exchange of the concerns of the Egyptian people themselves about their constitutional process and the substance of their constitution. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe Egyptian people want and deserve a constitutional process that is open, transparent and fair, and does not unduly favor one group over any other. \xc2\xa0Democracy depends on strong institutions and the important checks and balances that provide accountability. \xc2\xa0We would note the demonstrations supporting both sides of the issues so far have been large and generally peaceful. \xc2\xa0As Egyptians continue to express their views, we look to the government of Egypt to respect the freedoms of peaceful expression and assembly, and to exercise restraint. \xc2\xa0We also continue to call on demonstrators and political parties to take all possible measures to avoid confrontation and violence.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe encourage the implementation of a constitution that is seen as legitimate by a broad cross section of the Egyptian people, across the political spectrum, and that upholds Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s international human rights commitments, including respect for the rights of women, minorities, and Egyptians of all faiths.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President fully support President Morsi?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, the President has an important relationship -- well, the United States has a very important relationship with Egypt. \xc2\xa0The President has worked effectively with President Morsi on key issues, including recently the negotiated ceasefire in Gaza. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe are monitoring the situation, as I just discussed, in Egypt, and we call on all sides to allow for a peaceful process and to pursue a result that is a constitution that both reflects the will of the Egyptian people and upholds Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s international human rights responsibilities and commitments, including respect for the rights of women, minorities, and Egyptians of all faiths.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tLeslie.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has President Obama called President Morsi, or does he plan to?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I follow up on that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I have no foreign leader calls to read out.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I follow up on that? \xc2\xa0Can you talk about -- has the December 17th visit by President Morsi been postponed, delayed, changed?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information to provide to you about a foreign leader visit at this time.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is he still coming?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on that for you.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, today The New York Times reported that the White House or the President was going to request from Congress $45 billion to $55 billion in disaster relief money. \xc2\xa0Is that report accurate?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I can tell you that the administration has already obligated more than $2.3 billion to support response and recovery efforts. \xc2\xa0The administration is working closely with our partners in the states and in Congress, and is in the process of developing a request for a supplemental. \xc2\xa0But that process has not been completed and it would be premature to speculate on a specific number or even on a numerical range.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Should there be offsets to pay for that, or would that add to the deficit?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of this process. \xc2\xa0I would anticipate that we would get a request up this week, and we can certainly discuss it further then.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYes, in the back.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On immigration, what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction to the surprising participation of former President Bush in the debate between Republicans on immigration?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a White House reaction beyond noting what I have in the past, which is that President George W. Bush supported comprehensive immigration reform, both as Governor and as President. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s something that President Obama notes ruefully, which is that in the past there had been leading Republicans who supported comprehensive immigration reform, including President Bush, including Senator McCain, who coauthored legislation that would have achieved that with Senator Kennedy, and that he hopes and anticipates that we will see Republican leaders -- elected leaders in Congress look to engage in that process because he believes that comprehensive immigration reform is very important. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s important for our economy and it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously important for very many people in a community that has been looking to Washington to act on this important issue.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Talking about Senator McCain, why do you think he has been changing his position on immigration?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I would have to direct you to Senator McCain.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, I want to go back to something we haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked about for a while. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been a renewed call for President Obama to issue that executive order barring federal contractors from discriminating against LGBT workers. \xc2\xa0Over the weekend, Steve Elmendorf, one of his prominent supporters in the election, said he\xe2\x80\x99s -- the first six months -- first six months of next year. \xc2\xa0Will President Obama revisit this idea as he begins his second term?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Our position on that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed, and we point to, as you and I have discussed, the process that led to the effective repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d as a model for the way to approach these issues. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you on our approach. \xc2\xa0The President supports an inclusive ENDA that would provide lasting and comprehensive protections for LGBT people across the country, regardless of whether they happen to work for a government contractor. \xc2\xa0And we look forward to continuing to support that process and that legislation.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So does that rule out the possibility of that order happening in the first six months of next year?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on a hypothetical situation. \xc2\xa0I would simply point to what our position has been on the avenue that we believe is the best to pursue broad-based protections for LGBT people.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Given that Republicans still control Congress, though, after Election Day, isn\xe2\x80\x99t leaving this up to the legislative process -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t that condemning LGBT people who have no federal --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Many people say just that, even though it was in the prior Congress, about repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And we believe that the country has moved dramatically on issues like this, and that this President is committed to civil rights and to building on the protections that are necessary for LGBT people, as he is for all Americans.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One last question on this. \xc2\xa0President Obama --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think you may have gotten all I can give.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0President Obama in May said, when he endorsed marriage equality, that he had spoken with servicemembers who were discharged under \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d and he had spoken with same-sex couples who were looking to marry. \xc2\xa0Has he ever spoken to a victim of LGBT workplace discrimination?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he has or hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have a conversation to read out to you.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you get back to me on that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to ask him about every conversation he\xe2\x80\x99s had.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tDonovan.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, there are reports out of Syria that the rebels are making advances, but part of those advances are being aided by militias, some of which have suspected ties to al Qaeda. \xc2\xa0What is the administration doing to make sure that those types of groups do not take over or pose a danger to the U.S. going forward, or even to the Syrian people?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, as you know, Donovan, it\xe2\x80\x99s long been our position to work with our international partners to support the Syrian opposition, and in supporting the Syrian opposition, to support those groups that are committed to a more democratic future for Syria. \xc2\xa0And we are, of course, mindful of the fact that not all elements of the opposition share those democratic aspirations or share the kinds of universal values that we support and try to advance in connection with the work that our partners do.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe are monitoring the situation in Syria very closely at many levels, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked recently yesterday about disposition of chemical weapons. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the fact that the opposition has made advances and our concern that the Assad regime out of desperation would make the extremely foolhardy decision to attempt to use chemical weapons, and we have warned strongly against that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe continue to work with our partners to support the opposition and support those elements of the opposition that we believe have Syria\xe2\x80\x99s and -- the best interest of Syria and Syrians at heart, and who aspire to a more inclusive and democratic country.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any effort to encourage them not to include al Qaeda in that? \xc2\xa0Or how -- it seems like a --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Oh, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re very clear in expressing our views about who we believe has the best interests of the Syrian people in mind and who -- when we talk about working with the opposition, we work with members of the opposition and groups within the opposition now as well as the Syrian opposition group that has been formed that commit themselves to a brighter and more democratic future for Syria and the Syrian people.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThanks, guys.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tEND</div>\n<div>\n\t1:47 P.M.
