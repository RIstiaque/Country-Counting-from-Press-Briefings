Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:54 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements at the top, so let\xe2\x80\x99s go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>Julie, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to start with trade.\xc2\xa0 The President is doing this round of interviews today, and it looks like the areas where he\xe2\x80\x99s doing these interviews are areas where House Democrats have already said that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to support TPA.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the point of the interviews is to give cover and give support to these Democrats who are already with him.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that keen political observation is true in some instances but not in all of them.\xc2\xa0 Some of these are places where there are members of Congress who have not yet publicly committed to supporting trade legislation.</p>\n<p>More broadly, the goal of these interviews is actually to make the case in these communities that passing the most progressive trade promotion authority that the Senate has ever passed would expand significantly economic opportunity for middle-class families not just in those communities, but also all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And that, ultimately, is the case that we want to make.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s also the case that the President will make in the interview that he conducts with Kai Rysdall from Marketplace in NPR.</p>\n<p>So this is a broad-based case that we\xe2\x80\x99re making here, and it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the case that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President make for weeks.\xc2\xa0 And based on the success that we had in convincing nearly a third of the Democrats in the Senate to support this legislation, we\xe2\x80\x99re optimistic that we have the opportunity to make that case to progressives across the country and to Democrats in the House of Representatives, and we can give them a reason to support this bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an assessment on where you think you stand with House Democrats?\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something like 17 have said publicly that they are going to vote for TPA.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated whip count for you, but I can confirm that the President is continuing to personally involve himself in conversations with members of the House of Representatives about why they should -- making the case about why they should support this bill.\xc2\xa0 And again, the case that he\xe2\x80\x99s making in private is entirely consistent with the argument that he\xe2\x80\x99s made publicly about the economic benefits for middle-class families associated with this legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this debate on the Hill is not just being watched in the U.S., it\xe2\x80\x99s also being watched abroad, in the Asia Pacific, but also in Europe with a lot of the leaders that the President is going to be meeting with this weekend, who work on a transatlantic trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 When he has conversations with these leaders Sunday and Monday, is he going to be able to assure them that he has the votes in the House to be able to move forward on TPA?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, he will make the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ve built important bipartisan support in the Senate for this approach, and we continue to be confident --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re going to want to know what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the House.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll project confidence that I previously expressed, that we can build a similar bipartisan majority in the House, as well.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still work to be done on that, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you with the impression that that work has been completed; there\xe2\x80\x99s still important work to be done.</p>\n<p>But what\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that when we have an opportunity to make the case to people who are willing to keep an open mind about the benefits of this legislation, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had some success in winning support for the bill.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to use that approach in making the case to Democrats in the House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, I know yesterday when you were up here, Sepp Blatter had just said that he went to resign, and you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment on it yesterday because it had just happened.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if now you may have on a comment on his plans.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would just say more broadly is obviously this is an organization that is responsible for managing the affairs of a sport that is closely followed by literally billions of people across the globe.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s apparent from recent news reports that they\xe2\x80\x99d benefit from some new leadership.\xc2\xa0 And so this is an opportunity for that organization to try to improve their public image and to make sure that the actions of that organization are consistent with their mission.\xc2\xa0 But obviously those kinds of decisions will have to be made by the members of the organization.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I say all of that without any special knowledge about the ongoing Department of Justice investigation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the prosecutors at the Department of Justice will carry out their work irrespective of any personnel decisions made at FIFA.</p>\n<p>Julia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Josh, how is the White House preparing for the upcoming Supreme Court decision on King-Burwell?\xc2\xa0 Is there any kind of contingency plans being worked out for people who might lose their health care subsidies?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julia, what we have made clear is that we continue to be very confident in the legal case that was presented by the Solicitor General before the Court earlier this year.\xc2\xa0 What is absolutely clear from any impartial reading of the legislation -- and this is something that has been confirmed by Republican staffers who worked on the bill -- is that there was not a specific intent by members of Congress to make the citizens of those states that use the federal government to establish their exchange ineligible for subsidies.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the goal of the legislation was to make sure that everyone, regardless of which state they lived in, [was] eligible for subsidies based solely on their income, not which state they lived in.</p>\n<p>And the fact is that this policy, as it\xe2\x80\x99s been implemented over the last several years, has lowered health care costs for millions of people across the country.\xc2\xa0 And in some cases -- in many cases, millions of cases -- has allowed people who previously could not afford health insurance to be able to purchase it.\xc2\xa0 And that has provided significant economic benefits for the country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s had a positive impact on the fiscal situation in this country.\xc2\xa0 And most importantly, it\xe2\x80\x99s made a difference in the lives of millions of people who now no longer have to worry that they\'re just one illness away from bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if the Court rules that the federal government can\'t provide these subsidies in states where the states won\xe2\x80\x99t pay for them, that would undo a significant part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s health care legislation.\xc2\xa0 Are you just so confident in the legal case that there are no contingency plans being considered, should a ruling like that occur?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is true that we continue to be very confident in the legal case that we have to make.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that if the Supreme Court were to throw the health care system in this country into utter chaos, there would be no easy solutions for solving the problem, principally because it would require an act -- likely require an act of Congress in order to address that situation.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen much of an appetite from Republicans in Congress to working constructively to address this question.</p>\n<p>The fact is we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many Republicans be very willing to try to play politics in a rather cynical way on this issue, but not a lot of constructive engagement to solve problems.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So hopefully we\'re not going to have to -- that will not be an eventuality that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to consider.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of Republicans on the Hill, John Cornyn yesterday said that the Senate might not consider reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank until July, which would pass its June 30th deadline.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s response to this?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House doing to push Congress to act faster on the Export-Import Bank expiration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we continue to believe that the Export-Import Bank does important things for the American economy.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of supporting American jobs over the last six years, work at the bank has supported 1.3 million private sector jobs inside the United States.\xc2\xa0 That\'s 164,000 jobs in Fiscal Year 2014 alone.\xc2\xa0 That positive impact on our economy and that positive impact on job creation is why we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Democratic and Republican Presidents throughout history aggressively advocate for the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.</p>\n<p>That includes President Reagan, who signed legislation reauthorizing the bank, and praised the bank on the occasion of its 50th anniversary back in 1984 when he said that, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Export-Import Bank contributes in a significant way to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s export sales.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And the other thing that we have learned -- and this has been a part of the argument that we have made about the benefits associated with trade legislation -- is we know that American jobs that are tied to exports, on average pay substantially higher than the average American job.\xc2\xa0 And so creating more jobs that are tied to exports means that we need to open up opportunities overseas for American goods and services.</p>\n<p>And obviously trade legislation and a trade agreement in the Asia Pacific would further that goal.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s also important work that goes on every day at the Export-Import Bank that does that, as well.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Congress not to prevent the charter of the Export-Import Bank from lapsing.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, not every Republican agrees with Senator Cornyn.\xc2\xa0 And there are Republicans who agree with the President\xe2\x80\x99s stated position about the benefits of the Export-Import Bank.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re hopeful that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to build the bipartisan majority that\'s necessary to prevent a lapse in the Export-Import Bank\xe2\x80\x99s funding.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also on the economy and the numbers that you just mentioned -- I mean, it seems like you, the President, the entire administration has been very vocal for the past year on numbers on the economy -- how much that has stabilized, the progress, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 But then there\xe2\x80\x99s this interesting poll that just comes out today -- a CNN/ORC poll -- showing that only 40 percent of those who responded now think that things are going well in this country.</p>\n<p>And the approval ratings for the President are also down, even since March.\xc2\xa0 So it almost seems like as things stabilize and as that message is hammered out there, you see this strange shift in numbers in the opposite direction.\xc2\xa0 You just can\xe2\x80\x99t help but look at that with some interest.\xc2\xa0 What is your take on that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there anything that you would attribute a shift like that to?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, presumably, CNN has hired very highly paid analysts to review the results of the poll, and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we would rather hear from you since you\xe2\x80\x99re here now.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 I probably won\xe2\x80\x99t get paid as much as the highly paid analysts, but --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You could have someone --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the burdens, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly right.\xc2\xa0 Exactly right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it has to be something that you see and you notice, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would say that I notice it principally because I expected somebody to ask about it today, not necessarily because I found it to be particularly interesting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But let me just say as a general matter that the President believes that there is a strong case for us to make, looking at the data, about the significant progress that our economy has made since the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>That said, the President believes that there is substantially more work that needs to be done to strengthen our economy and further expand economic opportunity for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is aggressively pursuing trade legislation that he believes would create jobs and expand economic opportunity.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s why the President continues to believe, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me talk about even in the last couple of weeks about how much we would like to see Congress take action to reform our tax code and use some of that revenue to invest in infrastructure that we all benefit from.\xc2\xa0 Those kinds of significant commitments to infrastructure would create jobs in the short term, but also would lay a foundation for long-term economic strength in this country.</p>\n<p>So there are additional things that we can do and that would have corresponding impact on the metrics that measure the size and health of our economy.\xc2\xa0 And presumably, that would have a corresponding impact on the President\xe2\x80\x99s poll numbers; but frankly, those numbers are a lot less important.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the largest disapproval numbers that you see is in the President\xe2\x80\x99s handling of fighting ISIS.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that that contributes to the overall drop?\xc2\xa0 Or what is your reaction to so many Americans -- at least according to this poll -- saying that they feel that that\xe2\x80\x99s an area that\xe2\x80\x99s going pretty badly?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about quite a bit also over the last couple of weeks, that there are areas where we\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress against ISIL and areas where we\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced some setback.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President is not designing our strategy around this military conflict based on monthly poll numbers, but he\xe2\x80\x99s doing it based on the national security interest of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to guide our strategy.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President continues to believe it\xe2\x80\x99s not in our best interest to essentially reinvade Iraq to try to solve this problem.\xc2\xa0 But rather, he\xe2\x80\x99s put in place a strategy that involves working with the international community to support the Iraqi security forces as they take the fight to ISIL in their own country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s a strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to pursue and a strategy that has shown some success.\xc2\xa0 But obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more work to be done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The message obviously from the American public is that it\xe2\x80\x99s going quite badly.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that has to be something that the administration realizes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the American public is understandably concerned about ISIL; the President is, too.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s laid out a clear strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with our national security interests to degrade and ultimately destroy them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- obviously protecting the national security interests of the United States is the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to lose sight of how important that is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s approval rating -- or a favorability rating being higher than the President\xe2\x80\x99s right now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reaction to that.</p>\n<p>Mr. Viqueira.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Earnest.\xc2\xa0 Congress today, a key subcommittee, the Appropriations Committee in the House, is moving to block funding for any prospective embassy in Havana.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if that move will hinder what appears to be an imminent announcement about normalizing relations.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was not aware of those specific plans but I\'m not particularly surprised by them.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that it is clearly in our interest to try to start normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And the next logical step in that normalization process would be establishing a Cuban embassy in the United States and establishing an American embassy in Cuba.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our diplomats are hard at work in trying to lay the groundwork for an announcement like that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not surprised to hear that there are some members of Congress that don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with that approach.\xc2\xa0 We have heard some from members of Congress who believe that if we would have just kept the 55-year embargo in place for a little while longer, maybe we would have started to see the kinds of changes that were promised at the beginning of imposition of that embargo.</p>\n<p>The President is a little skeptical of that case.\xc2\xa0 The President believed that after 55 years we needed to consider something more impactful, we needed a new strategy.\xc2\xa0 And the President continues to be convinced that by greater engagement between our governments, and greater engagement between our people, we can create economic opportunity for American businesses, but that we can also empower the Cuban people to advocate for and protect the basic human rights that are regularly trampled by the Cuban government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When we last left our story, the fourth round of negotiations with Cuban officials had not yielded a breakthrough on some of the -- sort of the underbrush and the nuts and bolts that has to be done.\xc2\xa0 What is the status of those negotiations, first of all?\xc2\xa0 Well, what is the status of those negotiations?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it was a couple of weeks ago that Cuban diplomats were in the United States meeting with U.S. officials over at State Department headquarters.\xc2\xa0 The readout that I got from those conversations were that the meetings were productive but that they were not essentially completed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t (inaudible) since then, is my question.\xc2\xa0 And how imminent is an announcement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the current status of those talks, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department for an update.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I have one final question on a different subject, and that is the Rohingya minority in Burma.\xc2\xa0 Burma just allowed -- 700 individuals, Rohingya, were floating offshore.\xc2\xa0 They just brought them back into the country.\xc2\xa0 I know the President had something to say about this on Monday.\xc2\xa0 They continue to be stateless individuals within their own country.\xc2\xa0 And the United States and the administration has maintained sanctions on Burma.\xc2\xa0 Will those sanctions be contingent on the fate of the Rohingya?\xc2\xa0 And what pressure will the U.S. apply to essentially give these people rights and give them citizenship within their own country?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mike, as it relates to the specific sanctions that are in place on Burma, I\'m going to have to take the question in terms of what impact those would have.\xc2\xa0 When it comes, though, to pressuring the government in Burma, the President did that when he traveled to Burma, and when he talked about the need for the Burmese government to respect the rights of all the citizens of Burma, and particularly to prevent violence being carried out against religious and ethnic minorities in that country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And he acknowledged that that was a basic responsibility of the central government, and expected them to do more and to do a better job of preventing the persecution of religious and ethnic minorities in that country.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s a pretty powerful statement for the President of the United States to travel there and deliver that message directly to the government and to the people of that country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But as it relates to the impact that might have on sanctions we have against the country, let me follow up with you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there concern that that persecution continues despite the President\xe2\x80\x99s opening towards Burma?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We certainly do continue to be concerned about the human rights situation as it relates to the Rohingya in Burma.\xc2\xa0 And that is a message that we have communicated consistently both in public and in private to the Burmese government.</p>\n<p>George.\xc2\xa0 Did you catch that game last night?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The Indians.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve got to reform the instant replay process.\xc2\xa0 The Royals got robbed on that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 They did.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a less important thing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Will a defeat on TPA undercut the President\xe2\x80\x99s standing at the G7 Summit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Are you asking -- say the first part again.\xc2\xa0 Would a defeat --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If he were to lose on TPA, would that undercut him at the summit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think a vote is planned in advance of the summit this weekend.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re not expecting to lose it.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will be traveling to the G7, some of whom are engaged in negotiations with the United States about a transatlantic trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to make the case to them that we believe that we\'re going to be able to build bipartisan support for the progressive trade promotion authority that passed the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And the President is considering these kinds of talks and trying to push for these kinds of agreements because it happens to be in the best interest of the U.S. economy and U.S. middle-class families.</p>\n<p>I know that there are European leaders that believe that that kind of agreement would be in the extraordinary interest of their economy and their middle class, as well.\xc2\xa0 So there may be an opportunity for us to try to see some common ground; that\'s on a little bit of a longer track.\xc2\xa0 But completing TPA legislation would enhance the likelihood of being able to successfully complete a European trade deal as well -- but much further down the line.</p>\n<p>Dave.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on a report today in The Washington Times that the Clinton Foundation had collected $26 million in donations in Sweden at the same time the Swedish government was lobbying the State Department under Hillary Clinton to forego sanctions against Swedish companies doing business with Iran?\xc2\xa0 Was the White House aware of this arrangement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen that report, Dave.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have to get back to you on it.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a couple things.\xc2\xa0 The Taliban has said this morning that it is their understanding and their belief that the Taliban Five currently in Doha are now free to go, and any attempt by the United States to limit their ability to travel would be a violation of international law, and the one-year agreement has been lived up to and all reports that that has been extended are false.\xc2\xa0 Any comment?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the agreement that the United States has is not with the Taliban, it\'s with Qatar.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s the government of Qatar that, at the request of the United States, has put some restrictive conditions on the individuals that were transferred from the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that there are conversations between the United States and Qatar ongoing about a longer-term resolution of the status of these individuals.\xc2\xa0 The United States is obviously very interested in making sure that steps are taken to mitigate the risk to the United States that is posed by these individuals.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In this interim period while the talks continue, are the travel restrictions as they were?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Essentially, while these talks are ongoing, the restrictive conditions that have been in place over the last year continue to remain in place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you describe what the goal of the administration is in the talks going forward --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the goal is to -- go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition to security.\xc2\xa0 Is the goal to maintain the restrictions as they are, maybe loosen them ever so slightly, essentially keep them in Doha?\xc2\xa0 What is the ultimate goal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\'t get into the substance of the conversations, primarily because of restrictions --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can describe the goal, though.\xc2\xa0 I understand the negotiations are -- there are a lot of variables there, a lot of factors, a lot of equities, stakeholders, et cetera, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the goal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to talk in detail about the goal is because ultimately those restrictive conditions that are in place are not something that we talk about in detail publicly.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why when it comes to the goal, it really is making sure that there are measures in place to protect the American people and the United States and our interests.\xc2\xa0 And what exact form those restrictions take is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss with the Qataris, but probably not be able to discuss publicly even after an agreement is reached.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, Tony Blinken said in an interview in France that airstrikes in the campaign that began last summer have killed more than 10,000 jihadists.\xc2\xa0 He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t specify numbers in Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 First of all, is that a number that the President is comfortable with?\xc2\xa0 It is a number far larger than we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen before, to my knowledge; I may have missed it.\xc2\xa0 Is that the number the President believes is true, is consistent with what the Pentagon and other coalition partners informed him?\xc2\xa0 And what does that say about what the state of the strategy is so far?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Major, what we are aware of is that there are thousands of ISIL fighters that have been taken off the battlefield due to the combined impact of our coalition military airstrikes as well as the efforts of Iraqi and Kurdish security forces on the ground.\xc2\xa0 And this is indicative of the kind of strategy that we see ISIL often use to essentially sacrifice significant numbers of foot soldiers, as they did around their failed attempt to take and hold Kobani, which, we assess, led to the death of at least a thousand ISIL fighters in that one Syrian town.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re also conscious of the fact that ISIL is aggressively recruiting foreign fighters from around the globe to try to replenish their ranks.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why our strategy is predicated on trying to counter the radical ideology and recruitment efforts of ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make it difficult for individuals that may aspire to join the fight to travel to that region of the world and successfully take up arms alongside ISIL, even as we continue to carry out missions on the battlefield that degrade and destroy the ISIL military organization.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But as it relates to the precise question about the number of ISIL fighters that have been killed, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense for the precise number.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no one from the Department of Defense has used that number.\xc2\xa0 The Deputy Secretary of State used that number.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m asking if the President is comfortable with this for a couple of reasons.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I would be curious how any of us -- anyone in this administration could know any real sense of casualties on the ground where the air campaign -- where there is virtually no U.S. eyeballs or presence, and you\xe2\x80\x99re fighting an enemy that is, by its very nature, mobile, secretive and hostile.\xc2\xa0 So this number seems very large.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it could be credible.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99re confident with the Deputy Secretary of State using it on behalf of the United States government to explain that this is actually working.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Major, the Department of Defense does conduct routinely battle damage assessments, particularly those related to military airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 And we know that Iraqi security forces also have the capability to carry out military missions and offer intelligence about what they\xe2\x80\x99re seeing on the ground.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The administration, at the direction of the President, has flooded Iraq with ISR equipment -- intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance equipment -- to monitor conditions on the ground.\xc2\xa0 So there are ways that we can derive estimates, but good estimates, of what\xe2\x80\x99s occurred in the aftermath of some of these military operations.\xc2\xa0 And I have no reason to believe that the number that was cited by Deputy Secretary Blinken was inaccurate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But for a more precise accounting of what that estimate is, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to be mindful of the fact that this is an organization that is working very hard to replenish their ranks, and they need to do so.\xc2\xa0 Because what we see is we see that ISIL, time and time again, has essentially directed their foot soldiers to be sacrificial lambs, in some instances, to go out there in essentially hopeless fights against either Iraqi security forces or Kurdish security forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not every fight is a hopeless fight, quite obviously.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 But we have seen instances where they\xe2\x80\x99ve done that.\xc2\xa0 There are more than a thousand -- again, based on these assessments that we\xe2\x80\x99ve conducted, there are more than a thousand ISIL fighters that lost their lives around Kobani only for ISIL to be driven out of Kobani.\xc2\xa0 That, I think, is a pretty good example of a situation where ISIL demonstrated a willingness to sacrifice the lives of a thousand foot soldiers in pursuit of a quixotic effort to take over one town in Syria, an effort that ultimately was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>But this is a much broader effort to degrade and destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to see is a more successful and more consistent effort and execution of the strategy by Iraqi security forces on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen important places of progress, and there are some areas where, with additional support, we hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll recover from recent setbacks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to ask you -- you said earlier the Supreme Court could turn the health care system into utter chaos.\xc2\xa0 Is that a warning to the Supreme Court on this matter?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Of course not.\xc2\xa0 It is, I think, the consequence that has been observed by a large number of individuals in both parties about the impact of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.\xc2\xa0 But this is a ruling that will be based on the merits of the legal arguments that were presented before the court.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of confidence in those arguments.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said repeatedly over the last couple of months, I guess, that you have a lot of confidence in the arguments.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked repeatedly about sort of a plan B, what happens if the decision doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go your way.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure that I understand you.\xc2\xa0 Is your message to the American people who now have this coverage, that, if the Supreme Court rules essentially against Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s position, they\xe2\x80\x99re out of luck and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a plan?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Our message to the American people is that they should be confident in the health care they have now because it is rooted in a sound legal basis that was presented in an argument before the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we believe that people should be confident.\xc2\xa0 And if that confidence is shaken, based on an adverse ruling from the Supreme Court, then that will have a substantial impact on the health insurance market in the United States -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything the White House or the President can do about it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, most people assume -- and I think they assume rightly; it\xe2\x80\x99s going to depend on exactly what the ruling is and what the scope is of the ruling -- most people assume that a remedy would require congressional action.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s ample evidence that making a bet in favor of prompt, wise and constructive congressional action when it comes to the health care is not a very good bet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on Major\xe2\x80\x99s questions, because there does seem to be among a lot of the people inside DOD and other military analysts, that for the progress that is made for the ISIL/ISIS fighters who are taken off the battlefield, that they are able, as you have suggested, to continue to recruit.\xc2\xa0 And many think that that is basically a net-zero proposition.\xc2\xa0 If what has happened as a result of U.S. policy and coalition efforts is essentially status quo in terms of the number of ISIS/ISIL fighters, then is that a failure of policy?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, because what we\'re doing is we\'re building up the capacity of Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 And we anticipated that we would start to see better performance on the battlefield once we had introduced more highly trained Iraqi security forces, once we saw more better-equipped Iraqi security forces on the battlefield, that their performance would improve.\xc2\xa0 And we would also see, over the course of time, improvement in our efforts to coordinate with the international community to both counter the radical ideology and recruitment messaging from ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We also have seen and will continue to improve upon our cooperative efforts to prevent individuals from actually traveling to that region of the world to take up arms alongside ISIL.</p>\n<p>But this is strategy, again, where we have seen some success, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen some setbacks.\xc2\xa0 But we would anticipate that we\'re going to continue to make progress against ISIL as we see more and better equipped, better trained security forces -- both in Iraq and in Syria -- taking the fight to ISIL on the ground.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if it\xe2\x80\x99s essentially the status quo in terms of the number of those taken off the battlefield and the number recruited, that\'s about where you would expect to be right now?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\'re saying?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I think -- no, that\'s what you\'re saying, I guess is the short answer to your question.\xc2\xa0 I think what I would say is that we have a strategy that is correctly oriented towards the situation that you\'re presenting, which is that we have seen that there are a substantial number of fighters fighting under the ISIL banner in Iraq and in Syria, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out a clear strategy for confronting them.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a strategy that is predicated on Iraqi and in Syria, Syrian fighters, taking the fight on the ground to ISIL in their own country.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll support them by training them, by equipping them, by offering them some advice in terms of how to carry out their military operations.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll back them with coalition military airpower.</p>\n<p>But the other thing that we can do is we can try to shut down ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing operations.\xc2\xa0 We can shut down ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s recruitment efforts.\xc2\xa0 And we can try to counter the radical messaging of ISIL to make it harder for them to bring in recruits.</p>\n<p>And so far we have seen ISIL demonstrate a willingness to sacrifice many of their foot soldiers on the battlefield in pursuit of some military operations that don\'t end up going their way.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately we acknowledge that there is much more important and even difficult work to be done to accomplish our ultimate goal of degrading and destroying ISIL.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A related question on ISIS.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s testimony today in Congress on those in this country who are feeding on ISIS propaganda through social media.\xc2\xa0 Are you confident that the administration has the tools it needs to keep track of and monitor those who are here in the United States radicalized by ISIS propaganda?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, you have heard from our law enforcement and national security professionals that this is very difficult work.\xc2\xa0 And the President himself has even observed on previous occasions that the threat that he\xe2\x80\x99s particularly worried about is sort of the lone wolf threat, an individual that could be radicalized but essentially would carry out an operation of their own doing that would result in some violence.\xc2\xa0 And trying to prevent that is exceedingly difficult.</p>\n<p>And in some ways that\'s all the more reason that we\'re gratified that the Senate finally did pass the USA FREEDOM Act to ensure that our national security professionals do have all the tools that they say are important to keeping the country safe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they\'re saying they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the tools, even with the renewal of the parts of the PATRIOT Act.\xc2\xa0 You have the head of the Counterterrorism Division of the FBI today say that one of the big problems they\'re facing is the availability of new encryption technology, and that they are \xe2\x80\x9cin the dark\xe2\x80\x9d -- those were his words.\xc2\xa0 They are in the dark.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s basically pleading for new authorities from Congress.</p>\n<p>That\'s why I\xe2\x80\x99m asking what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House position on this.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s saying thousands every day are feeding on ISIS propaganda in this country, and they don\'t have the authorities to keep track of them.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a challenge that the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not the PATRIOT Act.\xc2\xa0 They\'re looking for additional authorities.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is a challenge that the President has been mindful of.\xc2\xa0 He had the opportunity to talk about this a little bit when Prime Minister Cameron was visiting the White House early this year.</p>\n<p>And this does set up a tough challenge of balancing the privacy and civil liberties of law-abiding American citizens with the need for us to try to detect and apprehend terrorists before they commit an act of violence.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President has spoken to this, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\'re mindful of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, yes, you\'re right that the other challenge that\'s presented here is that when we\'re talking about technology, we\'re talking about new innovations.\xc2\xa0 And it means that the techniques that are employed by our national security professionals need to adapt to the innovations in the technology sector.\xc2\xa0 And that is a very difficult challenge, but it\xe2\x80\x99s one that the President\xe2\x80\x99s team is very focused on.</p>\n<p>And, frankly, there is an opportunity for us, in the mind of the President, to work with the tech sector on this; that as much as they value and champion the privacy and civil liberties rights of American citizens, we also know that those individuals do not want to be in a situation where their technology is responsible for allowing somebody who is seeking to carry out an act of violence to evade detection from the federal government.</p>\n<p>So this is a very thorny policy challenge, and maybe even among the most difficult challenges that the President faces.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s one that he\xe2\x80\x99s mindful of, it\xe2\x80\x99s one that his team has been working on, and one that we should be able to manage our way through if we try to seize the kind of common ground consistent with the way that the House of Representatives and the Senate acted to -- despite the difficult challenges of reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act, but also incorporating important reforms that require people to put aside politics, focus on those areas where we agree, and do something right for the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And even after an inexplicable delay by the Senate, that\'s ultimately what was achieved.\xc2\xa0 And that, I do think absent the delay, does serve as a model for how we can work our way through these other particularly difficult policy issues, as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a very quick follow-up to Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s questions about the polls.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s political team does do polling, right, and has access to polling -- private Democratic polling?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are -- and certainly through the DNC and other places, the President does have access to some polling information.\xc2\xa0 I would not say that he\xe2\x80\x99s a frequent consumer of that information, but he does have access to some of that data.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he must be aware of some of the same trends we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the CNN poll, the ABC poll?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any recent Democratic polls that measured the favorability of President Bush.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the approval of the handling of ISIS at just 31 percent is a pretty alarming number.\xc2\xa0 I would think that would be -- so he didn\xe2\x80\x99t even notice them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, not really.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, I think that it is common sense that the fact that the United States government and the President is confronting this threat is difficult work.\xc2\xa0 And I think the American people understand what a significant challenge this is, but I think everything else being equal, they\xe2\x80\x99d prefer that the President and the United States didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is, we do.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that the President is very focused on these national security threats, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have implemented the strategy that we have.\xc2\xa0 And this is not something that -- this is not work that\xe2\x80\x99s done in a way that reflects polling; it\xe2\x80\x99s work that\xe2\x80\x99s done in a way that reflects the core national security interests of the United States.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go on to another topic -- Katrina.\xc2\xa0 Ten years.\xc2\xa0 In a couple months we will mark 10 years since the levies broke in New Orleans.\xc2\xa0 And I understand that the Housing Secretary is going down there and working down there.\xc2\xa0 Is the President expected to go to New Orleans in August around the anniversary of Katrina?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that, April, at this point, but when we have some scheduling updates for the last week in August we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what, if anything, can you tell us that the administration has been working on?\xc2\xa0 Because when President Obama came into the administration, there were two cities that he was really looking at in a different way -- Detroit and New Orleans.\xc2\xa0 And then New Orleans started coming back on its own and so did Detroit to a certain extent, and they kind of fell into the same pot of other cities, other American cities.\xc2\xa0 What can you say just months out, been 10 years, how this administration is viewing New Orleans after Katrina?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple things about this.\xc2\xa0 The first is that one of the things that the President did when he took office was to appoint Craig Fugate to run FEMA.\xc2\xa0 And the confidence of the American people was shaken in our government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to respond to significant emergency disaster situations.\xc2\xa0 And because of the professionalism and experience of somebody like Craig Fugate, I think that confidence has been restored.\xc2\xa0 The President made that a priority.\xc2\xa0 And having had the opportunity to travel with the President when he has visited some communities across the country that have been wracked by a natural disaster, the citizens of those communities appreciate the commitments of their government to help them rebuild and recover and come back stronger than ever.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the effective work of somebody like Craig Fugate and all the men and women at FEMA that work for him.\xc2\xa0 It also is a testament, ultimately, to the state and local officials who are responsible for responding to these situations; that FEMA is typically there to support state and local officials who have the lead in the response to these efforts, and the President made that a priority when he came into office.\xc2\xa0 And for all the talk about the efforts to prevent a second Great Depression and for the President to pursue our national security interests around the globe, there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been as much talk about how effectively that particular agency has rehabilitated not just its image but their operations in a way that has profoundly affected the lives of thousands if not millions of Americans.</p>\n<p>As it relates to New Orleans more specifically, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a lot more to say about this in August as the anniversary gets closer.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that the President and his team have spent a lot of time working with officials in New Orleans to help that city recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression; that we have seen housing officials, officials from the Department of Labor and others talk about the work that the administration is doing in that community to help them continue to recover -- again, not just from the flood of Katrina from 10 years ago, but also from the economic downturn five years ago.\xc2\xa0 And one thing that we know from the data is that those individuals who were the most vulnerable in 2007 and 2008 were the individuals who were hit hardest by the great recession.\xc2\xa0 And that means individuals in New Orleans that were recovering from this terrible natural disaster were hit by the great recession probably at the worst possible time.</p>\n<p>But it\xe2\x80\x99s, first off, a testament to the grit and determination of the people of New Orleans to rebuild that city and to rebuild their economy and to rebuild so many of those communities that are rich in history and in character, to put it mildly.\xc2\xa0 But it also is an indication of the kind of resilience that we see in communities all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And there is a broader American story to tell about the renaissance that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in New Orleans.\xc2\xa0 And whether or not the President travels to that community or not in the last week in August, I expect you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear more from the President about this as the anniversary gets closer.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, candidates on both sides of the aisle are talking about the concern that they have that there is a national crisis with heroin, prescription drug deaths, addiction, et cetera, and talking about what they would do or what they\xe2\x80\x99d like to formulate as policy if they were President.\xc2\xa0 The President still has the job for 18 months.\xc2\xa0 Is the President persuaded, after listening to this commentary coming out of primary states, that there is more that this administration could do to tackle heroin, prescription drug deaths, or mental health issues?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is a growing challenge in many communities across the country.\xc2\xa0 And I know that the ONDCP, under the acclaimed leadership of Mr. Botticelli, has done a lot of important work in this area.\xc2\xa0 And I think what I should do is have somebody follow up with you with some more specifics about what the administration has done to address this growing problem, and what more we propose to do to try to head it off.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I feel confident in predicting that this is not a problem that will be solved in the next 18 months, but I do think the President would like to see additional progress be made in this really important fight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other question to follow up on ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that there are consequences for President Assad and his regime if, in effect, they\xe2\x80\x99re assisting ISIL in Syria right now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Alexis, we have seen some of those news reports suggesting that there may have in some locations in Syria -- not all of them, but in some locations in Syria -- that government forces may be acting in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s actually benefitting the ISIL forces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We also see reports that there are some other areas in Syria where Assad government forces are taking strikes against ISIL forces.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a very murky picture right now.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s indicative of the broader situation that we see inside Syria -- that, frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s because of the failed leadership of the Assad regime that they have -- that extremists have been able to make inroads in that country.</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it continues to be the policy of the United States that President Assad should step aside and allow for a political transition in that country so that they can have leadership in that country that reflects the views and ambitions of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to put an end to the violence inside that country.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously going to be a long road, even if Assad were to surprisingly announce today that he is leaving.\xc2\xa0 That would be a rather long road to rebuilding a country that\xe2\x80\x99s been wracked by so much violence.\xc2\xa0 But an announcement like that from President Assad would be obviously a very good start.</p>\n<p>Paul.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I was at a security event this morning, and a gentlemen who works with the FBI and other agencies said, look, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve always been one step behind tracking the bad guys.\xc2\xa0 I now feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re two, maybe three, steps behind the bad guys, just to play off Jon\xe2\x80\x99s comment about the FBI being more in the dark than ever before.\xc2\xa0 Tell me how national security is actually enhanced given the comments like these?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the comments and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see who said them.\xc2\xa0 But I will just say as a general matter, it sounds like somebody was weighing in in a discussion about some of the challenges that our law enforcement professionals face as they try to keep us safe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there is no doubt that there are significant challenges in that effort.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why there is a lot of frustration on the part of the administration, that there were simple steps that Congress could take but didn\xe2\x80\x99t that would have ensured that they have all the tools available to them as they try to keep us safe.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to see that, even belatedly, that the Senate did act and that many of those authorities have been restored in a reformed way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But this is a difficult challenge.\xc2\xa0 The President is mindful of this challenge.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget priorities reflect how significant a challenge this is.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s something that he devotes significant time to every single day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question again is, is national security enhanced or not?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a yes or no question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to evaluate that without seeing what the comments were and seeing who said them and in what context they were presented.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I just told you the comments.\xc2\xa0 The comments were, the FBI said, we\xe2\x80\x99re more in the dark than ever before.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to get hostile about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not hostile about it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We can just have a discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the FBI counterintelligence guy said we\xe2\x80\x99re more in the dark than ever before.\xc2\xa0 That does not suggest that we\xe2\x80\x99re safer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it reflects the challenges that are faced by greater encryption technology that\xe2\x80\x99s been developed that is allowing some extremists to try to evade detection by law enforcement authorities.\xc2\xa0 And this does pose a significant challenge.\xc2\xa0 And this is a challenge that the President discussed in the news conference that he convened with Prime Minister Cameron when he visited the White House earlier this year.</p>\n<p>And the President continues to be aware of this threat, and he also continues to be mindful of the fact that additional work needs to be done to confront it.\xc2\xa0 And he continues to be confident that even the tech companies that are sort of standing at the forefront of trying to protect the civil liberties of the American people and their customers would not want to be in a position in which their technology is being deployed to aid and abet somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s planning to carry out an act of violence.</p>\n<p>So there is an opportunity for us to try to resolve this very difficult challenge.</p>\n<p>Angela.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question on the trade vote.\xc2\xa0 You said you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a vote count to give us, but I want to take that back a step.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a vote count?\xc2\xa0 And I ask that because there have been some reports from the Hill from both sides of the aisle that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have vote counts from the other side.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s been very little information sharing, even backchannel.\xc2\xa0 So curious if you guys feel confident in the transparency you have right now on how that vote might go.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say that we do continue to be confident in the kind of working relationship that the administration maintains with Leader Pelosi on the Democratic side.\xc2\xa0 Obviously most of our efforts are targeted on trying to persuade Democratic House members to support this particular piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 And there have been a number of conversations between the President and individual Democrats in the House.\xc2\xa0 There have also been conversations between the President and Leader Pelosi on this issue.</p>\n<p>And, yes, we do continue to have a lot of confidence in the effectiveness of that relationship.\xc2\xa0 But I would also point out that the White House, and even the President, has been in touch with Republicans in the House on this issue.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner has indicated that he strongly supports this legislation.\xc2\xa0 We know that Chairman Ryan is also playing a leading role in building support among House Republicans in that effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And despite our many political differences, and despite the many challenges that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in working with leading House Republicans on other issues, I do think I can confidently say that we have been pleased with the effective communication between the White House and leading House Republicans on this issue too.</p>\n<p>And I think it is an example of the kind of progress that we can make when we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on those areas where we agree.\xc2\xa0 There are many more areas where we disagree.\xc2\xa0 And our ability to coordinate in this area doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change that, but it does highlight the potential that exists when we focus on working cooperatively in finding common ground.</p>\n<p>Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave -- again, have those comments leave you with the impression that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got this all sewed up; there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more work to be done on this.\xc2\xa0 But I continue to be, and I think I feel confident in telling you that we continue to be satisfied with the degree of cooperation and communication that we\xe2\x80\x99ve received with both Democratic and Republican House leaders on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One also from the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 There was a report out, I think this morning, that stated that Iran is still found to be developing ballistic technologies.\xc2\xa0 Obviously with the deadline approaching at the end of the month on the nuclear agreement details, that\xe2\x80\x99s a concern because those technologies could be used to carry a nuclear warhead, theoretically.\xc2\xa0 Is that report something that you think will pose a challenge for getting that deal done like the President wants to do?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the details of the report.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just observe a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One thing that we have indicated would need to be resolved in the context of these discussions are the outstanding questions about the possible military dimensions of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 We do continue to be concerned about that.\xc2\xa0 There are many unanswered questions.\xc2\xa0 And we would expect that those questions would be answered in the context of a final agreement if one can be reached by the end of June.</p>\n<p>That said, we have also been just as forthright about the fact that even if we are able to successfully complete negotiations at the end of June, it will not answer all of the questions that we have about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s questionable behavior in that region of the world.\xc2\xa0 And that includes some components of their military program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty blunt about that fact.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me disagree when some have described this as a rapprochement with Iran.\xc2\xa0 This would not be that.\xc2\xa0 But it would be a way for us to diplomatically prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Anita.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand the Serbian Prime Minister is here, and I thought it was at the request or the invitation of the Vice President, who I believe is not here.\xc2\xa0 Who is he meeting with?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that because the Vice President is not here today for obvious reasons, that the serving Prime Minister did have the opportunity to meet with Susan Rice, the National Security Advisor.\xc2\xa0 And we will have some more details about those conversations for you later today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any specific one topic?\xc2\xa0 Or is it -- this was a --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think they discussed a range of issues, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you some more detail about that meeting before the end of the day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And no meeting with the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President dropped by that meeting, no.</p>\n<p>Kevin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I want to take you back to trade for just a moment.\xc2\xa0 Earlier today, more than a dozen Democrats came on camera and expressed their displeasure with the idea of TPA.\xc2\xa0 And since it -- at least it seems to me to be a little bit of Democratic friendly fire, what does that say about the President\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the party that so many, and especially so many top Democrats, are so forcefully against TPA?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, I think it illustrates something that we all know, which is that many Democrats in Congress are opposed to trade legislation, and they are opposed reflexively because of the impact of previous trade agreements.\xc2\xa0 The case that the President has made with some success is that this kind of trade agreement is one that includes for the first time enforceable labor standards, enforceable environmental standards, and human rights standards that are written into the agreement that will level the playing field and have a positive impact on the American economy and on the economic opportunity that\'s available to middle-class families across the country.</p>\n<p>That is a persuasive argument.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t expect, however, that it will persuade every single Democrat to support it.\xc2\xa0 But we did see that when the President was given the opportunity to make this argument to members of the Senate, that we got about a third of Senate Democrats to vote for this bill.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to make a similar case in the House.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that we\'re going to get up to that one-third level, but it is an indication that when we make the argument that there is ample reason for progressives in Congress to support the bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One big name that has yet to come out in support of it is Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- former Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 Would it matter either way, yay or nay, if she came out in support of TPA or TPP to the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a vote in Congress, and it\'s those votes in Congress that we\'re counting right now.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s why the focus of our efforts is on members of the United States House of Representatives, principally Democrats, but there are conversations that we\'re having with Republicans as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it matter at all?\xc2\xa0 Would he care?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, ultimately, she\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make her own decision in terms of what she wants to say about this publicly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, let me ask you about WikiLeaks wanting to crowdsource about a $100,000 to have people release details of TPP.\xc2\xa0 Are you aware of that report?\xc2\xa0 And what reaction does the White House have?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Our reaction is just simply that there is no TPP agreement right now; we\'re working to finalize one.\xc2\xa0 And when we have one, it will be made public, and the American public will have the opportunity to review the agreement and to speak their mind about it for two months prior to the President\xe2\x80\x99s signature.\xc2\xa0 And even after the President signs it, there will be a robust public debate in the United States Congress about the wisdom of this approach and the wisdom of entering into this agreement.\xc2\xa0 The President continues to be confident that if we\'re able to reach an agreement it will be consistent with the trade promotion authority legislation that has already passed the Senate and hopefully will soon pass the House.</p>\n<p>But there will be ample opportunity for the American public to look at the details of these agreements and to make up their own mind, frankly, about what impact they would have on the American economy.</p>\n<p>Byron.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen reports that the White House is reviewing its ISIS strategy.\xc2\xa0 Any updates on when we might hear from the President about any changes or updates to it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 And I would remind you that the way that we have described this policymaking process is simply that the President challenges his national security team to continually be refining that strategy, to looking at areas where we\'ve made progress, to extract some lessons learned that can be applied to those areas where we\'re experiencing some setback.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s part of an ongoing, robust policymaking process.</p>\n<p>And so I wouldn\'t expect any major presidential announcements on this in the near future, but I think you can expect that the President will continue to engage in regular discussions with his national security team about how we can continue to refine the strategy and continue to build on the momentum where we\'re seeing progress and shore up our efforts where we\'re seeing some setback.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Iran negotiations, does the White House have a plan in place for dealing with all the various parties that have concerns about a final agreement?\xc2\xa0 There are concerns from the Gulf State allies, Israel, many in Congress.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House plan for approaching this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Byron, I think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of that plan already; that just in the last few weeks, the President and his team have engaged with Democrats and Republicans in the Congress about the merits of the political agreement that was already reached back in the first week in April.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President convene a summit with Gulf leaders at Camp David just last month, where they had a discussion of a wide range of security issues in that region of the world, including the efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 I would expect that those kinds of conversations with Gulf leaders will continue even if not in person.</p>\n<p>And the President I think has been pretty forthright about his efforts to communicate with those who are most concerned about Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security about how he believes the security interests of Israel can be best served by using diplomacy to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And this is a case that we have been engaged in making for quite some time, and I would anticipate that we\'ll have the opportunity to do it again if we\'re able to reach an agreement in the last month of June.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more quick question.\xc2\xa0 I know you talked broadly about FOIA yesterday, but in a hearing on the Hill, Rep Chaffetz said it was a White House memo that requires White House counsel review of all FOIA related to the White House that\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for it being federal backlog in FOIA.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree with that?\xc2\xa0 And why is the counsel reviewing FOIA?\xc2\xa0 This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a policy that was in place in previous administrations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting that you say that.\xc2\xa0 I actually do have a quote from a memo that was put forward by Stephen Markman, September 1st, 1988.\xc2\xa0 We had to dig way deep into the archives to come up with that one.\xc2\xa0 It said, \xe2\x80\x9cRecords originating with or involving the White House Office should be forwarded to the Office of the Counsel to the President for any recommendations or comments it may wish to make prior to your final response to the requester.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Stephen Markman was a senior Justice official in the Reagan administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>January of 1992, a gentleman named Steven Schlesinger, who was a senior Department of Justice official in the Bush administration, said that, \xe2\x80\x9cRecords originating with or involving the White House Office should be forwarded to the Office of the Counsel to the President for any recommendations or comments it may wish to make prior to your final response to the requester.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>This is an indication that this policy has been in place at least as it relates to two recent presidential Republican -- two recent Republican presidents.\xc2\xa0 And so I would make the case to you that the memo that has been frequently cited on Capitol Hill in the last couple of days is entirely consistent with the policy that was in place under President Reagan and under the first President Bush.</p>\n<p>And at the same time, the suggestion that this memo has -- or this policy has created an undue backlog I don\xe2\x80\x99t think is reflected in the facts.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the administration has processed just last year 647,000 FOIA requests.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that 91 percent of those requests did result in the release of some or all of the requested information, that is an indication of this administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to responding in full, as often as possible, to FOIA requests.</p>\n<p>I also recognize that there is a tendency on the part of those who submit FOIA requests to focus on the 9 percent that didn\xe2\x80\x99t get satisfactory responses, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the job of those individuals.\xc2\xa0 But their criticisms do not reflect the evidence -- the accumulated evidence about our commitment to the FOIA process.</p>\n<p>David Jackson, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to free trade, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the economic aspects of this; there\xe2\x80\x99s a political.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the unions and some other groups are threatening Democratic members, or threatening to oppose them or withhold their money if they vote for a fast track authority.\xc2\xa0 Is the President talking to members about that and promising some political help on this vote?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has made very clear, both in public and in private, a willingness to stand with Democrats who stand with him on the trade argument.\xc2\xa0 And considering the President\xe2\x80\x99s status among Democratic voters across the country -- I read one recent poll that indicated the President was the most popular and influential and well-liked figure in Democratic politics right now.</p>\n<p>So having somebody with the President\xe2\x80\x99s heft on your side I think is a significant political benefit.\xc2\xa0 And that is a promise that the President has made to Democrats who are willing to support the most progressive trade legislation that the Senate has ever passed.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that should give all Democrats the confidence to vote their conscience when it comes to this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How big a threat is this -- are all these political threats that are going around?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that keeps me up at night, but of course my name is not on the ballot.\xc2\xa0 And I think those who are concerned about it I think do take a lot of solace in knowing that they can count on the support of President Barack Obama in a Democratic primary if they need it.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:57 P.M.
