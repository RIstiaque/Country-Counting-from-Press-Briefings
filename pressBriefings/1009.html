EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for coming with us on this trip to Fort Bragg where, as you know, the President will be meeting with troops and addressing the troops.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s joined by the First Lady.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a trip in which the President will thank our servicemen and women for their remarkable sacrifice, their remarkable contributions, their incredible professionalism -- all of which has led to this day where we are now in the final weeks of bringing all American forces home from Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The Iraq war, an eight-and-a-half-year war, is over.\xc2\xa0 The President promised when he was running for this office that he would end the war responsibly, and he is keeping that commitment.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the focus today is really on the extraordinary sacrifice that our men and women in uniform have made and their remarkable professionalism and success.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn another note, before I take your questions, I just happened to be reading before I came back here to speak with you an account of an encounter that the Speaker of the House had with reporters this morning, and I had to laugh because he was asked, the Speaker was, about whether or not he could name any small businesses that were affected by a surtax on millionaires and billionaires, the likes of which the Senate Democrats have put forward as a pay-for for the payroll tax cut extension and expansion.\xc2\xa0 He said a lot but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t name any, and the fact of the matter is, it\xe2\x80\x99s more evidence that the number-one talking point of Republicans in refusing to ask millionaires and billionaires to pay just a little bit more so that 160 million working Americans can get a tax break is bogus, even by their definition of small businesses, which allows for investment advisors and law partners and others who file their small business -- their business income under personal income at more than a million dollars -- it\xe2\x80\x99s still fewer than 1 percent of all small businesses.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I just urge everyone who reports on this, when they dutifully repeat the pushback from Republicans about why doing what the American public overwhelmingly supports is not a good thing to do, that their number-one reason for that is false.\xc2\xa0 Just not backed up by the facts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the White House and Republicans are still very far apart on this.\xc2\xa0 How do you see this all playing out?\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s going -- the debate over this is going to drag on into next week, and is the President going to keep insisting that people stay here for the holidays?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that will be necessary for people to do that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, if I had a crystal ball, I would have predicted that Denver would go on this remarkable run after Tim Tebow started as quarterback for the Broncos, and I would have made a lot of money in Vegas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have a crystal ball, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the endgame will look like, how this will all end.\xc2\xa0 What is the case is that there is still time for Congress to do all of its work; both finish its business and the American people\xe2\x80\x99s business in time for their scheduled vacation by the end of this week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt really isn\xe2\x80\x99t that complicated.\xc2\xa0 Democrats, Republicans, the President all support -- at least Republicans say they support -- at the very least extending the existing payroll tax cut to 160 million Americans into next -- for 2012.\xc2\xa0 They should pass a bill that does that -- that pays for it in a fair way, does not have within it entirely extraneous issues like pipelines and other things, and then get on with the business of wrapping up this omnibus spending bill.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s easily doable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us, at Fort Bragg -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not there for that long today -- before he goes out on stage who he\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking to, meeting with, and what else is not on the public schedule that you can share with us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know he has some meetings.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get that to you.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he and the First Lady are meeting with troops, maybe some Gold Star families.\xc2\xa0 But let me just double-check that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain why you are supportive of a short-term CR in this case, while in the past you\xe2\x80\x99ve been very critical of that approach and described it as \xe2\x80\x9cgoverning by tollbooth,\xe2\x80\x9d or words to that effect?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s not ideal to engage in that practice.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re long -- in the calendar year of 2011, we\xe2\x80\x99re long past achieving an ideal in terms of congressional functionality.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I am saying is that there is no reason for anyone to talk about shutting down the government when this Congress has seven times previously this year shown its willingness to pass a short-term CR in order to allow for a little more time to get its work done.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t even need to get to that point, but if we were, later in the week, to be in that situation, then they should just pass a short-term CR to ensure that there\xe2\x80\x99s no disruption in the functioning of government, and then finish their business.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s just that it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty straightforward and easy thing to do, as they\xe2\x80\x99ve demonstrated in the past.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken that position.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not suggesting that it\xe2\x80\x99s the ideal way for Congress to do its work.\xc2\xa0 But I think anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s witnessed the dysfunctionality in Congress brought on by Republican obstructionism this year would suggest that this Congress is capable of achieving an ideal.\xc2\xa0 In fact, in the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll I think -- wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it more than 40 percent of Americans deemed this Congress to be the worst in history over these many, many years?\xc2\xa0 Many, many Congresses -- the worst -- the very worst in history.</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, I guess if they want to cement that role they could leave town without doing anything on the payroll tax and thereby ensuring that 160 million working and middle-class Americans have their taxes go up on January 1st.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Iraq war piece, two questions.\xc2\xa0 The first is, are you -- there was some suggestion yesterday that the message today would also be about returning veterans and economic issues.\xc2\xa0 Are you going to be trying to essentially put an economic message into what is sort of at core a national security speech?\xc2\xa0 But is the economic message part of this as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is part of it.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the very important work that the First Lady has done and Dr. Biden has done.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s very much a part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda to ensure that those veterans who have fought so bravely for us in foreign wars do not return home and have to fight for a job.\xc2\xa0 And that was why the President pushed so hard for the veterans employment component of the American Jobs Act, and why we were pleased that, thus far, that is the only element of the American Jobs Act that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to get some cooperation out of Republicans on.\xc2\xa0 But there is still a lot of work to be done, and there are a variety of components to this push, including the -- working with private industry to pledge themselves to hire more returning veterans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given how dominant the economy is as an issue for most Americans, is that a way to make what\xe2\x80\x99s happening this week a little more irrelevant to their --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not, because this is a theme that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pushing quite aggressively for a long time, because it\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly important to both the President and the First Lady, as well as the Vice President and Dr. Biden.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to a community like the one surrounding Fort Bragg, because you have a lot of servicemen and women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, and who are trying to enter the workforce and facing the kinds of challenges that still exist out there in this challenging economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo our commitment to the men and women who put on our uniform should not end when they take it off.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is going to talk about all the sacrifices that this nation has given for this war in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Was it worth it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he was asked this question in the press conference he gave with Prime Minister Maliki and --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly asked that question; he was asked if it was still \xe2\x80\x9ca dumb war.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He was --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So I think the answer is the same, which is that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer that question.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- history will judge whether the war was worth it.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position has not changed, which is that he did not support getting into this war, did not support the way that the previous administration led us to war in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And he made that clear during the campaign and that\xe2\x80\x99s not a position that\xe2\x80\x99s changed.\xc2\xa0 But he committed, as a candidate, and has reiterated that commitment as President, to ending this war responsibly; to making sure that the steps he took as Commander-in-Chief were the right ones to ensure that America\xe2\x80\x99s national security interests were protected, and that the incredible sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, of their families and of the broader American public in Iraq were validated.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does that mean -- if he still believes it was a mistake, does that mean that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think history judges that.\xc2\xa0 His view --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question to ask you guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not a fair question, but I\xe2\x80\x99m answering it as best I can, which is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on how we got into the war hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to make that decision when he took the oath of office in January of 2009.\xc2\xa0 We already had more than 150,000 troops in Afghanistan [sic], and we were -- so it was two and a half years ago, entering the -- coming up on our eighth year of war -- or rather our sixth year of war there.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo his responsibility was to make sure that his policies created the best possible environment for Iraq going forward, which would thereby make the extraordinary sacrifices of the men and women in uniform, as well as the broader American public, validated, if you will; that it is his responsibility to put -- to pursue a policy that allowed us to withdraw our forces by the end of this year, which is happening, and to give Iraq the best chance possible to have a prosperous and democratic future.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it worth it for you to have a democracy there?\xc2\xa0 And do you think now -- I mean, looking back is it worth it to have a democracy like that in the Middle East right now?\xc2\xa0 And do you think that democracy will be able to be sustained with Iran influences that are infiltrating the country now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with your end question.\xc2\xa0 The President addressed this, too, as did Prime Minister Maliki, that the significantly overstated issue of Iranian influence -- I mean, the actions that the Prime Minister has taken, the government of Iraq have taken, that demonstrate the opposite and demonstrate I think a feeling felt broadly by the Iraqi people, which is a profound sense of national identity and a resistance to outside influence.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it was said at the time when the Vice President was making so many trips to Iraq and I was joining him that the elections in Iraq demonstrated that while the Iranians spent a great deal of money to try to influence the outcome there, they failed miserably.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to foretell the future.\xc2\xa0 But as I said yesterday, what is a very positive sign is the fact that the major parties and players in Iraq have now for a number of years chosen to resolve their differences through the political process, through the democratic political process and not through violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd while there will be challenges, security challenges in the future as Iraq progresses, they are moving in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many more visits one-on-one with troops before year\xe2\x80\x99s end, before the war is officially over?\xc2\xa0 Is this the last one?<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other scheduling announcements to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is tonight\xe2\x80\x99s fundraiser closed press?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because, as you know, when the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give an address, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the pool in.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you as a veteran of many driveways in serving pool duty when we weren\xe2\x80\x99t let in at all under previous Presidents that this White House endeavors to bring -- to give the press the greatest possible access and certainly greater than any predecessor -- or at least as great as any of his predecessors, so the vast majority of events that this President does -- campaign events -- include a print pooler.\xc2\xa0 But when he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t speak, we don\xe2\x80\x99t include it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll set?\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:18 A.M.
