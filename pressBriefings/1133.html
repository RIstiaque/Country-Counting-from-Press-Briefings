EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 How are we doing this morning, everybody?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re fine, good.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you could join us for the ride to Toledo this morning.\xc2\xa0 I do have a -- I do want to start with some details about why we\xe2\x80\x99re traveling to Toledo today, so if you\xe2\x80\x99ll bear with me for this opening, just to give you a sense of what we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to accomplish on this trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is traveling to Toledo today because it demonstrates the impact of an important economic decision and economic policy that the President put in place more than two years ago.\xc2\xa0 Two years ago, Chrysler was in a situation -- the larger auto industry was in a situation where they were -- basically they had run out of money, and there were many people in Washington, D.C., and other economic circles who were ready to give them up for dead.\xc2\xa0 And the President faced a fundamental decision about whether to intervene and rescue them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at just two years later, thanks to that tough decision, thanks to the difficult sacrifices made by the stakeholders, by the employees and the management of the company, we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen a remarkable turnaround that\xe2\x80\x99s occurred much more quickly than anybody had previously expected.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is that Chrysler has now repaid -- six years ahead of schedule -- the money that was lent to them by this administration.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that the federal government has now exited our financial stake in Chrysler with the deal that was finalized overnight.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a dramatic turnaround.\xc2\xa0 And Chrysler the company itself is now in a position where they are gaining market share, they\xe2\x80\x99re hiring back workers, they\xe2\x80\x99re opening up plants, they\xe2\x80\x99re profitable, they\xe2\x80\x99re investing in old plants.\xc2\xa0 So there is -- this is a very dramatic turnaround.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the reason that I cite this and the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99re going there today is this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t just had a big impact on the families of people who are employed by Chrysler, but it\xe2\x80\x99s actually also had a pretty significant impact on the employees of the auto suppliers.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of jobs that are tied directly to the success, or at least the continued operation, of Chrysler.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s actually had an impact on the broader economy, when there are communities like Toledo that are fundamentally tied to the economic success of the -- of these auto companies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo when the President is on this trip to Toledo, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to go visit the plant, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk to workers there, but he\xe2\x80\x99s also going to spend some time talking to people in the community, talking to small business owners, talking to workers at some of these other facilities that rely on the economic activity that\xe2\x80\x99s generated by the success of this local Chrysler plant.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd this is a broader story that we\xe2\x80\x99re telling about the American economy; that if you looked two years ago where our broader economy was, we were losing 600,000 and 700,000 jobs a month, a little over two years ago.\xc2\xa0 And we were in dire economic straights.\xc2\xa0 And the President had to make some very difficult decisions, and we\xe2\x80\x99re back on the right track, that even the jobs numbers today indicate that we\xe2\x80\x99ve created about 80,000 private sector jobs just last month.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this has been -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty dramatic reversal from where we were two years ago, and it gives us a lot of confidence about the trajectory, the current trajectory, of the U.S. economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99ll open today.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s take some questions, and at the end remind me and we\xe2\x80\x99ll do a little week ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, in light of these numbers today, they\xe2\x80\x99re still softer than they were before, is touting the auto industry a bit backward looking?\xc2\xa0 I mean, does the President want to suggest that the answer to joblessness is more government spending, as it did for the auto industry -- $80 billion in taxpayer money?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President believes is that -- the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99re coming to Toledo -- again, the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99re coming to Toledo is that if you look at where we\xe2\x80\x99ve come from, the turnaround is pretty dramatic; that if you look at where we were two years ago, that we were loosing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a long ways to go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Every -- the first Friday of every month at the White House we get a report about the jobs that were created the month before.\xc2\xa0 And every time we look at those numbers, we don\'t -- we don\'t get too excited by what those numbers say, and we don\'t get too disappointed by what those numbers say.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at is the overall trends.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if you look at the overall trends, over just the last 15 months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve created over 2 million private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 In just the last six months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve created about a million private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 And if you look even over the last four months, we\xe2\x80\x99re on -- we\xe2\x80\x99re averaging about 200,000 jobs a month of private sector job creation.\xc2\xa0 So our trajectory is moving in the right direction, and we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that there have been some head winds lately, and that there have been some bumps on the road of this recovery.\xc2\xa0 But if you look at where we\xe2\x80\x99ve come from, we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that if we keep moving down the same direction, that that\'s where -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get to a full economic recovery.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the auto industry bailout provide a model for how to deal with it looking ahead?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has actually been pretty clear about what he believes we need to do to strengthen our economy.\xc2\xa0 Again, if you look at over the last six months, the President has put in place -- has worked with Republicans to put in place some policies that are benefiting Americans right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a payroll tax that was a part of that bipartisan agreement on taxes at the end of last year, so that American workers today are -- every time they get their paycheck, every Friday they get their paycheck, they\'re getting a tax benefit.\xc2\xa0 The President believes -- last year the President signed legislation that provided 17 tax cuts to small businesses as a part of getting our economy moving again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are some other things the President believes we should do.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some additional tax cuts that we can provide to business.\xc2\xa0 We can make permanent the R&amp;D tax credit.\xc2\xa0 We can provide tax credits and incentives for electric vehicles.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has pursued a very aggressive trade agenda.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s laid out a plan to double our exports over the next four years.\xc2\xa0 Just in the last six months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve signed trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia that would create or support 70,000 American jobs here at home.\xc2\xa0 Last week, the administration revealed the results of our regulatory look-back, so that we could eliminate regulations that are overly burdensome on businesses.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are a number of things that we can do moving forward.\xc2\xa0 The President has even talked about a bipartisan infrastructure plan that would upgrade our roads, railways, and runways that could have a significant economic impact.\xc2\xa0 So there are a number of things that we could do moving forward.\xc2\xa0 There have some bumps along the road to this recovery, but if you look at the overall trajectory of our economy there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of cause for optimism.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction to the Moody\xe2\x80\x99s downgrade threat?\xc2\xa0 And then also, did this not come up at the meeting yesterday?\xc2\xa0 Pelosi seemed to suggest that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t some talk about Moody\xe2\x80\x99s at the White House meeting yesterday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it came up in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 As I recall, I think this -- the Moody\xe2\x80\x99s report came out after the markets closed, didn\xe2\x80\x99t it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was during the -- no, it was during the day.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about whether it came up in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 But what I can say is that what the Moody\xe2\x80\x99s report underscores is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying for quite some time, which is that it\xe2\x80\x99s critically important for the United States of America to fulfill our financial obligations, and Congress needs to act to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, it also demonstrates that we need to act in bipartisan fashion to engage in some significant long-term deficit reform.\xc2\xa0 The President has laid out a plan where we cut trillions from our deficit over the next 10 to 12 years.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President is currently leading bipartisan, bicameral talks to try to confront this issue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pleased with the progress that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been making in those talks.\xc2\xa0 And, again, this Moody\xe2\x80\x99s report underscores the importance of making progress on both of those things, both in terms of Congress acting to fulfill our financial obligation, but also in terms of reaching a long-term agreement -- or an agreement about our long-term deficit challenges.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back to the economy, quickly.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about numbers 15 months ago, four months ago.\xc2\xa0 In the last month, the economic indicators have clearly cooled and there\xe2\x80\x99s mounting concern that the U.S. economy is beginning to lag, losing altitude.\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- is the President concerned that there\xe2\x80\x99s risk of a double-dip recession?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 If you look -- again, if you look at the trajectory, the overall trajectory of our economy, we -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of cause of optimism.\xc2\xa0 Again, just in the last 15 months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve created more than 2.1 million private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 And just in the last six months, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at about a million private sector jobs created.\xc2\xa0 And the average over the last four months is 200,000 private sector jobs created.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are a lot of these economic indicators that are out there.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at is not just the one-month numbers, regardless of what those numbers.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not looking at the one-month numbers -- we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the trends.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at it over the last seven quarters, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had seven consecutive quarters of economic growth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is a long-term recovery to dig out of this very deep hole.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re moving in the right direction, and we feel confident about the direction that we\xe2\x80\x99re moving right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But clearly the economy has lost a little bit of momentum.\xc2\xa0 In this environment, how aggressively can you cut government spending without risking what gains you\xe2\x80\x99ve made?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has talked about this at length.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the federal government needs to tighten our belts.\xc2\xa0 And I should point out that the President believes that if the federal government does its part to tighten our belt, to reduce our deficit over the long term, that actually has significant benefits for the economy.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s -- as if -- we talked about this in the context of the Moody\xe2\x80\x99s report yesterday, but in terms of the overall health of the economy there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant benefit to getting something done on long-term deficit relief.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the President also believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s critically important that in the context of that deficit reform, that we don\xe2\x80\x99t undermine our ability to win the future; that we don\xe2\x80\x99t undermine the continued economic recovery by cutting investments in research and development; that we can\xe2\x80\x99t cut investments in education.\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of things that actually hold the key to our long-term economic success.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be cutting spending -- funding for that -- in these investments at this time.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the President believes that long-term deficit reduction is something that is good for the economy, in addition to being good for our deficit picture.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The situation in Syria seems to be worsening with the military cracking down and even reportedly a boy being tortured and killed.\xc2\xa0 Is the President at all going to chance his stance and have a hardened position on Assad?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You know, the President has spoken about this at length and the President obviously -- and other senior administration officials have condemned violence in Syria.\xc2\xa0 It is also our belief that reforms need to be implemented to end that violence and bring some stability to that situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that include Assad stepping down?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the President has said is that these reforms need to be implemented.\xc2\xa0 And if that means that President Assad needs to get out of the way so those implement -- so that those reforms can be implemented, then that\xe2\x80\x99s what needs to happen.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has said about this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, clearly -- in the House of Representatives there\xe2\x80\x99s a vote today.\xc2\xa0 Clearly in both sides of the aisle now there\xe2\x80\x99s growing concern about mission creep in Libya, the lack of official notification in accordance with existing American law.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s thought about this vote today and is he concerned about a lack of support of Congress?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you remember, Mike, congressional -- the administration believes strongly in the concept of consulting with leaders in Congress.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President himself consulted with congressional leaders before military action in Libya even began.\xc2\xa0 And as this operation has continued, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve shifted control of this operation to our NATO partners -- or the lead of this NATO operation to our partners, we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to consult with Congress all along.\xc2\xa0 In fact, in just the last week, there have been three separate congressional briefings that have been convened by this administration\xe2\x80\x99s national security team for leaders in Congress to keep them apprised of the progress and the situation there.\xc2\xa0 So clearly --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not in accordance with the War Powers Act, in terms of official notifications and the 60-day expiration, which happened two weeks ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is the view of this administration that we\xe2\x80\x99ve acted in accordance with the War Powers Act because of this regular consultation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaged in that consultation all along -- as I mentioned, three separate briefings have been held just this week for members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re committed to that moving forward.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the resolutions that you asked about in your first question, the President -- that continued consultation demonstrates why these resolutions are unnecessary and unhelpful.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Europe, the President said that the U.N. mission of civilian protection cannot be accomplished as long as Qaddafi remains in power.\xc2\xa0 So will the mission continue until Qaddafi is removed from power?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The mission will continue to enforce United States resolution -- Security Council resolution 1973.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which the President now interprets as having the end goal -- he conflates the mission with removal of Qaddafi.\xc2\xa0 So will the mission continue until Qaddafi is removed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Who did you say conflated that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President.\xc2\xa0 In Europe, he said the civilian protection mission cannot be completed until Qaddafi is removed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I necessarily agree with the context of your question, but what I will say is this.\xc2\xa0 We are committed to -- we are committed to fulfilling the guidelines of that resolution, which is protection of civilians, which is an arms embargo that\xe2\x80\x99s very important to protect those civilians.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re working obviously with our NATO partners to conduct.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Google, the Wall Street Journal has a report this morning that some members of the White House staff\xe2\x80\x99s Gmail accounts were interfered with.\xc2\xa0 Any information on that?\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything additional on that.\xc2\xa0 The FBI is leading this investigation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are a number of government agencies that are involved in taking a look at this.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new to say on that front.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any contact between the government and China since yesterday on Google?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, do you have any reaction to Mitt Romney today, after the jobless numbers came out, saying that this shows that we\xe2\x80\x99re going backwards and that the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies have made the recession worse?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that even elementary math indicates that our economic picture is significantly better than it was when this President took office.\xc2\xa0 So, again, when this President took office we were losing 600,000 to 700,000 jobs a month.\xc2\xa0 And even the jobs numbers that were reported today indicate that we created last month about 80,000 private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 So that is cause for optimism.\xc2\xa0 That is an indication that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made significant progress digging out of this deep hole.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, the President remains dissatisfied with the current situation, the status of the economy.\xc2\xa0 He believes that it is important that we continue to grow this economy, to create jobs, so that every single American who wakes up wanting a job, looking for a job, can find a job.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you mentioned earlier about the anemic jobs numbers.\xc2\xa0 The things the President has proposed, like the R&amp;D tax credit, is he considering any new measures to stimulate the economy further?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned, I think that there are a number things that Congress has not yet acted on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any new proposals, anything he has not yet talked about?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, let\xe2\x80\x99s have Congress act on the things that we believe that we need to do.\xc2\xa0 This is ratifying these trade agreements with trade adjustment assistance; this is the consideration of a bipartisan infrastructure plan; this is making perm the R&amp;D tax credit; this is a tax credit for electric vehicles, which seems particularly pertinent given the activities of the President today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are a number of things that Congress can do.\xc2\xa0 There are also a number of things that -- patent reform should be added to that list.\xc2\xa0 But there are also some things that the President has asked his administration to do in terms of the regulatory look-back that I mentioned earlier to ensure that businesses aren\xe2\x80\x99t hindered by overly burdensome or outdated regulations.\xc2\xa0 So there are a number of things that we could do moving forward.\xc2\xa0 Congress should act and the President\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to be working on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any consideration of making the payroll tax credit, tax cut, extending that past December 31st?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements on that today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just quickly on Yemen, the reports of the presidential palace was shelled.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any update on that the health of President Saleh, whether he was hurt?\xc2\xa0 And anything further to what Jay said in the briefing yesterday about the message that John Brennan is taking to the region?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those conflicting reports about what happened there.\xc2\xa0 The President was briefed on this issue this morning.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything -- well, let me just say this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything beyond what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, which is that obviously condemn the violence on both sides, that we hope that there will be and that there should be a negotiated settlement in Yemen, and that we believe that President Saleh should sign the agreement transferring power.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the administration about this second bailout for Greece -- the ripple effects for the rest of the U.S. economy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring in our -- the Europeans have said that they have the wherewithal and the interest to -- and the resources to deal with this situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed on it, or what\xe2\x80\x99s he -- has he gotten any calls regarding the second bailout?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of anything about any calls that he\xe2\x80\x99s made on this issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back to the jobless numbers, one of the cohorts that\'s particularly hurt is young people -- 16.5 percent unemployment among them.\xc2\xa0 They\'re coming off -- out of college into the jobs market, not finding jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\'s one out of six not finding jobs.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a particular message for them?\xc2\xa0 This is an important group for the President politically.\xc2\xa0 What can he offer young people?\xc2\xa0 Any hope for them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- what the President does is he takes a holistic approach to this, which is that the top item on his domestic agenda every morning when he wakes up is what we can do to ensure that Americans of any age, frankly, have -- if they\'re looking for a job, and they want a job, and they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a job, that they can get a job.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are -- that these are the kinds of things -- I went through the list before of the kinds of things that the President believes that Congress should do to try and enhance the ability of those Americans who are looking for a job to find one.\xc2\xa0 And the President is not going to rest until we\xe2\x80\x99ve dug our way out of this deep hole and until those Americans who are looking for a job can find one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything else?\xc2\xa0 All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s do a week ahead here real quick.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll send out a longer, sort of more robust version.\xc2\xa0 They gave me a lot of language here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The short version is, on Monday, the President will meet with his national security team on Afghanistan and Pakistan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, the President and First Lady will host Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for an official visit at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The official visit will celebrate the strong and enduring U.S.-German alliance.\xc2\xa0 It will provide an opportunity for the President and Chancellor to consult on a full agenda of foreign policy, security and economic issues, including ongoing NATO operations in Libya and Afghanistan, democratic transitions in Egypt and Tunisia, Middle East peace, Iran nuclear compliance and the global economic recovery -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a full agenda, it sounds like.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday, the President will hold an event in the Washington, D.C., area highlighting the importance of training and preparing our workforce to compete for manufacturing jobs across country.\xc2\xa0 So preparing Americans to enter into the manufacturing sector will not only strengthen the economy and get folks back to work, it\xe2\x80\x99s critical to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s success as we compete in a 21st century global economy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have additional details on that probably over the weekend.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then later that day on Wednesday, the President will welcome the Auburn University football team to the White House to celebrate their BCS national championship.\xc2\xa0 That obviously is an event that\'s been rescheduled from last month.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Thursday, the President will welcome President Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon to the White House.\xc2\xa0 We should have turned that one into a little quiz, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the common spelling?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just spelled like it sounds. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The two Presidents will discuss strategic, regional and bilateral topics of mutual importance, including the latest developments in the areas of security, democracy, governance and economic growth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities on Friday later next week.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he talk about the jobs numbers today in Toledo?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is a state visit --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said official --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an official visit?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You know, as I mentioned, the President is going to make some local stops while we\xe2\x80\x99re there and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details on those.\xc2\xa0 Those are OTRs, as we call them.\xc2\xa0 But we will do our best.\xc2\xa0 We have a plan in place to ensure that you guys are informed about what the President is doing as he does them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as I mentioned, the reason for this -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s important not to overlook this -- the reason for this is that the rescue of the auto industry has had significant benefits for the employees of Chrysler and for the company of Chrysler, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also had a significant impact on small businesses in the Toledo area.\xc2\xa0 And if Chrysler -- if we had let Chrysler die, the hardware stores, the grocery stores, the dry cleaners would have been significantly impacted.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so the President is going to take the opportunity to talk to people in the community who even though they don\xe2\x80\x99t work at Chrysler have significantly benefited from the dramatically prompt turnaround of that company.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the pool have access to, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see him on these stops?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR.
