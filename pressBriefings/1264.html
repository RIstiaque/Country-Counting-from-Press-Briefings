GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just one quick housekeeping thing before we get started.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow morning, in here, off-camera, we will do the first of our briefings for the trip to India, with Mike Froman, Ben Rhodes, and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Bill Burns to walk us through some of what the President will do and see and talk about in India.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re likely to do the latter portion of the foreign trip later in the week, the Korea and Japan G20 part a little bit later.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a time?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Embargoed or off-camera or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s off-camera.\xc2\xa0 Let me check on the embargo.\xc2\xa0 My guess is there won\xe2\x80\x99t be one.\xc2\xa0 But it would be on -- it will be on the India portion of the foreign trip.\xc2\xa0 Like I said, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the second part of the trip probably Thursday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Thursday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Froman is not going to be there to talk about the G20 itself?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not tomorrow, no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Separate for Indonesia or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re just focusing on India tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll do sort of post-India, so that -- you\xe2\x80\x99re right, Indonesia, Korea, Japan is all -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the latter part of the week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will that be next week, Robert, or Thursday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s either going to be Thursday or Friday.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My sense at the moment is Thursday.\xc2\xa0 But I will have more on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the volcanoes, the earthquakes and everything going on in Indonesia, is there any concern about that leg?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard any expressed concern about any of those things impacting the trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Two topics.\xc2\xa0 On Afghanistan, can you give us your sense of whether the President supports the U.S. giving bags of cash to Karzai, as the Afghan President said yesterday?\xc2\xa0 What does the President have to say --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, I think you know that the United States provides assistance through U.S. aid and development programs.\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99d steer you away from that characterization of how the United States provides aid to the Afghans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we provide aid through a process that\xe2\x80\x99s appropriated through Congress, goes through steps and helps in a series of development projects and improves democracy and governance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of -- look, we closely monitor what happens in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Those efforts at moderating include making sure that its neighbors do not provide an unnecessary or negative -- don\xe2\x80\x99t exert negative or unnecessary influence on that country.\xc2\xa0 And, look, I would remind all of -- all the countries in that region that they have a responsibility to play a constructive role in the future of Afghanistan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s response to Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s companion assertion that he receives bags of cash from Iran?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, only to say that we closely monitor what happens in Afghanistan and monitor countries that may negatively -- try to negatively influence the country and the future of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You monitor it, but is there a concern that that in fact is what Iran is doing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the intelligence of what we might see.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On domestic politics, can you tell us whether the President has a personal reaction to Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s quote that the single most important thing we have to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ben, I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this before and I think you saw the President -- the President gave an interview to the same publication where Senator McConnell gave an interview and came up with that quote.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I doubt that regardless of the outcome of the election in a week, that the message that the voters of this country are going to send is that they want to see more politics being played, that they want to see the process bogged down and mired in more partisan political games.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our job should be to work together to move this country forward, to strengthen our economy, and to improve the lives of its citizens.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s time for a political campaign now and there will be time in two years for a presidential campaign.\xc2\xa0 But in the days and the weeks and the months after this campaign, the message that voters are going to send and the message that we as elected officials should take is that of working together, of getting things done that are constructive, again, that help strengthen our economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have had over the past two years enough game-playing to satisfy ourselves for many political lifetimes.\xc2\xa0 It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take two extra months to get a small business tax cut and a small business lending package through the United States Senate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a United States Senate that -- where you have co-sponsors of and supporters of a commission to look into the federal deficit, have it come up for a vote and vote against it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been through that for two years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When then-Senator Obama was advocating for Senator Kerry for President prominently, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that what he was trying to do, is make sure that President Bush wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a one-term President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference -- look, again, there will be time for an active presidential campaign, okay?\xc2\xa0 And maybe Senator McConnell is interested in running for President.\xc2\xa0 But if you walk out on the trail during a presidential campaign and advocate for the election or defeat of somebody, that\xe2\x80\x99s the political campaign season.\xc2\xa0 But the political campaign season for the presidency of the United States is not going to be a week and a day from this election, or from right now and the day after this election.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s time for a presidential campaign.\xc2\xa0 There will be time for a political campaign.\xc2\xa0 But members of the Senate are elected and hired by the people of the United States to get stuff done for the people of the United States, not to posture and play political games, gum up the system.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen people who\xe2\x80\x99ve said, look, our goal is gridlock.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what the American people are going to say -- regardless, again, of the outcome on Tuesday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does the White House have a reaction to Iran loading fuel into its first nuclear power plant?\xc2\xa0 Is that a sign that sanctions are not working?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 And, look, we have addressed -- this reactor is monitored by the IAEA with cooperation from Russia.\xc2\xa0 It should not -- again, we have a monitoring -- we have monitoring in place on something that is -- and we believe Iran has the right to produce peaceful nuclear power.\xc2\xa0 That does not let it get out of its responsibilities in international agreements and commitments to step away from an illicit nuclear weapons program.\xc2\xa0 So I would definitely divorce the two things.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at articles over the past several weeks, sanctions are having an impact on the economy of Iran.\xc2\xa0 The President that travels around the world and makes outlandish comments is, in stepping away from his country\xe2\x80\x99s obligations, making it harder for the people of Iran.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the message I think that\xe2\x80\x99s being delivered with sanctions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a follow-up question on a different topic.\xc2\xa0 With the GDP figure coming out on Friday and the elections next week, do you think that Democrats are not getting credit for the economic measures that the White House has taken and/or has the Republican Party been more effective at their economic message?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, their economic message has been \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And that also coordinates with their political agenda in the Senate and in the House.\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I think you can look at the steps that we took, the change in when the President came in where the GDP figure was for that quarter, I think it was somewhere near negative 6 percent.\xc2\xa0 We were losing close to 800,000 jobs the month the President came in.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had nine consecutive months of private sector job growth.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen now a GDP that\xe2\x80\x99s moving and pointing in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, again, Jeff, that having been said, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a surprise that people are frustrated with the pace of where we are, especially given the depth of where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be remedied -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be remedied overnight.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the question is, why are the Democrats not getting some credit for that?\xc2\xa0 And is that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think -- I think because when you make some progress from very deep in a hole, you\xe2\x80\x99re still in a hole.\xc2\xa0 This was not a shallow recession.\xc2\xa0 This was not a recession that saw an increase in unemployment.\xc2\xa0 We saw -- or just an increase in unemployment.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to describe the sort of magnitude of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, 8 million jobs lost as a result of bad economic decisions -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a hole that will take a long time to fill.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve filled in part of that hole.\xc2\xa0 But for many people who watched their economic well-being eroded not just since a bank collapsed in New York but over many, many years, there\xe2\x80\x99s a logical frustration that is built up, and progress in coming out of that hole has not been as fast as they would like, it\xe2\x80\x99s not been as fast as the President would like.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President tell the story on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 The car is out of the ditch and it\xe2\x80\x99s pointing in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Heard that once or twice, yes.\xc2\xa0 The question is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even go into the Slurpees, but it was --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question is, are the Republicans -- have they been more successful than Democrats at whether they would agree with your description of your economic message or not and getting -- and harnessing that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just described -- I just simply described their votes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in harnessing -- or presenting their economic or taking advantage of the economic conditions to help their electoral --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think they are -- again, I think we have a -- the political environment has been determined largely by the economic environment, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one of frustration.\xc2\xa0 I think we would all readily agree with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans are for voting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He just voted absentee in the West Wing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who did he vote for?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I did not ask.\xc2\xa0 I assume that\xe2\x80\x99s a private decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because we know now he\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily a straight Democratic ticket guy, right?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he voted independent or not.\xc2\xa0 No, I can assure you, I know who he voted for governor and Senate in Illinois -- the two Democratic candidates who I believe will win.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President have any reaction to the comments from Governor Manchin yesterday in which he refused to say that he would endorse President Obama for reelection in 2012?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I did not hear anything from the President on that.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a long way to go before 2012, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that would cause the President to lose a lot of sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, to follow up on the story about the Republicans driving the car into the ditch, the President has now been behind the wheel of this car for two years.\xc2\xa0 At what point does he stop --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, just -- I would say pushing the car out of the ditch first, right?\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but he has been trying to move the car --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be faithful to the story.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he has been moving the car -- he has been moving this car now for two years.\xc2\xa0 At what point does he stop talking about the people who were last driving that car?\xc2\xa0 I mean, does this continue after the midterm elections?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Dan --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It becomes his car and he\xe2\x80\x99s behind the wheel.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, and -- look, there\xe2\x80\x99s an Obama bumper sticker on the car; we get that.\xc2\xa0 But, Dan, inherent in your question is somehow that on January 20th everything reset to zero and we all got to start all over again.\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case, right?\xc2\xa0 We watched an economy from December 2007 through -- I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this off the top of my head -- probably sometime in the fall of 2009 lose jobs every single month, right?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve now had nine consecutive months of positive job growth, and probably -- I know there was one month in there -- so it\xe2\x80\x99s probably like 11 of 12 or 12 of 13 -- I\xe2\x80\x99d have to go back and look at the exact graph.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, Dan, the President has taken responsibility for the steps that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken since coming into office.\xc2\xa0 But the six months before he got into office we lost 4 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, you can\xe2\x80\x99t reset the frustration involved with somebody who lost their job in that time period, can you?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s just --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At what point does he stop talking about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No -- well, the record of the last eight years was pretty broken, I would give you that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think keeping -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think repeating how we got into this mess, partly because we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to repeat it.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying this because I want to re-litigate, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to re-live it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s message in this campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, let\xe2\x80\x99s take, for instance -- leaving aside that the chairman of the House campaign committee said, our goal was to go back to the agenda of what we had before the President came into office -- Senator Cornyn, the head of the Republican Senate Campaign Committee, has said one of the first things we ought to do is repeal Wall Street reform.\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what got us into this mess -- a series of rules and regulations that didn\xe2\x80\x99t impact anybody\xe2\x80\x99s behavior and handed taxpayers the bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to change that.\xc2\xa0 And we change that in this legislation, and we\xe2\x80\x99re putting people in charge of things like the consumer agency that can advocate on behalf of middle-class workers, middle-class families, middle-class taxpayers, not for fly-by-night lenders or getting suckered into mortgages that they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re putting somebody on the side of the middle class.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to walk away from that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what got us into this mess.\xc2\xa0 And, look, I think the President will continue to talk about it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s how we got where we are.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President will be on a radio show with Al Sharpton this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Does he feel like he has to shore up support among African Americans?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not following you, Wendell.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- talking to different people?\xc2\xa0 Has the President basically conceded that he needs to reach out to his base more than independents now?\xc2\xa0 Is that the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because we tell the -- you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to help me understand this, Wendell.\xc2\xa0 We tell the story about getting the car out of the ditch, which is a metaphor for the economy, that he is appealing to his base rather than independents?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the fact that -- the Slurpees, shall we bring in the Slurpee then, and Republicans standing on the sidelines, okay, Republicans riding in the backseat.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we said the middle class would be in the front seat, which would be a departure from where the middle class rode during most of the Bush administration.\xc2\xa0 And I think we said as much in 2008 during the campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to concede more focus --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this, Mark called 7-Eleven and they declined to comment specifically that Slurpees were a Republican drink, right?\xc2\xa0 That is true.\xc2\xa0 That is true.\xc2\xa0 So I guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t follow your Slurpee contention.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President appealing more to his base now because he has despaired of the support of independents?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to follow what you are laying out in the question, Wendell.\xc2\xa0 But the President is seeking the votes of everybody in this election.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not just appealing to one group of people.\xc2\xa0 The President, the actions that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken, the decisions that he\xe2\x80\x99s made, were the right decisions, the right thing to do in a tough economic environment, and we hope it appeals to everybody.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?\xc2\xa0 In the last few speeches, President Obama upped the ante, saying not only are Republicans not helping pull the economy out of the ditch, fanning themselves, sipping Slurpees, but the last few speeches he has them kicking dirt in his face from above.\xc2\xa0 I mean, where is this going?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s next?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hope there is an ad for the last weekend on the story.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- my sense, Mark, is that the President added part of that into the speech, because I think to just simply assume that for the past two years all the Republicans did was sit by and not do anything tells only part of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They voted against every one of these things.\xc2\xa0 Again, they voted -- I go to Mitch McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s what the future is going to look like\xe2\x80\x9d to explain apparently what he believes his job is as the leader of his party in the Senate, leaving aside, again, the fact that if at any point two years ago, four years ago, six years ago, you would have said to Mitch McConnell, do you support cutting capital gains taxes on small business -- if you were in a town hall meeting and you asked that question, do you think the first word out of your mouth would be anything besides yes? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a series of political games that get played in this town and the Republicans have played a lot of them.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they would mischaracterize the fact that they tried at every effort to help get the car out of the ditch.\xc2\xa0 Many of them are running a campaign exactly on that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve just illuminated it in a story and added Slurpees for a laugh.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And kicking dirt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And kicking dirt and putting them in the backseat so the middle class can ride shotgun in the front I think is a pretty good representation of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened over the past two years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So two quick questions, one going back to Caprio in Rhode Island.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing not to endorse the Democratic candidate, but I guess the question is why go to Rhode Island at all?\xc2\xa0 It seems like it\xe2\x80\x99s throwing the non-endorsement in his face.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We went to -- we went there for a DCCC fundraiser.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you could have raised money somewhere else, correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, except that\xe2\x80\x99s where the DCCC wanted us to go to raise money.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Well, second question, going back to the McConnell issue and the relationship with Republicans, setting aside any predictions about what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen next week on November 2nd, putting that all aside, what changes -- how is the President going to approach the relationship with Republicans differently?\xc2\xa0 What changes will he make?\xc2\xa0 And how do you balance trying to work with Republicans on one side and then not angering or further angering the Democratic base on the other side, who some of them think he spent a lot of time trying to work with Republicans already?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of time to get into operational changes.\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think if you just read the interviews -- just read the two interviews side by side.\xc2\xa0 A President that regardless of the outcome wants to sit down, work with Republicans, find common ground, figure out how we can work together to move this country forward, versus somebody who has decided that his first job as leader of his -- of the Senate for the Republican Party, regardless, again, of the outcome, is to defeat the President and keep him as only a one-term President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, the job of the President and the job of any senator or any member of the House after this election is going to be solving the problems of this country, of which we know there are quite a few that need to be addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how do you do that if you already know what McConnell has said?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what will change from the White House\xe2\x80\x99s approach?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask Senator McConnell how he\xe2\x80\x99s going to approach this differently given what he said and given the fact that the President said he looks forward to sitting down and working with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That goes back, again, to some of our earliest -- some of the earliest time that we spent here in the White House in trying to get their support for a Recovery Act, trying to get their support for passing middle-class tax cuts to spur consumer demand.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot of the things, quite frankly, that they\xe2\x80\x99ve always said they were for -- increases in infrastructure investments -- all of those things, I can assure you that when the political and election season has passed, and we get the next day into -- back into the governing of this country, that this is a President that will reach out to -- as he did and try as best as he can to work with the Republican Party because I think at the end of the day, the President strongly believes that there is enough common ground to be found to help move this country forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Republicans are going to have to ask themselves the posture they\xe2\x80\x99re going to take.\xc2\xa0 I would say that the first message that has come from Senator McConnell is one of -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a deeply disappointing message that regardless of the outcome of this election, political gridlock and political gamesmanship is what the American people have to look forward to over the next two years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Serious question.\xc2\xa0 If President Obama --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jonathan, again, let\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to not -- look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve described this before.\xc2\xa0 There is a natural, as you know in covering both Washington and the White House -- there is a natural churning of personnel inside this building, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think the notion of -- look, people leave for a hundred different reasons, right?\xc2\xa0 Some people, as we know, are leaving because they were going to serve for two years and that two years is up.\xc2\xa0 They have opportunities that they walked away from in academia or in business or in anything, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to return to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99d overly read into the fact that people are leaving as somehow the -- those involved in policy are somehow leaving in a disproportionate level to other positions.\xc2\xa0 There are also eminently more policy positions in this White House and in this administration than anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, do you believe that there might be -- or there is a need for some change in communications strategy if the President of the United States is talking --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I should do this as a senior administration official.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the President of the United States is saying out loud that there seems to be a problem with communications, where does that leave you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think what -- look, it is -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard others, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say this, it is -- we were confronted with a lot of things very quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, you could imagine what was encompassed in a Recovery Act -- the size of, the breadth of that is something that you could have spent months flying around the country touting the proposals contained in something like that before Congress ever considered it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We were afforded -- we weren\xe2\x80\x99t afforded that opportunity because the economy was contracting at such a rate that ours was to get into the bloodstream that investment as quickly as possible in a way that was effective, but also in a way that ensured that we weren\xe2\x80\x99t seeing waste, fraud and abuse.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- but, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s all overlaid on a very tough political climate.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve faced from the get-go.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that those are going to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to change much next week or two weeks after that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still going to have a lot of challenges.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is getting out the vote the singular objective of the last week of the campaign?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think this is a -- I think it would be fair to say that that is probably the -- probably on the top of every to-do list of every person working in a campaign at any point in the country.\xc2\xa0 This is -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve identified who your voters are, and now it is time to make sure that if they have an early vote opportunity, if they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be there for the election -- like the President is and just voted -- and to get them motivated to show up on Election Day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And The Daily Show is part of that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I think the -- we have -- two things.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a constituency of younger voters that watch that show, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a good place to go and reach them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, look, sort of ancillary to that, my second point, which is -- whether it is -- whether you\xe2\x80\x99re doing something like The View, or you\xe2\x80\x99re doing something like The Daily Show, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to tell you guys that not everybody -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of different channels for people to watch these days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They get their information from not just television news and cable and newspapers and radio and the Internet.\xc2\xa0 They get them from -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of different places.\xc2\xa0 And the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been shy about going to the places where people are getting their information and trying to make his case.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99ll do on the show.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask an economy and trade question.\xc2\xa0 China has moved to limit its exports of something called rare earth.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s 17 different minerals.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re familiar with it a little bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Used in everything from flat-screen TVs to smart bombs.\xc2\xa0 It has military implications and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration concerned about it?\xc2\xa0 And if so, are you looking into it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this, Roger -- and you guys had this question last week.\xc2\xa0 NSC has seen the reports and is monitoring to see whether something like that is happening.\xc2\xa0 And they continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any update past some of those reports from last week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as I said -- or as you said -- these are important in the production of a whole host of things and obviously something that NEC and NSC will monitor.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this a question of not being assured that they have reduced exports?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think it is -- again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports and we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring to see whether or not those -- whether or not what is happening on the ground is reflected in those reports.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this something that could come up -- or be part of the agenda at either G20 this month, or when the -- Hu Jintao comes to Washington next year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we are likely to see President Hu on the trip at the G20.\xc2\xa0 Look, if it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the security and economic teams think is important, in terms of where those reports are, certainly we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to bring it up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess my bottom line is we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring to see whether those reports are, indeed, the case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is concern --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s concern to monitor to see if the reports are true.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- it\xe2\x80\x99s -- and they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do something on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I follow up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just about The Daily Show interview.\xc2\xa0 You explained kind of the President\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for going on it.\xc2\xa0 It does coincide with the run-up to this big rally that he\xe2\x80\x99s having over the weekend. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Jon Stewart announced a long, long time ago that he would be in Washington before the existence of the rally.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s when we -- we signed up to do the show many months ago, I think long before the existence of the rally.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But does the President -- first of all, does the President have any opinion or even an understanding of what the rally\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is, and whether it\xe2\x80\x99s something that he thinks would be useful to the Democrats?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not talked to the President about the rally.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what his opinion is on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And just another follow-up.\xc2\xa0 The President is going on another kind of blue state tour over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 Can you just --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure -- I appreciate --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, most of them --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- that Ohio is blue.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, okay.\xc2\xa0 With the exception of Ohio, there are a lot of blue states --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s necessarily been, say, the hue of that state on election nights.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Connecticut, Illinois -- I mean, states that he won.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget Ohio.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget Ohio.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- sort of a -- kind of a big state.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, Illinois, Connecticut, Pennsylvania -- what are the -- and then Ohio.\xc2\xa0 Can you just talk about why he\xe2\x80\x99s doing what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing in the last weekend?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, there -- these are all important races.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, I think you could -- I think it would be accurate to say that Pennsylvania is a battleground state.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s up for a lot of discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, look, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got important close races in each of these places.\xc2\xa0 And the President will -- I think you -- many of you guys -- some of you were certainly on the trip.\xc2\xa0 Some of you certainly saw I think the President making a strong case for Democrats in this election over the past several days in Portland, in Seattle, in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Minneapolis.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly continues in races that are close and are of concern to this White House.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what kind of briefings, if any, is the President getting on the state of play in the races and the elections?\xc2\xa0 Are you adding any sit-downs with the political team?\xc2\xa0 How much is he kept up to date on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s -- he generally gets a quick update in -- on a fairly regular basis in the senior advisor meeting that takes in the Oval Office, usually most mornings.\xc2\xa0 I think today it got pushed back until later this afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And certainly on the road, people give him updates on what he\xe2\x80\x99s -- on what they\xe2\x80\x99re hearing and what they\xe2\x80\x99re getting -- the information that they get from the national party, state parties or the individual campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how much is he involved in deciding where he is going in these last days, versus simply just responding to requests from, say, the DCCC or the DNC or -- how involved is he?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We I think put together a sketch for where we thought would be an important -- where would be important stops for this last weekend.\xc2\xa0 But he was not, to my recollection, involved in, oh, we should go here rather than here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not usually how he does that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a housekeeping thing on the Stewart interview.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- I assume that\xe2\x80\x99s a closed press thing?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s doing in the venue before a live -- before an audience, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe so, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would we see it, contemporaneously?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In other words, there will be people in the audience who -- for the show -- who will witness the President being interviewed.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering will reporters be allowed to be in the room --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and witness the President being interviewed?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the last time that The New York Times was in the Oval Office, whether we did a print pool, but --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you ordinarily wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I know -- I know --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But sometimes you\xe2\x80\x99d make a transcript --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when The New York Times goes into the Oval Office you don\xe2\x80\x99t invite members of the public.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sheryl, Sheryl, I\xe2\x80\x99m just kidding.\xc2\xa0 We could.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We could, it\xe2\x80\x99d be fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Seriously, in all honesty, let me check on the coverage.\xc2\xa0 We would generally put out a transcript.\xc2\xa0 So let me check on that and I will get back to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does the President not have any concern about the conflation of entertainment comedy and politics?\xc2\xa0 Does that -- does it take away from the seriousness?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jon Stewart is sort of past that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just about the interview, but the weekend as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, to the extent that a leading comedian is holding a political rally -- no concern about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily, no.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had entertainers join things like Rock the Vote to help register people to vote and help get people involved.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President would tell you that we have a very special gift in our democracy that the people get to render their judgment and they get to elect those that will represent them in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And efforts that help get people involved in and excited in participating in that democracy on either side is a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of comedians, David Axelrod in his web chat -- that well-known comedian.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You lost me on that one.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Axelrod talked about Republicans will no doubt find greater parity on Capitol Hill after Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 And he said that will be met with a \xe2\x80\x9cwelcoming hand from us.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Will the President do something on Wednesday, the day after the election, to put aside the car in the ditch and extend some kind of welcoming hand?\xc2\xa0 Republican leaders will be here in Washington.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the -- what the schedule is for that day.\xc2\xa0 But as we get closer, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have something to say about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, but I will say this, Ann, again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this in several interviews that the President has given over the last few weeks and certainly, again, the one that is juxtaposed with the interview that Senator McConnell did.\xc2\xa0 And that is, look, where there\xe2\x80\x99s a political season, that political season on election -- after the Election Day will be over.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now we\xe2\x80\x99re in a season of governing on behalf of the American people, Democrat and Republican.\xc2\xa0 And I think he was pretty clear about his desire to do all that he can and hopes they will do all that they can to work together to move this country forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But will he do something to encourage that in a day or two before he leaves for --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a final schedule.\xc2\xa0 I would assume we will have stuff on that.\xc2\xa0 I just -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no specifics as of yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how will he watch the returns on Tuesday?\xc2\xa0 Does he plan to come in here and make any statements during the evening?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any plans to come in here that evening.\xc2\xa0 And I assume he\xe2\x80\x99ll be either in the Residence or in the West Wing.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not usually one to sit by the TV and watch over and over and over again.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll usually get -- sometimes he does, most times he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 He certainly will get written updates or email updates from us.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in fairly regular communication with him that night.\xc2\xa0 I do not anticipate -- at least not that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard -- that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in here that night.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you anticipating Wednesday or Thursday for him to -- or you don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the final answer to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d I understand the meeting is taking place today between the White House and repeal advocates.\xc2\xa0 What commitments is the White House going to be offering during this meeting in the effort to repeal the law?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, likely the same commitments that I\xe2\x80\x99ve enumerated in here, and that is our desire to see the defense authorization bill pending before the Senate taken up.\xc2\xa0 That includes a repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d as the House has already voted on.\xc2\xa0 The President wants the defense authorization act and that repeal passed.\xc2\xa0 That is the basis for the meeting today.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President and the administration have committed to working to see that through.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on that.\xc2\xa0 Is among the commitments -- is among the commitments reaching out to senators who may have voted no in September to get them to change their votes to vote yes in the lame duck?\xc2\xa0 Has that taken place yet? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not to my knowledge.\xc2\xa0 To my knowledge, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken place yet.\xc2\xa0 But, look, the only way we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get something through the Senate is to change the vote count and to move past -- look, you got to get -- you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to get past a promised filibuster and -- in moving to the bill.\xc2\xa0 And certainly the only way we can move to that bill is to change some of those votes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been reported that any discussion of litigation on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d during this meeting would terminate the discussion.\xc2\xa0 Why is that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, understand that some of the participants in the meeting are with groups that are in litigation as the plaintiff where the United States government is the defendant.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think either side believes that those type of conversations about the litigation between two parties represented in a lawsuit is appropriate at the meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who initiated the meeting, you or them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I can check.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Karen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question, is the President expecting --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You got to move up to front row.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President expecting repeal legislation on his desk by the end of this year regardless of what happens at the polls next week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s our hope.\xc2\xa0 Again, our desire and our hope and the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment is that he will work to see this pass.\xc2\xa0 This is -- look, we are -- we\xe2\x80\x99re approaching the beginning of December, which is when the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s study of implementation and of the attitudes of the military will be complete.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes, continues to believe, that this is a law that -- the end of this law -- that time for the ending of this law has come.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The courts are signaling that.\xc2\xa0 And certainly it\xe2\x80\x99s been his political belief going back -- when I met him in 2004, that was his position.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a -- we might have covered it, but go ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 Of course not, of course not.\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 Any sense of what that report looks like?\xc2\xa0 Has anyone in the White House had a chance to see some of the prelims of that DOD report?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not to my knowledge.\xc2\xa0 The last time I heard about this, nobody in this building had seen that, no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of contingency planning, I know this is your favorite subject, but, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s a very real possibility this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go through.\xc2\xa0 I know you guys want it to, I know that\xe2\x80\x99s the meeting today.\xc2\xa0 But if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go through, I mean, is something like stop-loss on the table?\xc2\xa0 Perfectly within the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority, by the way, during a time of war.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- look, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen steps that have been taken over the past several days at the Pentagon involving service secretaries.\xc2\xa0 You have for -- you have a sitting chair of the Joint Chiefs that believes it\xe2\x80\x99s time for this law to end; the President working closely with the Secretary to make that happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And our efforts in the short term will be focused on the durable repeal of a law that the President thinks is unjust, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where our focus will be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Some analysts say that because of concern about China\xe2\x80\x99s (inaudible) currency that U.S. is taking tougher stand toward China.\xc2\xa0 So has the administration changed their policy toward China?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look -- in terms of currency?\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had this discussion in here, and we will have this discussion for the foreseeable future, and that is our belief that China must move.\xc2\xa0 And that is communicated in our dealings with the Chinese government, whether it is in a meeting with the President, whether that is with Secretary Geithner or National Security Advisor Tom Donilon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is -- our position is that has to change.\xc2\xa0 And the House before leaving weighed in that it\xe2\x80\x99s of concern to members on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President believes that that simply demonstrates the widespread concern of people here in this country of leaders of the Chinese needing to take action on this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Amnesty International is demanding that Pakistan investigate the torture and killing of 40 politicians, activists in Baluchistan.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration backing that demand?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some guidance.\xc2\xa0 I have not seen that from the ACLU.\xc2\xa0 Let me get some guidance on that.\xc2\xa0 I will say this, if it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- it may have already gone out -- the President did speak with President Zardari late this morning, and there is a readout of that call that we\xe2\x80\x99ll -- again, if it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone out, it will go out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow the region?\xc2\xa0 India?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go there and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with Ken.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, are you leaving Monday open for the possibility of adding something GOTV-wise?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely be down?\xc2\xa0 And if I could just ask you another question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying this is a reflection of what may or may not have happened yesterday in Rhode Island, but is this the way the White House anticipated the home stretch to look?\xc2\xa0 Is this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 According to the blocking strategy, according to the way you figured the closing arguments would go coming out of here, the role of the President in the effort, or is it a -- has it become a Hail Mary pass at this point?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President deployed in different races is much as we expected the President would be used.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think there were -- I think if you looked at last week\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think it was an AP poll that showed when you asked people the role that the President played in their voting, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a huge role on either side.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes that if he can certainly be helpful in getting our voters out for support, that that\xe2\x80\x99s a role that he should play and can play and certainly will play.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think it has gone out -- we\xe2\x80\x99re likely to add a stop Friday in Charlottesville for Congressman Perriello, but I do not anticipate that Monday -- I anticipate the President will be here working on different topics.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tommy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, was it press reports --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me call on Tommy real fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you come back to me?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I got to be truthful, Lester.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to put all my chips on a commitment I\xe2\x80\x99m unable to keep.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have three quick ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Welcome back, by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I feel great.\xc2\xa0 First question, there\xe2\x80\x99s apparently a lot of outrage building over the President\xe2\x80\x99s addition of -- to the car story of the Republicans riding in the back.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s new, but apparently now people are upset about it.\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99re casting it even as some sort of a civil rights reference.\xc2\xa0 Are you aware of this?\xc2\xa0 Megyn Kelly on FOX said specifically she wanted to know what Gibbs would have to say about it, so --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, Megyn can come out to a rally, but -- and you hear -- I almost looked at Mark because he\xe2\x80\x99s sort of the aficionado on the ditch story.\xc2\xa0 But the President says -- and I think he said it this weekend -- that Republicans are going to ride in the back and the middle class is going to ride up front in the passenger seat.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly concerned about backseat driving in that scenario, but it is what it is.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll like this question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am going to like this question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, you\xe2\x80\x99ll like the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My sponsors tell me I should tell people that I\xe2\x80\x99m not calling on them generally because I think I may or may not like it.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, my second question is, regarding Leader McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, the President has talked about -- well, prior to these remarks, that he hopes that following the midterms that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to work with Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And given McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the case.\xc2\xa0 What sort of hope can you offer people that anything will get -- is going to get done in the next two years?\xc2\xa0 It sort of seems like you can\xe2\x80\x99t get much done now without --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Tommy, I think that -- let\xe2\x80\x99s look back at any of the elections that -- look back at the last four or five elections.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think at any point, regardless of the outcome, people took from that election that what they wanted to see was an increase in political gamesmanship and gridlock.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there\xe2\x80\x99s any chance that that\xe2\x80\x99s the message coming out of this campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that the American people are going to want people that can sit down in a room together, find common ground -- nobody is asking anybody to leave their principles or their values or their otherwise strong beliefs at the door, but let\xe2\x80\x99s sit down and look for where the two -- where the ideas may overlap and see if we can move forward on that.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the President\xe2\x80\x99s hope.\xc2\xa0 I hope that Senator McConnell will reconsider what looks at this point to be his view of going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the last one is really quick.\xc2\xa0 Is there any chance the President is going to put in an appearance at the rally?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Put in an appearance?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the rally to restore honor/fear -- sanity and fear.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be flying around to the other states.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go David and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Lester.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m setting you up here, Les.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re the straight guy.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the interview that came out yesterday, the President said that we have to -- that he has to have humility about what we can accomplish.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you can explain that a little, and also square that with some of his favorite statements from the past when he talked about the \xe2\x80\x9cfierce urgency of now\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9caudacity of hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How can you do that and be humble at the same time?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, because -- look, David, I would explain this I think the same way that David Axelrod explained this I think when he was asked this morning, is this is a President that came to Washington wanting to work with the other side.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we have -- look, we were criticized for wanting that for too long on health care.\xc2\xa0 We were criticized -- the President sought to get support of Republicans for the Recovery Act in going to Capitol Hill even after they said en masse that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to support it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not going to -- that didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop the President then; it won\xe2\x80\x99t stop the President after this election trying to sit down and work with Republicans and Democrats alike who want to move the country forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That does not mean that we can\xe2\x80\x99t do important things.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we can\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, I think you could -- and I would make the case that the only way you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get progress on things like energy, the only way you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make progress on comprehensive immigration reform, the only way you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make real progress on getting our fiscal house in order is to do so together.\xc2\xa0 There is not a scenario where only one group of people can move this country forward and govern this country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As it is noticed and has been said, regardless of what the outcome is, there is going to be greater parity, which means everyone is going to have to work together.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on these important issues, there has been disparity between the two parties and the two sides that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t overcome when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a political advantage.\xc2\xa0 Under what set of circumstances does this greater parity increase the odds of working with the other side that says again and again, it rejects some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s key policies and key ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, David, first and foremost, we understand -- look, if you look back at the past two years, you\xe2\x80\x99ve needed 60 votes to pass a bill that required 50, right?\xc2\xa0 That at every step of the way, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get past that.\xc2\xa0 Again, maybe that had something to do with the fact that there were 60 or 59 Democrats, but we are going to be in a situation -- again, regardless of the outcome -- that will require progress to be made only by working -- where that\xe2\x80\x99s possible only through working together.\xc2\xa0 And I think that any party, again, coming out of this election that believes that the message that voters send is screeching everything to a halt, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what -- that is not what their message will be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the experience of the last two years lead you to the conclusion that it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be any better in the next two years and may be even worse?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will be easy, Bill.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody here is na\xc3\xafve that it won\xe2\x80\x99t take some hard work.\xc2\xa0 And my point is it will take hard work on both sides.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I cannot conceive of somebody walking out of Election Night, regardless of how -- of what the final score is and believing, you know what, the voters have spoken, grind everything to a halt, political gridlock, nothing happens for two years -- no nominees, no budget, no progress on energy, no progress on putting our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 Everything just stays the same.\xc2\xa0 We all just yell and scream at each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there are people --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be an exit poll that shows that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Robert, there are people running -- there are people running to block Obama.\xc2\xa0 And some may or may not win.\xc2\xa0 And if they\xe2\x80\x99re in the Senate, that would give the obstructionists even more power.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But, again --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re gilding the lily a little here.\xc2\xa0 Maybe a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I simply took Mitch McConnell at his word that that\xe2\x80\x99s what he wanted to do, right?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he said in an interview in the same publication where the President said it was time to work together.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the message that voters are going to send.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more, Lester, and then --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Poor Ben has been trying to get me out of here for hours.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it -- I have a two-part.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Was it press reports --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You said I\xe2\x80\x99d like this question, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say which part.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You just put an and in between them and we\xe2\x80\x99ll --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it press reports of the President\xe2\x80\x99s repeatedly dropping any mention of the Creator in referring to the Declaration of Independence that led him to commendably restore it in four speeches this weekend?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, I think the President has at certain times quoted from and at other times paraphrased the Declaration.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read anything into it, much as I didn\xe2\x80\x99t read anything into it when on a couple of the speeches in this trip, somehow the Slurpee got dropped.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today in Baltimore, 52 percent of the 16- to 19-year-old African Americans cannot find a job, reported the Washington Examiner.\xc2\xa0 Since these are United States citizens, does the President agree or disagree with Governor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s repeated description of illegal aliens as new Americans?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- I neither saw the story or what Governor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley has said.\xc2\xa0 I think that there are -- I think Governor O\xe2\x80\x99Malley is somebody who has lent his voice, as Democrats and Republicans have lent their voice, to dealing with the immigration reform --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Illegal aliens --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
