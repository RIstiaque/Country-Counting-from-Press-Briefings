MDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So this our regular gaggle.\xc2\xa0 We have an addition to myself and Jen -- we have David Plouffe with you today, who will be happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>I have no official announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 Jen.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 So good morning.\xc2\xa0 Because Glenn Thrush is here, Plouffe wanted to come back and visit with him.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m joking.</p>\n<p>So before we get started, I just wanted to make sure you all saw that we have a new ad up today.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s out; it\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cTrust.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s running in seven states -- you know the states.\xc2\xa0 We have it out there to remind the American people that Mitt Romney is not leveling with them about his tax plan.\xc2\xa0 We know he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be out there telling the truth, but we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to tell the truth for him.\xc2\xa0 I know you like visual aids.\xc2\xa0 It takes 30 seconds, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to show you the ad real fast.</p>\n<p>(Campaign ad is played.)</p>\n<p>Well, all right.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it, okay?\xc2\xa0 The second thing I just wanted to highlight proactively for you is, to be crystal clear, when the President spoke at the event today, he was highlighting the fact that Mitt Romney is hiding his plans, not that he\xe2\x80\x99s changing his plans or positions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be out there over the next days and weeks highlighting the fact that Mitt Romney is not willing to level with the American people about the truth about his $5 trillion tax plan, his plans to voucherize Medicare, his plans to cut education funding.\xc2\xa0 And if he\xe2\x80\x99s not willing to do it, we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to.</p>\n<p>So I know you have lots of questions for our special guest.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it on over.</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jen.\xc2\xa0 Hey, everybody.\xc2\xa0 So just a couple of words about the debate, this morning, where we\xe2\x80\x99re going.\xc2\xa0 I think we viewed this entire campaign as all of a piece.\xc2\xa0 So we set out, back in the spring, to begin to talk to the American people about the President\xe2\x80\x99s record, where he wants to take the country, and how that contrasts with Governor Romney\xe2\x80\x99s record, vision.</p>\n<p>We think last night the President talked to the American people about his jobs plans, why Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s plan would be devastating for the middle class, that he just wants to continue trickle down.\xc2\xa0 And also, some of the key issues that have been driving vote in battleground states and that are important to the electorate -- issues like Medicare vouchers, issues like outsourcing.\xc2\xa0 So Mitt Romney doubled down on those last night.</p>\n<p>I think the remarkable thing was the fact that the centerpiece of his campaign and of his economic strategy, he tried to pretend it didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist last night.\xc2\xa0 And so now, not only are we going to have the ability to continue to remind people that Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s economic plan would be to give huge tax cuts to the wealthy and punish the middle class, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not being honest about it.</p>\n<p>And so, going forward here, one of the things we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to adjust to is that dishonesty.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to remember a time in American politics where you had someone who\xe2\x80\x99s a major nominee for the presidency being that fundamentally dishonest about core parts of his campaign platform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we look forward to -- later today in Madison, tomorrow in a couple of battleground states, throughout next week and as we head into the next debate, continuing to make sure that we explain to people the fundamental differences in this race.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d say there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of commentary on Governor Romney\xe2\x80\x99s performance.\xc2\xa0 We thought he did a very theatrically aggressive performance.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to change minds in places like Ohio, in Nevada, Virginia.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see.</p>\n<p>But that\xe2\x80\x99s the measure.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to take the lead in Ohio?\xc2\xa0 If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be President.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to take the lead in Iowa?\xc2\xa0 Can he put together an Electoral College puzzle in the majority?\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s really the question here.\xc2\xa0 And I think for voters out there who are concerned about Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s Medicare voucher plan, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be doubly concerned today because he doubled down on it.\xc2\xa0 For those concerned about Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s trustworthiness and his honesty, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that that\xe2\x80\x99s been enhanced.\xc2\xa0 For those that worried about does he have a good plan for the middle class, we think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to carry forward here, as the President did this morning, and make sure people understand these fundamental differences.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would you say that the President went into the debate not expecting Mitt Romney to be as aggressive as he was, or to take those positions?\xc2\xa0 And do you think that the President missed an opportunity to make the points he made today in Denver, and presumably will in Wisconsin, on that stage in front of a much wider audience?</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President made some very important points last night.\xc2\xa0 I think he -- Romney was on the defensive about his tax cut plan, on the defensive about Medicare, on the defensive about outsourcing tax breaks.\xc2\xa0 We expected an aggressive Mitt Romney.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s who he is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And in the primary, it was clear that the truth was really not his primary concern.\xc2\xa0 But I still think that it was remarkable to see him start the debate, essentially, after the pleasantry, saying, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a $5 trillion tax cut plan.\xc2\xa0 Think about that.\xc2\xa0 And my hope is all of you bear down on that, because this is the fundamental economic idea he has, and to say it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist is a remarkable thing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just remarkable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President say that last night?</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he did say that that\xe2\x80\x99s not possible, that\xe2\x80\x99s your plan.\xc2\xa0 The math doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add up.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a case we\xe2\x80\x99ve been making, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make that case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you on the same vein?\xc2\xa0 You know him well, better than most people.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that he has a harder time with direct confrontation, face to face on a stage, than he does with a speech with prepared remarks?\xc2\xa0 Or was it not that -- was it a strategic choice that polling showed that if you go too negative it\xe2\x80\x99s bad, and he just didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go there, and overcompensated?\xc2\xa0 Was it a rope-a-dope strategy?\xc2\xa0 What happened -- something happened.\xc2\xa0 What happened?</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, you guys treated this as kind of theater, but we were serious about what we said, which is one of Romney\'s strengths is he\'s a very good debater.\xc2\xa0 We watched him carefully in his primary and he was skilled at that format.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at -- compare his primary to our primary in 2008, he consistently won his debates.\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always the case for us, as you know, for those of you that covered us.\xc2\xa0 So this is a format that kind of I think plays to his strength.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think with the President -- but to say that -- the President did make very clear and challenge him on his tax cut plan, on Medicare vouchers, on outsourcing tax breaks, on tax cuts and tax breaks for oil companies.\xc2\xa0 So some of the things that are consistent themes in our campaign, I think the President made pretty clear last night that Romney\'s direction is the wrong direction.</p>\n<p>So I think that Romney\'s performance was one that\'s probably unprecedented in its dishonesty.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'re going to have to make sure people understand that despite his suggestion last night that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean much of what he said, this is what he\'s going to do as President -- the Ryan budget, he said he\'d sign it into law.\xc2\xa0 His huge tax cut plan for the wealthy, that\'s been the centerpiece of his campaign.\xc2\xa0 Medicare vouchers -- I\'ll give him credit, he actually doubled down on that last night, and I\'m sure the people of Florida were interested to hear that.</p>\n<p>So we\'re just going to -- again, we see all this as of a piece, and today, tomorrow, all of one piece.\xc2\xa0 And I think, again, in terms of Governor Romney winning Ohio, the same concerns people had about him last -- yesterday, they still have this morning:\xc2\xa0 Medicare vouchers, tax cuts for the wealthy, opposition to the auto rescue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so we think that this is a serious election; people are taking it very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And while Governor Romney might have put forth a performance that\'s graded as an aggressive one last night, we don\'t think that that fundamentally alters the race.\xc2\xa0 That\'s our sense anyway.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 David, it\'s been four years since your guy has been on a debate stage.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve been very assiduously sort of managing the kind of interactions he\'s had with the press and with other politicians.\xc2\xa0 Do you think to some extent your guy was soft?</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think so.\xc2\xa0 I think he -- first of all, over the course of his presidency he\'s done innumerable interviews and press conferences and TV interviews</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- numerable?</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 -- numerable -- sorry, you know a lot of them.\xc2\xa0 A lot in the last few months -- we\'ve done a lot of interviews.</p>\n<p>So, no -- I think that the President wanted to make a case about where we are in the country, where we need to go, have a dialogue with the American people about his ideas, how those contrast with Governor Romney.</p>\n<p>And listen, I do think some of this was baked into the cake -- and you guys may disagree with this, and I say it respectfully.\xc2\xa0 I said it over the weekend -- people are itching to write the Romney comeback story, so it was already leaning in that direction.\xc2\xa0 And voters expected Romney to lose this debate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is what we faced in \'08.\xc2\xa0 When we went into our first foreign policy debate with John McCain, voters expected John McCain to win.\xc2\xa0 We no doubt benefited from that.\xc2\xa0 So Romney exceeded voters\' expectations because he did not insult them during the -- he has bad ideas, I mean, but given what they\'ve seen recently, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to sort of cross a minimum threshold.\xc2\xa0 So he did that.</p>\n<p>Does that mean that someone in Toledo, Ohio, who works at an auto parts supplier, who has decided to vote for the President, is now going to vote for Governor Romney?\xc2\xa0 My strong suspicion is no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to be tougher next time?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to see a different -- Ax talked about sort of a shift and looking at strategies.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be a little bit tougher next time?</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to get into our -- here\'s what I would say.\xc2\xa0 We obviously are going to have to adjust for the fact of Mitt Romney\'s dishonesty.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s something we have to basically make sure people understand.\xc2\xa0 When he basically, at the beginning of the debate, looked to the American people and lied to them about his tax cut plan, we\'re going to have to take that into account and make sure people understand that you just can\'t wipe that away.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the decision not to mention either Bain or 47 percent a deliberate one?\xc2\xa0 Or was it just a case where time ran out and he might well have raised it had there been another 10 minutes?</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I think that the 47 percent comment is a universally known thing by everyone.\xc2\xa0 It\'s bothered voters.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve probably seen we\'re advertising on it pretty aggressively.\xc2\xa0 Others have.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s a fully known thing that\'s baked into the cake.</p>\n<p>Sure, there might have been an exchange where that came up.\xc2\xa0 But our view, again, was to say where we want to take the country on the economy.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s first goal is -- and he did this in his first answer -- how are you going to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And he laid out the plan he\'s been talking about, and make sure people understand that Romney\'s recipe is much different.</p>\n<p>And listen, my suspicion is one of the reasons that Romney is being judged to have had such an aggressive performance was that he kind of willfully tried to shape where he\'s been.\xc2\xa0 And one of the roles of the news media in our society is to hold potential presidents accountable for what they say.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That was a remarkable thing last night.\xc2\xa0 It was a remarkable thing to see someone, 34 days from a presidential election, suggest that somehow his marquee idea was "never mind," as the President said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President call him on that then?</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 He did.\xc2\xa0 He said, that\'s your plan.\xc2\xa0 The middle class is going to bear the burden; our deficits are going to explode.</p>\n<p>So, again, my suspicion is that that tax cut plan has already cost him real problems in the battleground state.\xc2\xa0 As Jen said with the ad that she showed you, we\'re not going to stop making sure people understand this is what he would do as President.\xc2\xa0 Now you\'ve got an added component.\xc2\xa0 He\'s being dishonest about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does what you\'re saying play into what your ad strategy is going to be and your battleground travel?\xc2\xa0 Are there any shifts that we should expect on either of those fronts?</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\'t speak about our ad strategy.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we\'ve been making a consistent case.\xc2\xa0 So what we wanted to make sure is now -- people are voting now, so people who are voting now understand where the President wants to take the economy, that his view is we build the economy from the middle class out; Romney\'s is top down.\xc2\xa0 We think the President made that point last night consistently.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to do that tomorrow, the day after that.</p>\n<p>And as people are getting ready to vote later in the month and in November, we\'ve got to continue to make that.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re just trying to make a consistent case that we had a devastating recession; the middle class was harmed by that; Romney wants to return to the same policies, in many cases on steroids; and the country can\'t afford that.</p>\n<p>And, by the way, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t change any of that last night.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think he performed better than people thought because recent history would suggest that he might start off by insulting half the country.\xc2\xa0 I think his policies would have hurt all the country, but at least he didn\xe2\x80\x99t directly insult anybody last night.\xc2\xa0 And I guess by that low bar he succeeded.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said some weeks ago that one of Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s strengths as a debater was his willingness to lie with ease.\xc2\xa0 Was the President adequately prepared to call him out on that last night?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think if you look at the tax cut exchange, the President said, listen, your numbers just don\xe2\x80\x99t add up.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that -- listen, he did that in the primary.\xc2\xa0 I thought last night took it to a level we have not seen before.\xc2\xa0 I mean, think about it.\xc2\xa0 Can you remember a debate where the candidate 34 days before an election basically tried to dismiss their primary idea in the election?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable thing.</p>\n<p>So I think we were ready for it, and we are going to have to adjust going forward simply because it is clear that Romney will try and say anything to get a political advantage in the moment.\xc2\xa0 But again, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure people understand what he will do as President.\xc2\xa0 Those cuts in education, the vouchers for Medicare, the huge tax cuts for the wealthy paid for by the middle class while exploding the deficit -- this is what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you always planned to cut an ad -- I mean, that was a really fast turnaround on an ad from last night to this morning.\xc2\xa0 Or did you rush to sort of put it together given what happened?</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I mean, four years ago we did it after each debate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you were going to, but what you did would depend on what happened and --</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we thought it was important to let people know that someone who would lie to 50 million Americans, you should have some questions about whether that person should sit in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say you have to make some adjustments -- and Axelrod said the same thing this morning -- what does that mean exactly?\xc2\xa0 Does that mean more debate time prep?\xc2\xa0 What does it mean?</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 What I mean is we just need to account for Romney\xe2\x80\x99s dishonesty, which -- so that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make sure we -- people need to understand what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do as President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how does the President adjust so that he\xe2\x80\x99s able to do that in the next debate?</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be prepared and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready to make the case.\xc2\xa0 Now, this is a town hall debate, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll both be talking directly to average Americans about our different plans and our different visions and how those contrast.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did the President feel -- you talked to him last night and this morning.\xc2\xa0 How did he feel about his performance?\xc2\xa0 Was he surprised at the reviews, or did he also feel in his gut like, I wish I could have a do-over on that?</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 He thought he made a very compelling case about Romney\xe2\x80\x99s tax cut plan and their different approaches to the deficit, their different approaches to Medicare, different approaches to corporate -- ending corporate welfare.\xc2\xa0 So he felt he did a good job of doing that.\xc2\xa0 And again, our view is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s steadiness and consistency has always been an important attribute to the American people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons we got elected in 2008, and we think right now that steadiness was on display last night.</p>\n<p>You don\xe2\x80\x99t get different Barack Obamas or different plans based on the political necessity of the moment, and we think that\xe2\x80\x99s a strength.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did it go too far, the steadiness, his not being aggressive?\xc2\xa0 Was that an over-compensation perhaps?</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 Listen, I think -- no.\xc2\xa0 I think the President was very committed to making sure the American people understood where he wants to take the country, how that contrasts with Governor Romney.\xc2\xa0 Again, Governor Romney put on a theatrically aggressive and dishonest performance.\xc2\xa0 I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s being reviewed by some as being aggressive.\xc2\xa0 But I think when you step back -- and listen, I think in the days to come, you all, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to help you do it, are going to chew on the fact that Romney ran away from his central economic idea, okay?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re not suggesting that somehow he\xe2\x80\x99s changed his mind.\xc2\xa0 This is what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do as President.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to cut taxes in a huge way for the wealthy, because this is what he believes.\xc2\xa0 In the start of his debate -- go back and look at it, guys -- his very first answer:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a $5 trillion tax cut plan.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a $5 trillion tax cut plan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you regret your caution at all?\xc2\xa0 Some Democrats say you were kind of -- late innings, you were kind of squeezing the bat a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Were you playing a little too safe, David?\xc2\xa0 Come on.</p>\n<p>MR. PLOUFFE:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this before.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to run through the tape, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to run hard, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go out there and fight for every vote.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve always expected it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be close.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what this election is going to be -- it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a close race in a number of battleground states.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But again, as you guys evaluate the impact of this election, I would just humbly suggest you cast your gaze to places like Ohio and Iowa and New Hampshire, and see if the race structurally changes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:33 P.M.
