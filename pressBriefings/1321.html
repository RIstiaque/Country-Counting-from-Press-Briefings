VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Hey, guys, thanks for getting on.\xc2\xa0 I know the President is going to speak fairly soon, so we will keep this brief.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll also get you a transcript.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re here today to talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 Your speakers today are Dan Shapiro, who is our senior director for the Middle East and North Africa, and Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor for strategic communications.</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to turn it over to Ben.\xc2\xa0 He and Dan will quickly speak, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take some questions.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Hi, thanks, everybody for joining, heading into a holiday weekend here.\xc2\xa0 We knew there\xe2\x80\x99s a good amount of interest in the upcoming visit of Prime Minister Netanyahu, so we wanted to provide you with this brief overview of what the meeting will entail and what our expectations are.</p>\n<p>Let me just start by saying this will be the fifth meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama since Prime Minister Netanyahu took office last spring.\xc2\xa0 Three of those, of course, have been here in the White House.\xc2\xa0 One was up in New York at the U.N. General Assembly.</p>\n<p>In terms of what we have scheduled for the visit right now, the President will have the opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu in the Oval Office on Tuesday morning.\xc2\xa0 Following that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a press spray where the leaders will be able to make statements and take questions.\xc2\xa0 And following that, there will be expanded working lunch with the Israeli delegation.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d just say a few comments by way of introduction then turn it over to Dan.\xc2\xa0 This comes at a time of some momentum in a number of fronts.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the proximity talks, Dan can speak a little bit about the activity that\'s taken place since the proximity talks got started in the spring.\xc2\xa0 The President has hosted Abu Mazen and King Abdullah here in the White House, too, recently and had very good meetings with them and discussed our shared interests in advancing peace in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve also had substantial progress in terms of dealing with regional security, particularly the threat from Iran\xe2\x80\x99s failure to live up to its obligations with regard to its nuclear programs both through the U.N. Security Council resolution and a number of national measures that have been taken following the Security Council resolution, including by the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And finally, of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s been close cooperation with Israel as related to Gaza.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Dan speak to that, as well.\xc2\xa0 So with that I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Dan to set up some of the substantive matters of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>MR. SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 Hi, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for joining.\xc2\xa0 As Ben said, this is the fifth meeting between these two leaders in the last -- just a little over a year, which is appropriate.\xc2\xa0 This is a very close relationship, a special relationship, a strategic alliance with one of our closest partners in not just the Middle East but the entire world.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s quite fitting and quite expected I think that these two leaders would see each other regularly for very deep and detailed -- discussions on a whole range of issues that we work on together.</p>\n<p>We have shared interests.\xc2\xa0 We have shared values.\xc2\xa0 And we have a great deal of work that we do together with our Israeli partners.\xc2\xa0 So we look forward to the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s arrival.</p>\n<p>As Ben said, certainly a major focus of the discussion will be around the progress that\'s been made so far in the proximity talks and the opportunity to make the transition into direct talks.\xc2\xa0 Our special envoy, George Mitchell, has just returned from the region where he conducted the fifth round of proximity talks.</p>\n<p>These talks have been really quite substantive.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve engaged with both sides on all the core issues that are relevant to this conflict.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve always viewed the proximity talks as a mechanism to get to direct talks, which is where the real negotiations toward agreements and ultimately an agreement that will produce a two-state solution can be achieved.</p>\n<p>We feel that already in the little over a month that these talks have been going on, the gaps have narrowed.\xc2\xa0 And we believe there are opportunities to further narrow those gaps to allow the sides to take that next step to the direct talks.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged, and obviously, the President and the Prime Minister will talk about that subject.</p>\n<p>We always keep our focus on our broader Middle East peace goals -- a comprehensive Middle East peace that includes not only an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, but an Israeli-Syrian, and Israeli-Lebanese agreements and normalization and full peace between Israel and all its neighbors.\xc2\xa0 And so there will certainly be an opportunity to discuss those tracks, as well.</p>\n<p>As Ben mentioned, there has been a lot of very significant developments on the subject of Iran.\xc2\xa0 Iran is, of course, an issue that both we and Israel -- and of course, many of our other international partners have deep concerns about its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 And we share with Israel and with many other countries a determination to prevent Iran from acquiring those weapons.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the passage of Security Council Resolution 1929, the additional measures that many other countries have taken and the Iran Sanctions Legislation that the President signed yesterday are all very significant developments in demonstrating to Iran that there are significant costs for continuing on the path it\xe2\x80\x99s on and ultimately in our effort to change that path, and as I say, prevent the acquisition of nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 So there is much commonality of our focus and our effort on that with Israel.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m certain the Prime Minister and the President will discuss that issue, as well.</p>\n<p>Ben mentioned Gaza.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m certain that will be on the agenda, as well.\xc2\xa0 Just under two weeks ago, the Prime Minister announced a new policy on Gaza with a significant liberalization of the regime that governs the kinds of goods and the kinds of commercial activity that can go through the crossings between Israel and Gaza.</p>\n<p>The President welcomes those changes which we think will make -- are already beginning to and certainly as they\'re -- continue to be implemented will make a significant difference in the lives of people on the ground in Gaza.\xc2\xa0 We were joined in welcoming those steps by our Quartet partners.\xc2\xa0 And already we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, some significant work by the Israelis to implement the new policy.\xc2\xa0 More is coming in the days ahead.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President and the Prime Minister really look forward to reviewing that progress, as well as exploring what additional steps are possible to continue to address what has been an unsustainable situation in Gaza.</p>\n<p>And all of that must be done, and we place a high priority on doing that in a way that\'s fully consistent with Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security needs and preventing weapons from getting in the hands of Hamas, which, of course, has launched many terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens, as well as maintaining our focus on securing the release of Gilad Shalit from captivity.\xc2\xa0 So I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop there and let Tommy handle questions.</p>\n<p>MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Why don\'t you fire away and we\xe2\x80\x99ll ask a couple questions here?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I think it was yesterday or the day before, Mahmoud Abbas was quoted as saying that the Israelis were stalling in the proximity talks.\xc2\xa0 Can I just get your comment on that?\xc2\xa0 And given that, do you think there is a realistic time frame for moving into direct talks in the near future?\xc2\xa0 What kind of time frame would it be?</p>\n<p><br/>\n\tMR. SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I say, I think our view is that these talks which have always been understood as a mechanism to narrow gaps in order to get to direct talks actually have made progress, and the gaps have been narrowed.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to put a precise timeline on when that step could be taken, but we are encouraged by the progress that\'s been made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Of course, the President had a chance to review that progress himself with President Abbas just about two or three weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 And we heard useful, encouraging things in those meetings.\xc2\xa0 The two rounds since then that Senator Mitchell has conducted have further advanced the effort, so this is an important opportunity for the two leaders, the President and the Prime Minister to engage in some of the details that obviously Senator Mitchell has been dealing with on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0 And often those kinds of meetings help spur additional progress -- in this case toward narrowing gaps, toward getting to direct talks.\xc2\xa0 So I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put a precise timeline on it, but we feel things are moving in a positive direction, but there\xe2\x80\x99s still work to do.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99d just add, Steve, this is Ben, that the President believes that we have made a good deal of progress through the proximity talks in narrowing those gaps that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for all parties to seize an opportunity here to move forward.\xc2\xa0 And you know he underscored the importance of moving to direct talks in his meeting with Abu Mazen.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to continue to move in that direction with this visit from Prime Minister Netanyahu, as well.</p>\n<p>MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll take the next question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Is the 2004 letter from President Bush to Prime Minister Sharon still reflecting a U.S. understanding of the parameters or borders of final agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians?</p>\n<p>MR. SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 Eli, understand I don\'t think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a comment on these kinds of private discussions that we\xe2\x80\x99re having with the parties.\xc2\xa0 We have a very good understanding with our Israeli partners about the foundations of this relationship and this effort to move toward our shared goals of comprehensive peace and two states.\xc2\xa0 But on the specific question you\xe2\x80\x99ve raised, I don\'t have a comment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was a public letter.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We understand.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No comment.</p>\n<p>MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Okay, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take next question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 The settlement freeze in the West Bank is due to come up in September, and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty -- and it seems like there\xe2\x80\x99s already a lot of pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu not to sort of roll it over again unless there\xe2\x80\x99s direct talks, kind of starting quickly.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect the issue of the settlement freeze be a major part of the meeting next week?\xc2\xa0 And what is President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s position on the continued settlement freeze in the West Bank?\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>MR.\xc2\xa0 SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 Actually, the settlement freeze or moratorium that the Prime Minister announced last fall was really quite significant and we think has contributed to the progress we have made so far.</p>\n<p>I think our focus and the focus of this meeting is very much going to be on making that transition into direct talks and really on the substance of what\xe2\x80\x99s already been covered in the proximity talks.\xc2\xa0 So that I expect is what will be the main focus of their conversation.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d just add, David, that part of what has taken place over the last several months is to create the kind of conditions that can facilitate productive proximity talks to lead into those direct talks and to help facilitate an atmosphere of confidence and trust to address what are, of course, some very complicated issues.</p>\n<p>Related to that I think the President saw the moratorium as a very constructive step taken by Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli government.\xc2\xa0 And right now, as Dan said, what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is capitalizing on the momentum that\'s been built through the proximity talks to move -- to continue to move forward and to reach direct negotiations in pursuit of a comprehensive peace.</p>\n<p>MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll take the next question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hello.\xc2\xa0 I would like to know because many Israeli officials feeling there is a rift between the U.S. and the Obama -- between them and the Obama administration, do you feel from your hand that they feel the same situation, that there is a rift between the two administrations?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say a couple of words, and then Dan may want to add in.\xc2\xa0 I mean I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no rift between the United States and Israel.\xc2\xa0 This is a relationship, first of all, that is very strong and very important to the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one that\'s based on our shared interest and our shared values.\xc2\xa0 I think that our administration in partnership with the Israeli government has taken a number of steps to strengthen and deepen our cooperation.</p>\n<p>Just to focus, for instance, in the security side of things, the commitment of this administration to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s qualitative military edge has been -- through programs such as the Iron Dome, and through a very close contact through our national security teams is evidence of really a deepening of cooperation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that, for instance, Admiral Mullen was recently able to visit Israel on a trip to the region to further underscore the closeness of our consultations among our militaries and our national security teams.</p>\n<p>Here at the White House, I know that General Jones is in constant contact with Uzi Arad on a range of issues, and that that\'s emblematic of, again, the close contacts among many government officials.</p>\n<p>But I\xe2\x80\x99d say that as it relates to a whole range of issues, whether it is proximity talks, whether it is our shared view of the threat from Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, whether it is our shared efforts to -- in recent days at least, to see that the situation in Gaza improves, we actually have very close consultation and cooperation with the Israel government and it reflects a relationship that is in a very good place and that -- and that\'s, of course, fitting and appropriate given the deep and longstanding ties to the United States and Israel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, Dan, may want to add --</p>\n<p>MR. SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, I just agree with everything Ben said and can certainly state -- underscore the incredible richness and intensity and quality of the exchange between our governments in military channels, in political channels, in intelligence channels.\xc2\xa0 That kind of cooperation characterizes a spirit of partnership and strategic alliance that, as Ben said, is extremely important to the United States and our interests and, of course, our values.</p>\n<p>We view the Prime Minister as our partner in the effort to pursue peace with the Palestinians, peace -- comprehensive peace in the region, and deal with all of the security threats, many of which are threats that we both face -- the same threats.\xc2\xa0 So in no way do we perceive a rift, quite the contrary, we perceive -- and I believe our friends in Israel perceive a strong, close relationship -- a partnership.</p>\n<p>MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Great, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Why don\'t we take one more, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can wrap up before the President goes on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 I would like just to ask very quick two questions.\xc2\xa0 One regarding the meeting next week, do you think the President will call two parties -- Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas to come to Washington next month to start kind of direct peace talks?\xc2\xa0 I just want to know can you confirm that, first?</p>\n<p>Secondly, I would like to know, as you know the Arab, especially Egypt announced that in September, it will be the view for the Arab League if the settlement not ceased totally, they will go to the U.N. and they will acknowledge a Palestinian state.\xc2\xa0 I would like to know what\xe2\x80\x99s the position of the Obama administration on that?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Good, thanks, for the questions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say a couple of things and then turn it over to Dan.\xc2\xa0 On the first one, of course, as we said, we are very much looking to move to a direct negotiation between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\xc2\xa0 The proximity talks have been in service of that goal.\xc2\xa0 I think that as it relates to the venue and nature of those direct talks, we have not yet reached the point where we are discussing the kind of scenario that you put forward, for instance a meeting here in Washington.</p>\n<p>Again, our focus is to narrow the gaps -- to use these proximity talks, which are focused on the full range of substantive issues between Israelis and Palestinians, but to use those talk to narrow gaps and to create the best conditions possible to move toward direct negotiations.</p>\n<p>But again, we have not yet discussed with the parties what the particular venue for those talks would be, or the level of which they would commence, so it\xe2\x80\x99s premature to speculate as to the kind of meeting -- be it bilateral or trilateral, including that United States -- that you outlined.</p>\n<p>But, of course, it is our strong view that the parties should move to direct negotiations in the near future to address the issues that are being discussed through the proximity channels.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, and with regard to September, Dan can speak to this, we\xe2\x80\x99re, of course, fully aware of a number of events that are taking place in September, whether it is a meeting of the Arab League or the U.N. General Assembly or the -- as with that before on the call, the West Bank settlement moratorium, but again, our focus is on building what really has been some momentum in a number of areas -- be it Gaza, and the changes that are being implemented there, be it the proximity talks that we believe could create an opportunity here in the coming weeks and months to make some substantial progress over the course of the summer.</p>\n<p>And this meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama is yet another opportunity to do so, again, building on a very positive meeting with President Abbas when he was here in Washington.</p>\n<p>I should have just added too by the way when I was going through the schedule and introduction to the meeting that this is a meeting that was rescheduled from earlier in the month when Prime Minister Netanyahu had to go back to Israel on short notice from Canada.\xc2\xa0 But again, we do feel it comes at a very opportune time, building on positive discussions with President Abbas, with King Abdullah, with the proximity talks Senator Mitchell has led in the region.</p>\n<p>But I don\'t know Dan if you want to add to any of those two?</p>\n<p>MR. SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 No, I have nothing to add to that.</p>\n<p>MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Well, thanks, guys, have a great Fourth of July.\xc2\xa0 If you have follow-ups, let us know.\xc2\xa0 But we hope to talk to you on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 Bye.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:27 P.M.
