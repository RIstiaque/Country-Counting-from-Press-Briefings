EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming to the briefing today.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I have a quick announcement. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Thursday, September 22nd, the President will travel to Cincinnati, Ohio, to deliver remarks at the Brent-Spence Bridge, urging Congress to pass the American Jobs Act now, so that we can make much-needed investments in infrastructure projects across the country and put more Americans back to work.\xc2\xa0 The Brent-Spence Bridge is on one of the busiest trucking routes in North America, yet it is considered \xe2\x80\x9cfunctionally obsolete\xe2\x80\x9d because it is in need of so many significant repairs.\xc2\xa0 If Congress passes the American Jobs Act, we can put more Americans back to work, while getting repairs like this one done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details for you as they become available.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t arranged for it to collapse during the event, have you?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Certainly not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I have three topics, so I will go quickly; try to.\xc2\xa0 On foreign affairs, the Palestinians said today that they plan to press ahead with their bid for statehood at the Security Council, rebuffing efforts by the U.S. and others to prevent that, for reasons that you all laid out before.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House now conceding that that\xe2\x80\x99s the state of play?\xc2\xa0 Or is there a view that there\xe2\x80\x99s still some time to change minds?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ben, as you know, we have two envoys in the region, as we speak, who are engaged in concerted diplomacy to try to get both parties to -- down the road again, and together again, at least on the path towards direct negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Because the President firmly believes -- and, in fact, we believe it is self-evident -- that the only way to resolve the issues between the Palestinians and the Israelis and to ultimately create a Palestinian state is through direct negotiations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Palestinians will not, and cannot, achieve statehood through a declaration at the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 It is a distraction, and, in fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s counterproductive.\xc2\xa0 That remains our position.\xc2\xa0 We continue to be focused with great intensity on the need to get Israelis and Palestinians together again in direct negotiations, because that is the path towards a two-state solution and Palestinian statehood.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the economic front here, you guys have made clear that Social Security is not going to be part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations to the super committee.\xc2\xa0 Previously, as part of the default debate, the President had talked about being willing to make changes to Medicare, raising the eligibility in the future and also deeper means testing.\xc2\xa0 Are those now scrapped as well, or is it possible that they could be part of this package?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I want to make clear is the -- on Social Security, the President, from the beginning, has stated that we need to take measures to strengthen Social Security for the long term, but it is not a driver of our near-term deficit problems, and it can be pursued on a parallel track. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As to the other programs that are contributors to our deficit and debt issues, that are a focus of negotiations to find a substantial package of proposals that will deal with our deficit and long-term debt, the President discussed that in his speech last week to Congress, and he will be putting forward a series of proposals on Monday that will deal with a number of areas that are essential to be dealt with if we want to get our deficits and debt under control.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that include --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not waving us off --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY: -- negotiate a way -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to discuss the details of that proposal.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the President do that on Monday.\xc2\xa0 The point is -- the distinction here is that Social Security we have never seen as a driving factor in terms of our near-term deficit problems.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why it is separate from the other entitlement programs and other issues that are a part of that, including spending through our tax code.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I had one question for you on Solyndra.\xc2\xa0 I know you\'ve talked about how the White House is cooperating with investigations, and yesterday you took questions about it and said it was a matter of scheduling.\xc2\xa0 But I guess my question is perhaps bigger picture -- is the President at all chagrined or embarrassed by this?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is something of a mess here, regardless of the cooperation with the investigation.\xc2\xa0 What are his personal feelings about this story?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is absolutely committed to the idea that the United States must compete in the cutting-edge technologies of the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 We have a choice to make as a nation -- because we will be buying renewable energy products, whether it\'s wind, biofuel, solar, advanced battery technology -- we\'re going to be buying that stuff.\xc2\xa0 Do we want to buy it with a stamp on it that says, "Made in America," or are we going to buy it from the Chinese or from other countries?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have to be aggressive in competing in the global economy. And high-tech, clean-energy industries are going to be key to winning this century economically.\xc2\xa0 So he is absolutely committed to doing that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The necessity of doing that, the necessity of having the federal government involved in that, was seen even by the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 What we did is increase our commitment through the Recovery Act to that same goal, because it is just indisputable, if you look at what other nations are doing -- the nations that are likely to be most competitive economically in the 21st century -- even with the investments we\'re making and committed to make are, in the case of the Chinese, investing twice what we are in this.\xc2\xa0 So we will not cede those industries to our global competitors.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he agree that legitimate questions are being raised, or does he think this is politics? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s always an element of politics in these things.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t discussed with him this particular issue, but I know his commitment to clean-energy technologies, cutting-edge technologies, the need for the United States to compete, the fact that if we do, we will, as with the advanced battery industry, quickly move up and get a bigger and bigger share of the marketplace. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re on track to go from just a 2 percent slice of the advanced battery market to a 40 percent slice by 2015.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re on track to double our renewable energy production by 2012.\xc2\xa0 These are important achievements that will ensure that the United States is a global economic power -- a dominant global economic power in the 21st century.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with Social Security reform excluded from the package of recommendations the President will be making to the deficit panel next week, is it still possible in the administration\'s -- in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, to get to the $3 trillion or more savings?\xc2\xa0 Is that still a goal, the grand bargain?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The goal is to do substantial deficit reduction and debt control.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to throw out numbers about what that figure will look like because I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea to have everything my President -- this President wants to say on Monday out before he says it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I will leave it to the President on Monday to give you the details.\xc2\xa0 And he will do that with a broad array of proposals that he believes the Congress and the committee could use to substantially reduce our deficit and debt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you mentioned the two U.S. envoys who are in the Middle East now holding meetings, Hale and Ross.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of what, if any, progress has been made in these meetings they\xe2\x80\x99ve had with both sides, and are they looking at fallback options that would counter the Palestinians\xe2\x80\x99 intent on taking their statehood bid to the United Nations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be productive or helpful for me to give you a status update of diplomatic efforts that are ongoing, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do that.\xc2\xa0 I just can assure you that we are focused on, as we have been from the beginning, on the need for direct negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians because that\'s the only way for them to resolve the issues that remain unresolved and for them to reach a two-state solution.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President, Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Abbas will all be at the United Nations next week.\xc2\xa0 Is there any thought being given to a meeting -- either bilaterals with the President, even a three-way meeting -- either in New York or in Washington?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update on the schedule yet for the President\'s visit to the U.N. General Assembly next week.\xc2\xa0 We will do that for you tomorrow, so I don\'t have specifics in terms of the various meetings, bilaterals as well as group meetings he might have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say the only way the administration believes to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian situation is through direct negotiations and can\'t achieve statehood through the U.N.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain why the administration thinks Palestinians should back down from their position, given that negotiations seemed stalled?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because not only will they not achieve statehood through a declaration by the United Nations, the effort itself will be counterproductive to the goal, which is to return to direct negotiations between the two parties.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congressman Eliot Engel said that President Obama has a problem with Jewish voters in his Bronx, New York district.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think -- or why does the administration think there\'s a perception problem?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would disagree with that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know about the congressman\'s district itself.\xc2\xa0 I think as recently as last week or the week before, the Prime Minister of Israel made an incredibly strong statement about the remarkable commitment, unshakeable commitment, that this President has to Israel\'s security, and the unprecedented assistance that this President has provided Israel.\xc2\xa0 Both -- he has said this when I was with the Vice President in Israel and visiting with the Prime Minister, with regards to our overall -- this administration\'s overall efforts and commitment to Israeli security, and he said it again just in recent days with regard to President Obama\'s specific assistance to the Prime Minister of late.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this President\'s absolute commitment to Israel\'s security is, I think, demonstrated and unshakeable.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that he is committed to the process of trying to get the two parties to negotiate, get the two parties to go back to direct talks, because he believes it\'s in the interest of Israel and in the interests of the Palestinian people for them to reach peace in a way that ensures Israel\'s security and allows them to resolve their issues.\xc2\xa0 That, in the end, will ensure that the Jewish state of Israel survives and prospers.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration concerned that you\'ve let it get to this point, that we\'re on the cusp of UNGA and they may be facing a statehood vote?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve been talking about this off and on for weeks and months that -- if this problem were not complex and difficult it would have been solved a long time ago.\xc2\xa0 Many administrations have made significant efforts to deal with it. And we are completely focused on it, committed to it.\xc2\xa0 And we are convinced that the only way that Israelis and Palestinians can reach the goal that they share is through direct negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So we will keep on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The House subcommittee has looked into the Solyndra matter to a degree.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering, is it normal for the White House to show such interest in a Department of Energy loan? Is that a regular --1637<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure what -- you\'re referring to the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All the emails back and forth --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The emails, as have been amply demonstrated because we provided them as part of our cooperation, had to do with trying to schedule whether or not the Vice President was going to make an announcement.\xc2\xa0 And it was a scheduling issue.\xc2\xa0 That was the focus of the White House\'s interest in this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean -- okay, I understand that.\xc2\xa0 But it does seem like the White House --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you\'re asking me is the White House interested in the overall program and making investments --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, is it normal, is it standard operating procedure for the White House to get so involved in a loan that the Department of Energy is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have to correct you because there\'s no evidence that the White House was involved in the loan.\xc2\xa0 This was the White House involved -- because they weren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 The White House was involved in trying to find out when a decision would be made so they could make -- staff here could make a decision about the Vice President having an event. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, yes, as you know, and anybody who travels with us or understands the sort of complexity of scheduling White House events involving the two principals, the President and the Vice President, that process engages a lot of people and there\'s just a whole series of decisions that have to be made regarding scheduling, whatever the nature of the event.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a few days before the loan was approved, the chief investor, George Kaiser met with Rouse, Jarrett, and Goolsby. The White House has said that they think that meeting was largely about some of his charitable work.\xc2\xa0 Have you determined what entirely the meeting was about and whether or not the loan was brought up or discussed?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would point you simply to what George Kaiser himself has said, that he did not lobby or discuss -- he did not lobby administration officials with regard to this, with Solyndra.\xc2\xa0 He was involved in a lot of charitable efforts and it\'s our understanding that, while we haven\'t looked into every meeting that he might have had here, that that was the focus of his conversations, generally speaking, at the White House.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you reject the suggestion that the emails seem to imply that the visit by the Vice President -- which I guess ultimately was a satellite visit and not an in-person visit -- but that that played a role in whether or not the loan was approved?\xc2\xa0 You have an OMB official saying that the announcement should be postponed -- "this is the first loan guarantee; we should have four of you with all hands on deck to make sure we get it right" -- but the announcement was not postponed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, if you look at the emails, the issue that involved the Vice President having this event did not drive the loan process.\xc2\xa0 The loan was made -- the loan guarantee was made on a merit-based -- as a result of a merit-based process by career professionals over at the DOE.\xc2\xa0 The same process has been used, has been in place for all of these investments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it did not -- it did not play a role?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then, lastly, on the jobs plan, the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office says there has not been any outreach to them, even though -- from the White House on the jobs bill, even though last week they requested a meeting.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?\xc2\xa0 And, if so, why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t there been?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the President spoke a week ago.\xc2\xa0 There will be ample time going forward for continued consultations with leadership and rank-and-file members of Congress as Congress takes up the American Jobs Act and hopefully passes it, so that we can do the things we need to do to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said \xe2\x80\x9cpass this bill now\xe2\x80\x9d more than a hundred times in the last week --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s because it\xe2\x80\x99s so urgent.\xc2\xa0 He is reflecting --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not urgent enough to call the Speaker, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is reflecting the urgency that the American people feel.\xc2\xa0 And there will be, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, conversations between the White House and the leadership about this as we progress.\xc2\xa0 But what we have -- what you know about how Congress works and how Washington works is you need to keep people focused on the task at hand -- because there\xe2\x80\x99s so many other issues that can distract attention from the main, which, in this case, are the things we need to do to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President will be, and members of his staff will be engaged very directly with Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate as this process moves forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think he should call the Speaker before he reaches, say, 200?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were working for the Speaker on his scheduling.\xc2\xa0 The fact is -- he will talk to the Speaker, but it is -- the President has put forward a detailed piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 The elements of that plan are very clear.\xc2\xa0 The Congress can and should act on it very quickly.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not complicated.\xc2\xa0 The proposals are very simple.\xc2\xa0 And they reflect -- they are the kinds of proposals that have gained bipartisan support in the past.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand -- this is your thing now that when a reporter asks a question you impugn whether or not they have a political motive.\xc2\xa0 But if the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no, no.\xc2\xa0 And I apologize.\xc2\xa0 I simply meant --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President goes out there -- the President goes out there and says 100 times, \xe2\x80\x9cPass this bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking has he called the man in charge of passing the bill in the House?\xc2\xa0 It seems like a reasonable question --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and not one that is Republican-motivated.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, the President spoke with the Speaker on the day that he delivered his speech.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they will be speaking many times in the coming weeks and months about this and many other issues.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want it passed in weeks and months.\xc2\xa0 He wants it passed now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He does.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t called the Speaker.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need a phone call from the President to vote on legislation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a myth.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you know that this is -- going back to these questions, the insistence about why isn\xe2\x80\x99t he meeting with the Speaker beforehand, when I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t noticed anybody asking Republican leaders why they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t invited administration officials or the President in to negotiate the details of the Ryan budget, or to negotiate any of the Republican proposals that they\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We put forward our plan.\xc2\xa0 It should be debated, and, we hope, voted on in the House and the Senate, and turned into law. Because that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people want.\xc2\xa0 They want Congress to take action.\xc2\xa0 And we welcome -- as the Speaker has said about considering the ideas the President has put forward in the American Jobs Act -- we welcome other ideas, other proposals.\xc2\xa0 We will certainly -- we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for the answers that will get the economy growing and creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 And we welcome Republican ideas; we welcome Democratic ideas.\xc2\xa0 The President has put his ideas forward.\xc2\xa0 They happen to be ideas that have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support, and we hope and expect Congress will act on them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Norah.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President says the jobs plan should be passed immediately.\xc2\xa0 Does he have a sense that the Democrats in the Senate agree with him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has a sense -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s amply demonstrated by all the statements of support that have come out since the President spoke -- that Democrats broadly support the American Jobs Act, yes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And why are Gene Sperling and David Plouffe briefing the Democratic caucus today?\xc2\xa0 Was that something previously scheduled, or has it been in response to some of the criticism that the White House has received from Democratic senators?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Members of the White House go up and brief senators and members of Congress, members of the House, all the time on our initiatives -- going to the exchange I just had with Jake.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s part of communicating with Congress about what action we hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll take, and why our priorities are what they are.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a normal part of the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason I asked about whether the Democrats agree, I mean, you know Leader Reid has some other more immediate and pressing items that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to bring up.\xc2\xa0 Senator Casey today --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear about the fact that on transportation and FEMA, these are issues that have to be resolved within a matter of days so there\xe2\x80\x99s not an expiration of funding.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s completely understandable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you specifically address Senator Casey\xe2\x80\x99s criticism that people are skeptical of big pieces of legislation, so that his preference would be to break this up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know about people being skeptical of big pieces of legislation.\xc2\xa0 We have enormous regard for Senator Casey and if -- that may be the case.\xc2\xa0 As I was just saying to Jake, the elements of this American Jobs Act are very clear.\xc2\xa0 This is not a complex piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re pretty simple:\xc2\xa0 Cut the payroll tax in half for all Americans who receive a paycheck.\xc2\xa0 Cut it in half for small businesses, the employers\' side, for those businesses up to -- 98 percent of all businesses up to $5 million in payroll.\xc2\xa0 Provide money to states that will allow them to rehire teachers.\xc2\xa0 Launch initiatives that will speed up infrastructure projects, get construction workers back to work.\xc2\xa0 An initiative to incentivize businesses to hire veterans -- so many of our returning heroes from Iraq and Afghanistan who fought bravely for this country who shouldn\'t have to be fighting to get a job.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These are all -- this is pretty straightforward stuff.\xc2\xa0 So we think it could be acted on in its entirety, and that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what we would like to see happen.\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said -- and let me make clear, because Congress gets to legislate, if they sent us one part of that -- funding for teachers, for example -- the President obviously would not veto that.\xc2\xa0 He would sign it, and then he would say, okay, send me the rest.\xc2\xa0 And that would be true if it came in two pieces or four pieces, or one -- if he got it all at once, then that would be.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s our approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Final question.\xc2\xa0 You announced at the top of the briefing about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip next Thursday -- this bridge that is in Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s backyard.\xc2\xa0 It also happens to go into Kentucky, the home state of the Republican leader in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 I assume it was intentional to choose a bridge in the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s district -- yes?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a bridge that\xe2\x80\x99s in great need of repair.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a bridge that\xe2\x80\x99s relatively easy to get to from Washington.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a bridge that goes between --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why that bridge?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I think the President made a reference to it before --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And why the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s district?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good way to highlight the urgent need.\xc2\xa0 When you have a bridge that\xe2\x80\x99s described as "functionally obsolete," it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that this bridge could benefit from a little repair and renovation.\xc2\xa0 So I think that bridge because I think it helps highlight the urgent need in this country for us to improve our infrastructure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the Speaker thank you for helping to fix this bridge?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t helped him fix it yet.\xc2\xa0 We hope that he, together with us, will take action to help us fix it, to help the construction workers go and fix it.\xc2\xa0 And this is just -- we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to highlight an urgent need here, and we certainly think this is a good way to do it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President yesterday focused on -- in North Carolina, focused on the provisions within the American Jobs Act that help small businesses grow and hire.\xc2\xa0 He went -- before that, he focused on the assistance the American Jobs Act gives to renovate schools, repair schools, modernize schools, hire back teachers.\xc2\xa0 Now we want to draw some attention to the element of the American Jobs Act that focuses on the need to repair our infrastructure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Solyndra bankruptcy and loan guarantee really dominated the Senate hearing today, involving three Department of Energy nominees who probably won\xe2\x80\x99t even be confirmed before 15 other loans have to be acted on by the end of the month.\xc2\xa0 Is there any urgency, A, to review or to get those loans passed?\xc2\xa0 Senator Murkowski says the bankruptcy calls into question past and future loan guarantees.\xc2\xa0 Are you relooking at those loans, or is there an urgency to get them done before the spending --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is a merit-based process by which these applications for loan guarantees are reviewed and either rejected or approved, or sent back for further -- requesting further information.\xc2\xa0 That process is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And as I said, the President remains absolutely committed to the program and to the idea that we cannot cede these industries to our competitors globally.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not an option -- as I see it, and as the President sees it, most importantly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you looking at the process itself?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the process -- again, the process itself is merit-based, done by career employees at the Department of Energy, and that process continues.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a -- my understanding is it\xe2\x80\x99s a rigorous process, and has been and will be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the Solyndra bankruptcy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t raise questions about the process to you -- it\xe2\x80\x99s just Solyndra went belly up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I would refer you to the Department of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bad luck?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Department of Energy about the specifics of the process that -- of the review that leads to these loan guarantees being issued. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would make clear, in terms of your last question, that the reason why fledgling, cutting-edge industries need this kind of assistance is because they can be high risk as well as high reward.\xc2\xa0 We never thought, and the Department of Energy never thought, that every investment would succeed.\xc2\xa0 But that is not a reason to simply throw up your hands and say, never mind, let\xe2\x80\x99s let the Chinese own this industry, this field -- or the Indians, or the Europeans -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ll just buy their products.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the way this administration, this President, views our economic needs for the 21st century.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the process needs to be rigorous.\xc2\xa0 It needs to be merit-based.\xc2\xa0 It will continue to be.\xc2\xa0 The need to focus our energy and our -- the need to focus on these clean-energy technologies, these cutting-edge technologies remains as strong today as it was when the President took office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Murkowski questions whether the government should be more focused on clean energy or cheap energy.\xc2\xa0 Which would you say?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, as you know, the President\xe2\x80\x99s energy strategy is broad and inclusive.\xc2\xa0 It includes taking measures to ensure that we can produce more oil and gas here at home.\xc2\xa0 It includes nuclear energy.\xc2\xa0 It includes renewables, biofuels, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 It is an all-inclusive approach to growing our capacity to produce our own energy so that we do not rely on other countries for our energy security. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the right approach.\xc2\xa0 And his interest is in securing our energy future and doing it in a way that leads to industries being created and industries growing here in the United States, industries that hire people here in the United States and that have the benefit of improving our energy security.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did anybody at the White House, or the President call Speaker Boehner to let him know that you guys are going to be paying a friendly visit to his neighborhood next week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.*<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is sort of -- it\'s going to be interpreted -- to follow on what was the earlier question -- as sort of a push-back, chin-music --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a mystery, Mike, that we are out there, loudly and with great intensity, arguing that we in Washington need to do the bidding of the American people and take action on the economy.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s traveling, as he promised\xc2\xa0 -- the President did in his speech to Congress -- across the country to highlight this urgent need, and to engage the American people in calling on their members of Congress, their senators, to pass the bill -- to take action to grow the economy, to take action to incentivize the private sector to hire more workers.\xc2\xa0 This is the number-one priority of the American people, and it also happens to be the number-one priority of this President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me if, by going to this bridge, are we hoping to draw some attention to this urgent need, the answer is, unequivocally, yes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Politics -- we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen you on camera since the New York 9 race.\xc2\xa0 The economy, obviously, isn\xe2\x80\x99t very good.\xc2\xa0 That does not portend well for the President\xe2\x80\x99s own political prospects.\xc2\xa0 The man who had coined the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the economy, stupid,\xe2\x80\x9d for Democrats, the architect of a winning presidential campaign, says that the President should fire a lot of people now -- he had a number of other recommendations.\xc2\xa0 Norah already referred to Senator Casey.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also Senator Landrieu, Senator Manchin raising questions about the President\xe2\x80\x99s legislative strategy on jobs.\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned at all about his political prospects at this point?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President is focused on the things he needs to do as President, which, primarily -- as the top priority, is getting our economy going and creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 The dual priority obviously is the security of the American people and Americans abroad, and our interests. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President firmly believes that the American people know that he is doing everything he can to grow the economy, doing everything he can to work with Congress to create jobs, and he will continue at that.\xc2\xa0 He is a long way away from having -- from an election that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take place for another 14 months.\xc2\xa0 So his focus is not on his political standing or his standing in the polls.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s on the need to get Congress to focus, get Washington to focus, and take action on the economy and jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because, as you point out, the American people are upset about the state of the economy and the state of unemployment, as they should be -- 9.1 percent is too high.\xc2\xa0 They are also very upset at their accurate perception that this summer Washington not only didn\xe2\x80\x99t help, but hurt the economy, through the brinkmanship that we saw over the debt ceiling crisis.\xc2\xa0 There is an absolute, measurable impact on confidence that that circus had on the economy -- on business confidence and consumer confidence. And that is a very unfortunate thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Americans -- the vast majority of the American people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t political partisans on the far side of the spectrum, on either side, simply want their elected leaders to come together and take action for them.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t care who wins the political games.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t care who has the best line on a cable TV show. They just want their elected members of Congress, their President, to work together to get the economy going.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the U.N. General Assembly next week, would it be preferable for the Palestinians to bring their request to the General Assembly versus to the Security Council, as far as the U.S. is concerned?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the Palestinians are going to do, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to express a preference beyond the thing we\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear, which we do not believe it is constructive or productive for the Palestinians to pursue a declaration of statehood through the United Nations because it will not achieve their goal for them.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it is counterproductive, because -- this President has a very clear principle that both parties need to take steps that bring them closer to negotiations and closer to resolution.\xc2\xa0 And he supports each party when they take those steps.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both parties need to refrain from taking steps and doing things -- pursuing things that bring -- move them further apart. And we believe that this is not constructive or productive.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going to the General Assembly is not exactly a declaration of statehood in the same way as going to the Security Council is.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was referring to, obviously, the suggestion that they could pursue a declaration of statehood through the Security Council.\xc2\xa0 Again, what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge other things they might do.\xc2\xa0 We would certainly -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, we certainly think they should not pursue a declaration of statehood.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the comments that you just made were all in reference to going to the Security Council for a declaration of statehood -- were not meant to apply to some other action through the General Assembly?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When I referred to declarations of statehood, that\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 Broadly speaking, in a variety of arenas far from New York -- in fact, in the region -- whatever steps -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about this on both sides.\xc2\xa0 We want the -- we want each country to take steps toward resolving their differences, toward a lasting and enduring peace that allows for the creation of a Palestinian state and a secure and Jewish state of Israel.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re for those steps that bring them together; we\xe2\x80\x99re against those steps that move them further apart.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would going to the General Assembly be a step that pulls them further apart?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into speculating about what they may or may not do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment on that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking what they may or may not do.\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment on that option at all, really, right now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because it\xe2\x80\x99s pure speculation.\xc2\xa0 Right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, so is going to the Security Council is pure speculation, you could say, because they haven\xe2\x80\x99t done that either.\xc2\xa0 But you made some very strong comments --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what -- again -- speculate about what an alternative involving the General Assembly, what that would be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- observer status?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Going to the U.N. Security -- U.N. Security Council resolution to declare a state is pretty clear, and we\xe2\x80\x99re opposed to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you also oppose observer status?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not getting into the details because we don\xe2\x80\x99t even know -- the Palestinians have made clear that they might do this at the Security Council.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into details about what they may or may not do outside of that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have one other question on this topic, and that is -- so the President -- slightly different way of looking at this -- the President has taken, arguably, some pretty tough political risks on his own to try to be tough on Israel, to try to move this process forward in a way that you could argue should be helpful to the Palestinians. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any -- I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about not related to this U.N. situation, but over the last two and half years.\xc2\xa0 Is there any sense that the Palestinians are sort of not showing much appreciation for the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to condemn the settlements and to be tough on a close ally like Israel by essentially going -- potentially going in the face of the United States to take this action?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we think that, again, each side needs to take constructive steps towards direct negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Actions that make that harder are not helpful.\xc2\xa0 Actions that make it easier we support.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been true -- the principle this President has applied since he took office and focused very early on, a lot of effort and attention to this problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of the Israeli people and the Palestinian people that they -- that a peace is reached, that allows for a secure Jewish state of Israel and a Palestinian state that can exercise true self-determination.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in not just in the interests of those people; it\xe2\x80\x99s in the region\xe2\x80\x99s interest, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I was trying to say is, is the United States annoyed that the Palestinians are potentially doing this, given what the President has done for them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not -- this is not about feelings.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about taking whatever actions we can, diplomatically, to help the process move forward, to help bring the Israelis and Palestinians to the negotiating table, into direct negotiations that will ultimately lead to a resolution that meets the objectives of both sides.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just want to clarify -- are you saying that the White House is satisfied with Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s timetable for bringing up a jobs bill when he says they might get to it next work period?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly hope and expect that Congress will act as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 We want this bill passed now.\xc2\xa0 And by "now" we mean as soon as Congress can take it up and pass it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In response to Norah\xe2\x80\x99s question, I simply am stating what is I think obvious to all of you, which is that there are some things that Congress needs to move very quickly on before expiration dates are reached in terms of the surface transportation bill and FEMA and other things.\xc2\xa0 So we understand that.\xc2\xa0 But we obviously are urging Congress to move quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, in response to Norah, were you saying that it is accurate for us to say that the selection of the Brent-Spence Bridge is not a coincidence?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a coincidence in that it\xe2\x80\x99s a bridge that is one we can get to and highlight from the White House on a day trip that absolutely illustrates the problem we have with infrastructure in this country -- roads, bridges, and other forms of infrastructure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Once the President unveils his recommendations to the super committee, to what extent will he be involved publicly in trying to push those specific measures?\xc2\xa0 Will he be talking about it at events where he\xe2\x80\x99s also pushing the jobs bill?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a scheduling question that I don\'t have an answer to for you, if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about in the weeks and months beyond Monday.\xc2\xa0 He will continue to talk about it because it is part of his overall economic vision here, which he believes requires Washington to take action to address our short-term economic challenges, and that is represented by the American Jobs Act, and it also requires us to take action to address our medium- and long-term deficit and debt problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as he talks about the American Jobs Act, he talks about specifics there.\xc2\xa0 When he\xe2\x80\x99s -- once he unveils the super committee recommendations, will he talk about the specifics as he\xe2\x80\x99s out there also talking about the specifics of the American Jobs Act?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he will talk about it within the context of the need to get our economy going.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that getting our deficits and debt under control are part of that, about a part of getting our foundation strong for future growth and future job creation.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that our urgent task right now is to take measures that -- including tax cuts and tax incentives, as well as infrastructure investment and putting teachers back to work -- that get the economy growing and people back to work in the near term.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So both -- these are component parts of a broader economic vision.\xc2\xa0 They happen to reflect the testimony of the director of the Congressional Budget Office.\xc2\xa0 The other day when he was asked, what\xe2\x80\x99s the right recipe for economic policy right now, what do we need to do -- short term investments, tax cuts and spending to get our economy growing, to get people back to work; medium- and long-term efforts to get our deficits and debt under control.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just -- I want to see if you can react to something that Speaker Boehner said in his speech today.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cTax increases I think are off the table, and I don\'t think they\xe2\x80\x99re a viable option for the joint committee.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we will see what the joint committee does.\xc2\xa0 The public overwhelmingly -- overwhelmingly -- agrees with the President that to get our long-term fiscal house in order we need to approach it in a balanced way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the answer is the Ryan budget, we know what the -- how Americans feel about that.\xc2\xa0 They do not believe that we need to end Medicare as we know it to get our deficits and debt under control -- because we don\'t.\xc2\xa0 We think that -- I mean, these are about choices.\xc2\xa0 These are about choices.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have unlimited resources.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re a great and powerful country with enormous resources, but they are not unlimited.\xc2\xa0 And you have to make choices about do we provide tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, who over the past 10 to 12 years have done far better than any other segment in society, or do we make sure that responsibility for solving this problem is shared and that we have a balanced approach?\xc2\xa0 The President feels that we have to take a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 The American public feels the same way. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would simply note that the Speaker of the House made clear that in the negotiations he had with the President, he put, in his words, \xe2\x80\x9crevenues on the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We believe revenues have to be on the table if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to solve our deficit and debt problems.\xc2\xa0 We believe it; scores of prominent Republicans believe it; the members of the Gang of Six, the members of the Simpson-Bowles commission, Domenici-Rivlin commission.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is not -- again, these are not all that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s just not that hard, because there aren\xe2\x80\x99t that many options.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t pull new stuff out of the sky.\xc2\xa0 We know what the problems are in terms of our deficits and debt, and we know what the answers are. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that -- when the President proposed his job bill he did something new -- not necessarily unprecedented, but pretty unusual, which is he laid out the specific detailed piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, when he sends up his recommendations, how specific is he going to be about entitlements, for instance?\xc2\xa0 Or is he going to lay out broad principles?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will simply cite the President\xe2\x80\x99s words back to you, which is he said he would put out detailed proposals.\xc2\xa0 So he will.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that means specifics on entitlements as well as tax reform?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The whole thing will be specific proposals, to quote the President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 David.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the President going to Ohio again for his jobs bill, is it just also a coincidence that the first -- the four trips that he\xe2\x80\x99s making outside the city on behalf of the jobs bill happen to be the swing states that he won in 2008 but that George Bush had won in 2004?\xc2\xa0 Or is that intentionally considered --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can assure you -- first of all, this bridge spans Ohio and Kentucky, so if we were flying into Kentucky and driving to it from the other side, would that render your question moot?\xc2\xa0 Because the bridge is where it is, okay?\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s -- although we certainly hope to win Kentucky in 2012, but we concede that it\xe2\x80\x99s a steep climb.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The point is he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on the problem.\xc2\xa0 And you know as well as I do that presidential travel is -- a lot of logistics involved in it, and we go places that are reasonably easy to reach, that can accept the presidential aircraft and all the things that come along with presidential travel.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously are interested in focusing people\xe2\x80\x99s attention on the urgent need to take action to grow the economy and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President favor cutting aid to the Palestinian state, especially if there is a declared Palestinian state?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s a speculation about what may or may not happen, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a tally on how much aid this administration has given to the Palestinians?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure somebody does.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it on the top of my -- in my book here or tip of my tongue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Iranian situation, can the U.S. forbid the Iranian President from coming to the U.S. if those two hostages are not released?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard any discussion of that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously focused on the need to get those hikers released and home.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any update on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of quick things.\xc2\xa0 Republicans on the Hill are very interested in regulations and reducing the regulatory burden.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the Speaker has talked about that.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously has done his look-back.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s interested in putting a hold on the smog rule.\xc2\xa0 What does the President believe is wrong-headed about the conservatives\xe2\x80\x99 concept of having Congress review the most expensive rules?\xc2\xa0 Are they heading in the wrong direction?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the concept -- whoever -- putting aside who reviews them, because I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that specifically -- the concept of reviewing rules and deciding whether they\xe2\x80\x99re obsolete rules or ones that unnecessarily hamper business growth and job creation I think is one the President agrees with, as demonstrated by his own look-back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would note that the cost of the regulations in the first two years of this administration are less than the cost of the regulations in the last two years of the Bush administration.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly -- going back to the broader picture here -- the President shares that goal.\xc2\xa0 As long as we ensure that we are not compromising the safety of the American people, or safety of our children, the air that we breathe, the water that we drink, we need to be wise and prudent about regulation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as the Speaker has said about the President\xe2\x80\x99s jobs plan, we look forward to examining and considering the ideas that the Speaker puts forward, or that any other members of Congress put forward.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that it\xe2\x80\x99s important when we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the task at hand, which is growing the economy and creating jobs, that the same standard be applied. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We made clear that we felt the proposals we would put forward would be judged by independent analysts and economists to, if passed, have a quick, positive impact on the economy and job creation.\xc2\xa0 Those same economists -- the independent economists should be asked to judge others\' proposals and to see what impact they may have on the near term.\xc2\xa0 Because we have a near-term need.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very interested, too, in taking measures that solidify the foundation of this country\xe2\x80\x99s economy for the years going out.\xc2\xa0 And this President is committed to the measures that he has already put in place and will announce on Monday to building that foundation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we also have a task now, which is to get this economy growing at a faster pace, get it producing jobs at a faster pace. So we hope that whatever proposals or ideas that others have are looked at through that lens, because that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people are asking us to do -- justifiably.\xc2\xa0 They are not -- they are interested in, of course, measures that will help us in the long term, and we are very interested in -- the President is very interested in that.\xc2\xa0 But he also has made clear that we have a short-term need that we need to address.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a quick clarification.\xc2\xa0 On Social Security, if the President, on Monday, is not going to speak to that directly, that shouldn\'t be interpreted that he won\xe2\x80\x99t weigh in later on, as the super committee gets further ahead in its work, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Speaking to Social Security?\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s making an assumption that the super committee will address Social Security.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we will obviously have something to say about whatever approach the super committee takes and product that it puts forward.\xc2\xa0 And the President will, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, speak to that, as will others.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you suggesting that you\xe2\x80\x99re anticipating the super committee won\xe2\x80\x99t go near Social Security?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not presupposing anything about what the super committee will do.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m simply saying that you\xe2\x80\x99re assuming that it will, and if they -- whatever product they come up with, we will be, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, engaged and commenting on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So, on Monday, the President will obviously put forward his ideas, but in what format?\xc2\xa0 A speech here? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have an announcement on that, I\'m sure, before the end of the week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Christi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, it\xe2\x80\x99s been more than two years now since the President gave his speech in Cairo, and I wonder how you analyze the change, if there is a change, in the U.S. relationship with Muslims around the world.\xc2\xa0 Is it better?\xc2\xa0 Is it worse?\xc2\xa0 Can you tell?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to claim myself as an expert on this.\xc2\xa0 What I know -- because I know there\'s polling data and other things by which you can judge this -- what I do know is that, broadly speaking, around the globe, this President, when he took office, engaged in a process by which he sought to -- and we believe has succeeded in -- strengthening America\xe2\x80\x99s position around the world by improving its relations around the world.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not specific to one region, necessarily, or one people, but globally.\xc2\xa0 And it includes our allies, as well as others around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We think that our ability to affect change in a positive way, globally, is enhanced when we have strengthened our ties with our allies, strengthened our ties around the globe, and increased our influence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re saying -- wait a minute, so wait, was that yes?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t have a measure for it.\xc2\xa0 We believe that to be the case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That relations with U.S. allies is stronger?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the approach the President has taken has strengthened our position, has enhanced our stature, and increased our ability to act collectively, around the world, in ways that protect and enhance U.S. interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And, so, specifically to -- since the President did -- I mean, there was a big spotlight on this speech and the intent of it was clear -- it was mostly directed to Muslims around the world, as he said.\xc2\xa0 What do you think is the likely effect of casting a veto at the national -- at the Security Council?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have made clear our position on that.\xc2\xa0 And we have taken the position we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken because we do not believe it is ultimately in the interest of Middle East peace -- of the process.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t bring the two sides closer together.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t bring the -- it would not bring the Palestinians any closer to statehood.\xc2\xa0 And we believe it would be counterproductive to that goal.\xc2\xa0 So our approach is one that we think is in the interests of helping the Palestinians reach their ultimate goal, and the only way they\xe2\x80\x99re going to reach that goal is through direct negotiations with the Israelis.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick question about Solyndra.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed about what has developed on that?\xc2\xa0 Just has he been briefed at all about the questions being raised, or just what his administration --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s probably read some news accounts of it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that he\xe2\x80\x99s been briefed.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what happened here is an investment did not pan out.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of reasons for that that have to do with the international marketplace and the price -- the cost of solar panels, and the Chinese pricing of their competitive products. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And beyond that, it\xe2\x80\x99s a story that has to do with an inquiry by the Hill.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot to brief him on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\'ll take one more.\xc2\xa0 And then, Chris, I\'ll take you, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following on Christi\'s question on threatening the veto.\xc2\xa0 The Palestinians have accused the United States of appealing to Israeli interests abroad and here in pursuing the veto -- or threatening the veto.\xc2\xa0 Are you worried at all about losing the U.S. standing in the region, or as an honest broker in the region?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This President, this administration, is focused on the long-term goal here.\xc2\xa0 The reason why we oppose an effort to have statehood declared by the U.N. is because it\xe2\x80\x99s counterproductive and it won\xe2\x80\x99t bring them any close to statehood. We believe that the Palestinians and the Israelis need to reach an agreement through direct negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So it is in support of those aspirations that we have taken the stand that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- Sam and Chris.\xc2\xa0 Chris and Sam.\xc2\xa0 Chris.\xc2\xa0 And then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go, because Ben has told me I need to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back in 2008, during the debate over Proposition 8 in California, both sides of the debate utilized various elements of what they saw as the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on marriage equality in their campaign literature.\xc2\xa0 North Carolina decided earlier this week that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be having a marriage amendment on the ballot in May 2012.\xc2\xa0 When asked for a comment on it, the White House only talked about the fact that the President has long opposed similar measures in the past.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a position on the North Carolina amendment specifically?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to disappoint you here because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take this question -- but I think our position on similar amendments has been clear.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific one on this, but I think you can -- our position is clear on this, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is clear on this.\xc2\xa0 But I can take your question for greater clarification.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a follow-up, does the President have any plans to, in any way, memorialize the end of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d on September 20th?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a scheduling update for you on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam, and then I\'ve got to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another state policy-related question.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, a lot of news reports about Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s plans to divvy up the electoral college votes from the state.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President is running for reelection; this could affect his path forward.\xc2\xa0 What does the White House think of this proposal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you get --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can get back to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer on that one, can I ask a different question, then, which is that -- (laughter) -- Senator John --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to someone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Senator John -- (laughter) -- Senator John Kerry has decided to forego fundraising during his time on the super committee.\xc2\xa0 Others have not made that choice, obviously.\xc2\xa0 This White House has always, in the past, applauded sort of transparency and lack of conflict of interest.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if they would appreciate other members of the committee to make that same pledge.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I certainly commend Senator Kerry on his stand, but I think the issue here is the members of that committee are obligated to fulfill the mandate that Congress gave them.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly believe that they will only be able to do that if they take an approach that is essential to reaching the kind of resolution that will get support in Congress and become law, which is an open-minded approach, an inclusive, balanced approach, that acknowledges that we need to -- the only we can get our fiscal house in order is if we ensure that the responsibility for that and the burden for that is fairly shared across the spectrum.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t think fundraising might complicate that goal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that members of Congress need to focus on the tasks that they were, in this case, appointed to perform.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 2:00 P.M.
