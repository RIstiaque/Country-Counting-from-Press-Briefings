Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t10:31 A.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming to this gaggle.\xc2\xa0 I\'m pleased to be joined today by Neal Wolin, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, to discuss the need to get Richard Cordray, our nominee to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, confirmed so the bureau can exercise its full ability to protect consumers.\xc2\xa0 As you all know, the Senate will vote today\xc2\xa0 -- or rather tomorrow -- on Cordray\'s nomination.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore we start, I wanted to run through a few things that we are doing today to continue to make the case to the American people on the need to get Cordray confirmed.\xc2\xa0 This afternoon, a bipartisan group of attorneys general from across the country will renew their call for the Senate to confirm Cordray.\xc2\xa0 Earlier this fall, 37 attorneys general from across the country urged the Senate to confirm Cordray, who was a former attorney general of Ohio, to lead the CFPB.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt 2:00 p.m., Maryland Attorney General Douglas Gansler, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper, and Republican Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff will hold an avail at the stakeout location here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 If the rain persists, we will advise a new location here.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso this afternoon, we will be hosting a call with Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker on the Cordray nomination. That call will happen at 12:30 p.m., and you can email us for call-in information.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would note that today the Conference of Mayors, 61 mayors from across the country, called on Congress to confirm Richard Cordray.\xc2\xa0 In addition, senior economic officials will be doing regional satellite time into key targeted states in advance of the vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as you all know, the CFPB is holding an event in Cleveland today where they will be announcing new "know before you owe" efforts to streamline and simplify credit card forms and help consumers better understand the terms and conditions of their credit card agreements.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I will turn I turn it over to Deputy Secretary Wolin.\xc2\xa0 I will stay after -- if you address your questions to him on this issue, and I will remain to take your questions on other issues.\xc2\xa0 I\'m aiming for a hard out at 11:00 a.m. because I have a meeting.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tGood morning.\xc2\xa0 As you all know, Congress passed financial reform 18 months ago, after a financial crisis that cost 9 million jobs and trillions of dollars in Americans\' wealth.\xc2\xa0 The CFPB was a critical piece of that reform, and it\'s already doing groundbreaking work on behalf of American consumers.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs part of its "know before you owe" campaigns, the CFPB has launched commonsense initiatives on mortgage disclosure forms and student aid agreements, and as Jay just mentioned, today they\'re launching a new initiative to create a model credit card agreement that is shorter, clearer, and explains terms up front.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese three commonsense initiatives can help millions make more informed financial decisions and avoid the traps of confused and fine print.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough the CFPB is doing excellent work already, the Dodd-Frank statute left critical authorities for protecting consumers contingent on their having a director.\xc2\xa0 Six months ago, the President nominated Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray -- former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray to serve as its first director.\xc2\xa0 He is exceptionally qualified.\xc2\xa0 Many industry and advocacy groups and in government have voiced strong support for him.\xc2\xa0 Thirty-seven state attorneys general, including a number of Republicans, have signed a letter in support.</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite those outstanding qualifications and the broad support for Mr. Cordray, many Senate Republicans have said they will not confirm any individual without fundamental changes to the Dodd-Frank statute.\xc2\xa0 Their position continues to leave the door wide open for the same abuses that occurred prior to, and were an important cause of the financial crisis that we are still feeling the effects of.</p>\n<p>\n\tWithout a director, the CFPB cannot oversee payday lenders, private student loan providers, and other non-bank lenders, including certain mortgage originators and servicers, as well as debt collectors and credit reporting agencies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis non-bank sector has been the source of some of the most harmful, deceptive, unfair and predatory lending practices.\xc2\xa0 And until a director is confirmed, these institutions will operate without supervision and oversight, just like before the crisis.\xc2\xa0 That means that millions of American people will remain vulnerable to some of the same regulatory gaps that helped to create the financial crisis, and they will lack basic common-sense protections of the sort I mentioned at the top.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, some have asserted that the CFPB will not have adequate accountability, and I wanted to address those assertions right now, because the CFPB has an unprecedented set of accountability provisions that make it, frankly, more accountable, uniquely amongst bank regulators.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, the CFPB has to consult with other bank regulators before issuing rules.\xc2\xa0 They have to do small business assessments and subject themselves to small business panels.\xc2\xa0 Their rules can be overturned by another body of the government, the Financial Stability Oversight Council.\xc2\xa0 All of these things are unique amongst federal bank regulators.\xc2\xa0 No other federal bank regulator has to go through those levels of oversight and scrutiny and accountability.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, it is the only federal bank regulator that has a funding cap, again, making it more constrained than any other federal banking agency.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd finally, there is a kind of very thorough arrangement of oversight for this bureau.\xc2\xa0 It is required to report to Congress twice a year with respect to its financial reports.\xc2\xa0 It is required to testify before the Congress twice a year.\xc2\xa0 The GAO is explicitly tasked with performing an independent audit of its operations.\xc2\xa0 And of course, it is susceptible to an inspection general who is independent.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in all of these ways, Congress, in considering and ultimately enacting the CFPB provisions of the Dodd-Frank statute, made sure that this was a bureau that would be both transparent and accountable to the Congress, to the American people, in ways that are unprecedented amongst its federal banking regulatory colleagues.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the sum of all this of course is that both because the American consumers need to have the protections that they deserve and because the President has nominated an extremely qualified, outstanding individual to be its first director, we believe the Senate should act in the best interest of the American people and confirm tomorrow Richard Cordray as the first director of the CFPB.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to take questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Neal, one of the concerns is raised by Senator Susan Collins who voted for Dodd-Frank, I believe, is that she thinks Congress should have oversight over the budget of this board.\xc2\xa0 She said, in a time of crippling deficits, having the board be able to -- the bureau be able to decide its own budget up to $500 million doesn\'t make any sense.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could address that, and also the fact that Senator McConnell said that Republican senators wrote seven months ago to the White House noting -- or maybe this is a better question for Jay -- but noting their concerns, and they have yet to hear back from the White House in an official capacity about those concerns.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 I think on the funding thing, Jake, first of all, no federal bank regulator has appropriated funds.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is we want to make sure that our bank regulators are free of political influence.\xc2\xa0 And so they all have independence, and we think that, like all the others, in terms of raising the funds for their own operations, the CFPB should be treated similarly.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnique among them, however, as I noted in my introduction, the CFPB does have a funding cap, and if they wanted any more money beyond that they will have to go to Congress to seek that money.\xc2\xa0 That is more constrained than any other federal bank regulator.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, both because we want bank regulation in this country to be free of political influence, and we want to make sure that the CFPB is treated as much as possible similarly to its banking colleagues, that the provisions that are in the statute are appropriate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, on the question of the letter from the 44 senators, I would say this:\xc2\xa0 The Congress spent many, many months discussing what the appropriate governance structure of the CFPB should be\xc2\xa0 -- I would say both Democrats and Republicans very much involved in those conversations.\xc2\xa0 And in the end, Congress decided on a set of checks and balances; a governance structure that would have all kinds of accountability provisions that were, as I noted above, unprecedented.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so Congress then passed that legislation; the President signed it.\xc2\xa0 It is now the law of the country.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s our view that we should go ahead and implement the law of the country, especially when what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here is a law that in very common-sense, very practical, very sort of real ways, is about protecting consumers from the kinds of complicated language and traps that they were all too often subjected to before the statute was enacted, and were, meaningfully, a cause of the financial crisis that we\xe2\x80\x99ve just been going through.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick follow.\xc2\xa0 Do you view the concerns raised by Republican senators as legitimate, principled concerns about this bureau, or does the Obama administration view this as obstructionism and they just oppose the bureau and they\xe2\x80\x99ll do everything they can do stop it?</p>\n<p>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think Congress had an opportunity and did, in fact, have a very robust discussion about what the appropriate governance and accountability structures for this agency would be.\xc2\xa0 Most of these concerns were not raised at the time.\xc2\xa0 In fact, one of the things that some Republican senators have objected to is having a single head of the agency. Now, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t objected to the fact that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is another very important bank regulator, has for 100 years had a single director.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, in the Dodd-Frank statute itself, not only was there no effort to make the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency subject to a multimember commission as its governing structure, but the OCC was actually given additional authorities.\xc2\xa0 The Office of Thrift Supervision was folded into this entity that has a single director.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, look, I think in the end, Jake, what\xe2\x80\x99s important here is that the work of the CFPB is critically important for American consumers and for our economy.\xc2\xa0 The Congress had a very robust, very thorough debate about what the structure should look like.\xc2\xa0 They came up with a set of solutions that is unprecedented in terms of its level of accountability vis-\xc3\xa0-vis any other bank regulator, and the President has put forward an extraordinary individual to be the first director.\xc2\xa0 And we think we should get on now with the business of -- the Senate should get on with the business of confirming Mr. Cordray as director so that this agency can protect American consumers.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If Cordray\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation does not go through, and getting him in place is as important as you all say it is, will the President consider a recess appointment?</p>\n<p>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, as Jay noted at the top, the Senate has a vote scheduled for tomorrow on Mr. Cordray. We think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the Senate to act.\xc2\xa0 I would note, by the way, that at least one Republican senator has already announced his support for Mr. Cordray.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the Senate should act on this matter.\xc2\xa0 We think that the case for their doing so, both because of the importance of the substance and because of the quality of the individual, is overwhelming.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not for me to speculate about what comes thereafter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, the vote is going to fail.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are 45 Republican senators who said they\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote against it.\xc2\xa0 The outcome of the vote is not really in doubt.</p>\n<p>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Again, let\xe2\x80\x99s see what the vote is. It\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled for tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 The Senate should vote.\xc2\xa0 As I said, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat it, that one Republican senator has announced his support.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what happens.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not for me here today to announce what comes thereafter.\xc2\xa0 We hope that the Senate takes into account the importance of this.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we should all take a step back -- because the question here is should the American people have commonsense, clear disclosure?\xc2\xa0 Should they understand when they take out a mortgage, when they take out a student loan, when they buy a car and so forth, what are they getting themselves into and what aren\xe2\x80\x99t they getting themselves into, or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s really what\xe2\x80\x99s at the heart of this.\xc2\xa0 When you abstract all of the rhetoric and you pull away from all of the tos and fros here, the question is, is that something that the American people should have, or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xc2\xa0 And our view overwhelmingly, of course, is that they should.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And if I could just add on that, Hans, everything I read at the top about what state attorneys general are doing and what mayors are doing -- this is not an exercise designed for anything except to put pressure on the Senate to do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it because we still believe there is a chance and there is a hope, and certainly the American people deserve this vote to clear the bar and for the obstructionist behavior to stop.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what I also believe, Hans, politically, is that those senators who vote against or said -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve come out and said they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for anybody.\xc2\xa0 So they will then have to explain to their constituents why they did not support commonsense reforms, the implementation of the kind of consumer protections that Neal was talking about.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s some time now for them to reconsider that position, and we hope they do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what they\'re saying about that is that you just go ahead and have the commission, right, set it up like the FTIC, set it up like -- I mean --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just refer to what Neal said about all the deliberations that went into the governing structure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- assuming that the vote --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying this as though we should then never have a vote, never hold senators to account and never have them on the record for their opposition to something the American people overwhelmingly support.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is this just an exercise in holding their feet to the fire?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that politics is a wondrous thing, and sometimes opinions change.</p>\n<p>\n\tLaura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One is, do you think that essentially what the Republican opposition to this has done is forced sort of a relitigation of this entire debate, both on their side, trying to open up what the law says, and on your side, making the case, again, as you did initially?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this essentially redoing that debate?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the second question I would have is, why didn\'t you guys nominate a director sooner when -- before they sent this letter and before when you maybe had a little more momentum coming out of passage?</p>\n<p>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Look, on redoing the debate, I think -- the statute passed.\xc2\xa0 It is the law of the country.\xc2\xa0 And we think we should get on with implementing it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just an academic exercise.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just a political exercise.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an exercise about protecting American consumers and ultimately our financial system from the kinds of catastrophic outcomes that we\xe2\x80\x99ve all just experienced.\xc2\xa0 This is very real, very tangible, very present.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think one has to ask themselves the question of who is it that the Senate Republicans are trying to protect.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clearly not the American consumers, because having a director is critical to making sure that consumers have the protections they need with respect to payday lenders and mortgage servicers and so forth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s clearly not the banks, because the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau already has authority vis-\xc3\xa0-vis the banks.\xc2\xa0 And what is happening right now is there\xe2\x80\x99s an unlevel playing field in which the banks are subject to supervision and enforcement and the non-banks are able to do the kinds of predatory behavior that caused this problem in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s not for the financial system, because we know that the financial system is going to be stronger when everyone is subject to these good, commonsense rules and supervision around those rules.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the question is what is this about.\xc2\xa0 And from our perspective, what this is about is making sure, as I said now a number of times, that our financial system and the American consumers are well looked after in the way that Congress, when they passed the statute in the first place, contemplated.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So who are they looking out for?</p>\n<p>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 I think you have to ask them that question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no obvious -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no obvious answer to me to that question.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question to ask.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you nominate someone sooner?</p>\n<p>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not for me to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a year.</p>\n<p>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 -- speak to that.\xc2\xa0 But we have now -- the President has now nominated, and did some time ago, an exceptionally qualified individual, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been pending before the Senate for a long, long time.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s time for the Senate to act.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I agree with what Neal said.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJen and then Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not for you to say?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he went on to answer the question.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Cordray has been nominated now for quite a long period of time.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s enormously qualified, has the support of Republicans and Democrats across the country, and is the right person for the job.\xc2\xa0 It was a very deliberate effort to find the right person for the job; we found the right person for the job.\xc2\xa0 And a suggestion that you put forward, that Republican obstructionism was less fervent a few months ago than it is now, is a novel reimagining of recent history.</p>\n<p>\n\tJen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President reached out to any of these Republican senators who are being targeted?</p>\n<p>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say this:\xc2\xa0 The administration broadly, at a whole range of levels, has been working very actively for a long time on Mr. Cordray\xe2\x80\x99s nomination, reaching out to senators.\xc2\xa0 And Jay has obviously outlined earlier what today\xe2\x80\x99s elements are, but there has been plenty of outreach up and down the line.\xc2\xa0 And Jay can comment more specifically.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The answer is yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He has directly --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President -- well, the White House has.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific communications to read out that the President has had.\xc2\xa0 But we have been actively engaged in trying to turn no to yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s been direct contact this week with some of those Republicans asking for -- from the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Without giving a timeframe to it, within the context of this effort to get this confirmation, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tSorry, I said Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can this agency function without a director?</p>\n<p>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s doing awfully good work right now as I tried to describe, and I just gave a summary of it.\xc2\xa0 But the point is -- and so it can do a series of things.\xc2\xa0 But it is hamstrung in the sense that its full set of authorities are not available to it by statute until it has a director in place.\xc2\xa0 And so the key element that it needs to focus on, and it cannot focus on until it has a director in place, is this non-bank sector and the financial services industry -- so payday lenders, mortgage servicers, credit card companies and so forth.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd these are places where a lot of damage was done to consumers and to our financial system in the years leading up to our financial crisis.\xc2\xa0 So this is a place where we really need as a country to make sure that consumers are being properly protected and that they\xe2\x80\x99re being brought within the regulatory fold so that we can avoid precisely what we\xe2\x80\x99ve all just been through.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I say this is not just a academic or a political exercise.\xc2\xa0 This is one that\xe2\x80\x99s very real and ought to be in the memories of every American.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we live -- we\'re still living through that damage.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the most important, specific thing that the agency can\xe2\x80\x99t do that it could do if you got Mr. Cordray approved?</p>\n<p>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 It cannot supervise or largely enforce the rules that exist on consumer protection vis-\xc3\xa0-vis non-bank entities -- so payday lenders, student loan providers, credit rating agencies, debt collectors, mortgage servicers unless they happen to be part of a bank.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if it\xe2\x80\x99s not a bank -- and millions and millions of Americans, tens and tens of millions of Americans, engage with those entities every day -- payday lenders, debt collectors, student loan companies, and so forth.\xc2\xa0 And the CFPB does not have capacity, does not have authority, to supervise those entities until there\'s a director.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Knoller, and then I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let Neal go so I can take five minutes for other issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Neal, how did those provisions get written into the law?\xc2\xa0 Usually, an agency is given powers, but here it\xe2\x80\x99s the director himself, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you realize it at the time you went along with the legislation?</p>\n<p>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Well, the legislative process, Mark, is obviously a very complicated thing.\xc2\xa0 And some parts of it we contributed to directly and other parts, obviously, the Hill contributed to.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not how we would have done it, to be sure, but we knew from enactment that in order to get these additional powers there would need to be a director confirmed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, did this come up in the meeting with the Dem leadership?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the readout of that meeting, yes.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDEPUTY SECRETARY WOLIN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, Neal.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'ve got five minutes on other stuff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I clarify something you said earlier?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that administration officials had contacted some of the senators\' offices, but we have a statement we got earlier today from a spokesman from McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s office that said they checked with all their members and they say no administration officials had called them.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just know for a fact that\xe2\x80\x99s not true.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to follow up on Matt\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 There are times when the President will anticipate congressional action and say, if they do that, here is how I\'ll respond.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, he said, if there is any effort to weaken Wall Street reforms I\'ll veto it.\xc2\xa0 So isn\xe2\x80\x99t it viable or even in fact likely that if Cordray isn\xe2\x80\x99t confirmed that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be the subject of a recess appointment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We took this question, and I want to focus for today on what we don\'t believe is an exercise, and that we don\'t believe we should let Republicans who oppose this for the wrong reasons off the hook.\xc2\xa0 They need to vote.\xc2\xa0 And we hope enough of them will vote to confirm -- to allow this nomination to go through, and for Mr. Cordray to be confirmed.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get ahead of that important vote tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know you said you didn\'t have a readout on the Senate Dems\' meeting as it relates to this issue, but could you speak more broadly about what the President wanted to accomplish today with that meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 With the Senate Democrats?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are obviously a lot of important issues going on in Congress, as I\'ve talked about from this podium.\xc2\xa0 The President and every member of his team will be engaged in working with Congress to try to get the many issues that need to be resolved before Congress adjourns on its vacation completed in time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Matt.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Syrian President Assad denied in an interview with Barbara Walters that he\'s ordered a crackdown on his people, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cOnly the crazy leader kills his own people.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the White House put any credibility in these kind of claims?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Response to it, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s just not credible.\xc2\xa0 Everyone is -- the world has witnessed what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in Syria.\xc2\xa0 The United States and many, many other nations around the world who have come together to condemn the atrocious violence in Syria perpetrated by the Assad regime know exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s happening and who is responsible.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think anybody who watched that interview would find Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s answers credible.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jay has got time for two more.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Two more.\xc2\xa0 Landler and Kristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any additional information on President Zardari\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Dubai for medical treatment, whether that is, in fact, what it is, or whether, as some have suggested, there\xe2\x80\x99s more going on?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything beyond to say that we have seen the reports, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard what the -- I guess the government spokesman has said.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly hope -- wish him a speedy recovery from his medical condition.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a reaction to Babbitt\xe2\x80\x99s resignation beyond what --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrei -- we\xe2\x80\x99re moving so fast.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Andrei, and then yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because of the election in Russia, I was looking at the issue of voting rights, and I came across an NAACP report here out this week, and they described in very dramatic terms the efforts to suppress voting rights for African Americans, Latino Americans throughout this country, in 34 states.\xc2\xa0 Sounds counterintuitive to me, given the current President at the White House.\xc2\xa0 My question to you is, are you aware of that, and if so, what are you doing about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 We obviously take very seriously any effort to disenfranchise Americans or somehow restrict or prevent them from voting.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a very serious matter.\xc2\xa0 And I believe the Justice Department can answer more fully with regard to specific issues around the country in that regard.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast question.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the President aware of the role of DEA in money-laundering with the Mexican drug cartels, as was reported in The New York Times on Sunday?\xc2\xa0 I mean, if not, he is requesting information, and is aware -- when he was first informed about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Informed about?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The role of the DEA on the money-laundering for the Mexican drug --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that discussion with him, and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:58 A.M.
