EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you start by just telling us what you have learned and what you know about these reports?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I am watching much of what you\xe2\x80\x99re watching.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, we\xe2\x80\x99re watching, I think, a very fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for and what the President spoke about many days ago remains our priority: an orderly transition to a free and fair elections.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for remains unchanged.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Leon Panetta apparently has said that it is likely that Mubarak will step down today.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you can confirm?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re watching a very fluid situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he have the authorization to say that today in Congress?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am watching a very fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what question elicited what testimony, so I want to -- without having seen that, I think that would be tough for me to comment on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say what kind of briefings the President has had this morning or on the plane?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President, right before he walked out of the Oval Office, was -- right before he walked out of the Oval Office to the helicopter was in with Tom Donilon, our National Security Advisor, and there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a whole lot since then.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President seeing these reports, and if this is the outcome, does the White House welcome that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- the President is -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99re watching the same thing you are.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge what might happen later today because, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re watching the situation.\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me finish.\xc2\xa0 But I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear in the many preceding days that what we have wanted to see and, most importantly, what the people of Egypt wanted to see was irreversible change.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll monitor throughout the day what\xe2\x80\x99s happening there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we expect to hear from the President on this himself?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, depending on what happens and what the situations warrant.\xc2\xa0 What is that thing, by the way?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s radio equipment.\xc2\xa0 Pretty cool, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if that was like a small robot.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the White House be happy with Suleiman in -- as control in the interim government or any capacity?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get over the tips of my skis on this one.\xc2\xa0 I will endeavor to get us the best information throughout the day, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into a series of hypotheticals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any clarity on whether power could transfer directly to Suleiman under the constitution?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have an inkling of that, but let me get better clarification from those that have a better reading of the Egyptian constitution.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify on the timing of what the President knew, when he had the briefing with Donilon, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t learned anything new since being on the plane and watching this?\xc2\xa0 He was well aware that all of this was -- these reports were going to happen?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to get a sense of like, what we\xe2\x80\x99re watching unfold, the news breaking, I mean, this was not something that he was surprised about when he watched on --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I guess I want to be clear, we are in contact with our embassy, obviously, in Cairo.\xc2\xa0 We are watching the reports that you are.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what -- I do not know what the outcome of what is happening today will be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he\xe2\x80\x99s planning to step down?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re watching this just as you are.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President be calling Mubarak today, or any plans for that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I -- this is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the last time you\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we will -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to monitor what happens and react as the situation warrants.\xc2\xa0 And if we -- if I have updates to that I\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly let you guys know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just give us a little bit of color about him watching it up there right now?\xc2\xa0 Is he sitting in his office?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, he\xe2\x80\x99s in the conference room with many of us watching this on television.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so in the briefing with Donilon this morning, was it presented to the President that this could be an outcome today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was not in the briefing with Donilon.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to -- I say that not to foreshadow that anything was or wasn\xe2\x80\x99t said.\xc2\xa0 I just -- to simply say -- because Mike asked me sort of what updates had the President gotten throughout the morning on this, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the known update that he got from Donilon.\xc2\xa0 I do not know what they spoke of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when he got on the plane, did you get the feeling that he already knew that this was a possibility, or did he find out on CNN like the rest of us?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into that.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re in a very fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 So I will endeavor to keep you guys up to date as much as we get information on.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re -- we continue to be in contact with the White House, and as situations and events warrant we will keep you apprised.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anybody on this trip that would be briefing him, or would he be getting calls, as you say, from --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, and obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s -- Alyssa Mastromonaco as the Deputy Chief of Staff is on board, as is Mona Sutphen.\xc2\xa0 So the President -- and we obviously travel with a complement of folks from the NSC that can keep the President apprised of any developments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any scheduling changes for today\xe2\x80\x99s trip being taken into --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not at the moment, no.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is CNN wrong to be reporting that Suleiman is going to take over?\xc2\xa0 Because they\xe2\x80\x99re reporting that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t begin, Kate, to understand or even why I would comment on what their sourcing is.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not in any position to know what CNN is sourcing this off of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the sources is Leon Panetta.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go any further than I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone today, guys.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the same topic -- does the administration have any evidence -- there are reports in The Guardian about the Egyptian government detaining citizens -- some of the protestors.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have any comment on that? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not see those particular reports, but, look, our position on harassment and on detention is no different than it\xe2\x80\x99s been the entire time, and that is that it is up to the government -- the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens, to ensure that those that want to exercise the right of protest are able to do so peacefully; that violence cannot be the outcome and should not be the answer to the grievances from those in Egypt and in Tahrir Square.\xc2\xa0 And if anybody has been detained we would obviously call for them to be released.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the usefulness of events like the ones the President is going to have today given the attention that\xe2\x80\x99s being paid, not just throughout the country, throughout the world, to what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Egypt?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, if there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that -- if there\xe2\x80\x99s one lesson from my more than two years here is that there have rarely been days that only one thing occupies the workspace or the imagination of all levels of the White House.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think the -- inherent in the job of being President is dealing with multiple things simultaneously.\xc2\xa0 And whether it is a crisis in Egypt, whether it is the investments that we have to undertake to rebuild our economy and compete to win the future, those all happen, again, simultaneously.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of bandwidth in the White House to deal with --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nice, you used the word \xe2\x80\x9cbandwidth.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I like that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying desperately to get the Internet on the news tonight -- bandwidth in the White House to deal with multiple problems.\xc2\xa0 And probably with that Axelrodian pun, I should probably sit down.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more non-Egypt question.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have a comment on India and Pakistan returning to talks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that the idea of them sitting down and having peace talks is something that the President has encouraged and we hope will be productive in their outcome.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About the spending, like expanding wireless access or high-speed rail, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President\xe2\x80\x99s numbers on the deficit not be very strong -- a lot of Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t think that he was really committed to reining in the deficit.\xc2\xa0 So how does he push this sort of spending --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably, Athena, based your question on some overnight Gallup poll that likely will show a 10-point swing with nothing happening in a matter of only days.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, separately from the poll then.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say that what the American people want us to do is -- and I think is also clear from much public polling -- they want us to take important steps to reduce the deficit, but in those steps to reduce the deficit they don\xe2\x80\x99t want us to make harmful cuts in important investments that will help this country compete in the future.\xc2\xa0 That is -- much like a family would -- a family that is struggling with their finances is not going to cut things like sending a child to college as a way of succeeding in the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President be able to convince the Republican Congress to go along with that, given their aversion to spending?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The answer to that will probably outlast even my next day here, so I think that -- again, I think the American people want us to take the steps that the President has talked about but do so in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t harm our ability to compete.\xc2\xa0 And I would say, when you see the budget on Monday, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a five-year freeze, $400 billion in cuts, and the smallest percentage of government spending as it relates to our economy since Eisenhower was in office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about decisions like on heating assistance?\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the difficultly of balancing those kind of decisions with the investments you\xe2\x80\x99re calling for?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, without getting into specifics, obviously we, as Jack said in his op-ed over the weekend, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make some tough decisions and that will sometimes -- that\xe2\x80\x99s going to include programs that are important to everybody.\xc2\xa0 But we know that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make some of those tough decisions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bundle up, because I can assure you it is -- when we left it was -2\xc2\xb0 in Marquette.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure I would rush to put sunscreen on because it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten a whole lot warmer, so bundle up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on the House -- the GOP budget?\xc2\xa0 Any comment on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nothing more than I had yesterday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last Egypt question, Robert.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Before the events that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen today, did you guys have the impression at all that Mubarak was trying to wait out the protesters?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to what President Mubarak knows.\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, I think you have watched the crowds get larger and larger because they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as if the demands that they had and the concerns for opportunity and freedom are being adequately addressed.\xc2\xa0 So I think unless or until irreversible change comes, bigger crowds will happen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That dinging means we\xe2\x80\x99re about to land, so please sit down, buckle up, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see you in a few minutes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:33 A.M.
