EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 So one logistic note.\xc2\xa0 So the fundraiser in the private home tonight, I know the guidance says pool, but it\xe2\x80\x99s apparently a pretty small fundraiser, a pretty small room, so we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to have room for one pooler, like we did in Minneapolis this last weekend -- which you\xe2\x80\x99ll all see when we get there.\xc2\xa0 But there you have it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, the Rhode Island Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Caprio, had some choice words for the President about his non-endorsement.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction from the White House or from the President himself?\xc2\xa0 And are you guys endorsing anybody in this race?\xc2\xa0 Is he endorsing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, for starters, the President is really thrilled that he can go to Rhode Island today and talk about the important issue of small businesses and what we need to do to help lift them up and create an environment where they can be creating jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs President, the President signed into law some 16 tax cuts for small businesses and is continuing to work to make sure that capital is freed up, and that they\xe2\x80\x99re in a position where they can be putting more Americans back to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs it relates to the local politics, out of respect for his friend, Lincoln Chafee, the President decided not to get involved in this race.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI know that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99re entering the final week of the election season, and emotions are running pretty high.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody is surprised to see people feeling particularly strongly about these races.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any update on the rare earth minerals?\xc2\xa0 I know last week you guys were checking with NSC.\xc2\xa0 Have they gotten back to you?\xc2\xa0 Anything new?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you right now, no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the controversy?\xc2\xa0 Karzai is saying that Iran gives him bags of cash, literally.\xc2\xa0 Have you seen the press conference that he held?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comments to that, about Iranians\xe2\x80\x99 contributions, cash contributions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I have seen those reports, and I think the American people and the global community have every reason to believe that -- or every reason to be concerned about Iran trying to have a negative influence on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 But they have a responsibility just like all their neighbors to try to have a positive influence on the formation of a government there, and to ensure that Afghanistan is not a country where terrorists can find safe harbor, or where attacks can be planned on their soil.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo as you know, the President has, from day one, worked to build strong governance to fight corruption in that country.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to work with our partners in Afghanistan and in the region to do just that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s -- sorry, just one follow-up.\xc2\xa0 But Karzai was also saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s been known that the U.S. is giving out cash to these offices, to various government offices and officials.\xc2\xa0 Has President Obama been aware of this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I mean, the United States has been giving aid to Afghanistan to help with the building of governance, but on the specifics of what -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the specifics of what we know and don\xe2\x80\x99t know, specifically.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any corroboration of this story that Iran is giving bags full of cash?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, like I just said, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into what we know or don\xe2\x80\x99t know necessarily.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reason to doubt it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON: I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to leave it at that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about the President\xe2\x80\x99s mood?\xc2\xa0 This is the final stretch of the campaign.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his mood like?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s in a fighting mood.\xc2\xa0 When we got on Marine One just now, he said that he\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiastic to get out there and make sure that the American people understand the stakes and the choice that they have before them in this election.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGreg Sargent wrote something interesting, or pointed out something interesting on the Washington Post website just now, that if you pick up the new National Journal, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see two interviews with very different takes on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the world. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got an interview with the President, talking about how he\xe2\x80\x99s worked with Republicans and how he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to try to work with Republicans, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got an interview with Mitch McConnell, in which he says his number one job is to make sure that Barack Obama is a one-term president.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo there are obviously very high stakes in this election, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the stakes between are we going to continue to make progress or are we going to continue to allow a situation where there\xe2\x80\x99s obstruction and people who are trying to stop the progress we\xe2\x80\x99re making on the economy, on health care, and all the things that are important to the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo the President\xe2\x80\x99s mood is -- his spirits are high, and he\xe2\x80\x99s happy to go out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he feel like his message -- the way he\xe2\x80\x99s delivering it now -- does he feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s getting through?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He feels like we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good message and that the American people, as they get more and more engaged in these races, as they are now, see clearly what the stakes are.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of angry Democrats about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Rhode Island today.\xc2\xa0 If the President lived in Rhode Island, would he vote for Caprio?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the head of the party.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the effort to get a back-door answer to the President getting involved in this race, but he\xe2\x80\x99s just not going to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any friends in politics outside the Democratic Party, other than Lincoln Chafee?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure, absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In those cases, has he declined to make an endorsement?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Boy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, race by race, I can\xe2\x80\x99t -- you got me stumped.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know race by race.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the answer is no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any other races in which he\xe2\x80\x99s declined to endorse the Democrat?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave it at what I said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Surely you would know if there are other races where the Democratic president has not endorsed the Democratic candidate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You know the answer -- you answer the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President prepared to deal with whatever blowback could come if Caprio loses this race?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President is -- the President feels comfortable with what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing in this race.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The line from the White House, though, is the President is doing everything he can to get Democrats elected.\xc2\xa0 This is a very obvious exception to that.\xc2\xa0 How do you reconcile that?\xc2\xa0 It stops in a blue state or it stops on matters of friendship?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s feeling is that he has respect for his friend Lincoln Chafee and he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get involved in this race.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House view that this congressional election, the midterms, is not only a referendum on his policies but also on his style, his communication skills?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that to the pundits.\xc2\xa0 But what the President thinks is that this election is about a choice.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a choice of what direction you want the country to move in.\xc2\xa0 If you want it to -- do you want us to continue to make progress economically, continue to create an environment where jobs are being created in the private sector?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President is not satisfied with the pace of how things are going, but things are moving in a much different direction than they were when he took office, and what Americans -- what the President thinks Americans should be asking themselves is do we want to keep moving forward or do we want to go back to the policies of the past that got us into this mess.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the view that -- from his critics that his actual persona is part of the problem, that he\xe2\x80\x99s out of -- that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t connect well with the public at a certain level, that he\xe2\x80\x99s too aloof?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, when you\xe2\x80\x99re President of the United States you have people who will criticize just about anything that you\xe2\x80\x99re doing, anything you say or how you say it.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the job, and the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind that.\xc2\xa0 But if you were there in Columbus where 37,000 Ohioans were out there feeling pretty enthusiastic about the direction of the country and the President\xe2\x80\x99s message, then I would say that maybe some of those critics are missing some of these events.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Appreciate it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:14 P.M.
