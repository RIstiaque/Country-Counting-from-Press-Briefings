Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t3:16 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your patience.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore I get started, I wanted to read a statement from me on the President\xe2\x80\x99s phone call with Russian President Medvedev.\xc2\xa0 President Obama spoke with the Russian President today to congratulate him on the World Trade Organization\xe2\x80\x99s decision to extend a formal invitation to Russia to join the WTO.\xc2\xa0 The Presidents -- collect, that\xe2\x80\x99s plural -- the Presidents hailed this achievement as yet another result of the reset in bilateral relations, which will benefit both the United States and Russia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRussia\xe2\x80\x99s membership in the WTO will lower tariffs, improve access to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s services markets, hold the Russian government accountable to a system of rules governing trade behavior, and provide the means to enforce those rules.\xc2\xa0 Russia\xe2\x80\x99s membership in the WTO will generate more export opportunities for American manufacturers and farmers, which in turn will support well-paying jobs in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 President Obama told President Medvedev that the administration is committed to working with Congress to end the application of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to Russia in order to ensure that American firms and American exporters will enjoy the same benefits of Russian WTO membership as their international competitors.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe two Presidents also discussed the recent elections and subsequent demonstrations in Russia.\xc2\xa0 President Obama raised the reports of flaws in the way the elections were conducted, and welcomed President Medvedev\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to investigate these allegations.\xc2\xa0 President Obama also noted the peaceful demonstrations held throughout Russia, and praised how Russian government authorities enabled the permissive conditions that allowed those demonstrations to occur peacefully and lawfully.\xc2\xa0 President Obama noted how this expression of civil society is consistent with the modernizing Russia that President Medvedev has sought to foster over the last four years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe two Presidents said they looked forward to meeting next year -- meeting next, rather, at the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, South Korea, in March 2012.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is my readout.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll get something to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any calls with Putin?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is the only call I have to read out to you, President to President, if you will.\xc2\xa0 Also, before I get started, I just want to say that I know you all have a lot of questions about the negotiations happening now on Capitol Hill to resolve and come to a conclusion on the payroll tax cut extension and unemployment insurance extension, and I know those -- the questions you\xe2\x80\x99re asking are the same, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, that the American people, or at least those Americans who are paying close attention, are asking.\xc2\xa0 And I appreciate them, but I just want to warn you that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to have a lot of details to give to you, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give you a status update on a situation that obviously is quite fluid.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you have seen, we take heart in the statements by the leaders in the Senate from both parties, as well as others on Capitol Hill, that progress is being made and this will be resolved, which will mean that the President\xe2\x80\x99s priority of ensuring that Americans do not have their taxes go up on January 1st will be met.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to that happening, and are cautiously optimistic that it will happen.\xc2\xa0 Having said that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to have a lot of details to give you on the process.</p>\n<p>\n\tBen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll try --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to ask anyway.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll try a couple -- at least one in particular, I think, that\xe2\x80\x99s very fundamental to this.\xc2\xa0 The President was direct last week when he was with Prime Minister Harper when asked about the connection between the payroll tax and Keystone.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cAny effort to try to tie Keystone to the payroll tax cut, I will reject.\xc2\xa0 So everyone should be on notice.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The House and Senate Republicans have insisted today that the Keystone language be attached.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty basic point here that if the Keystone language is attached, would he in fact sign it into law, or would he reject it, as he said last week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the President made clear that he opposes these kinds of extraneous issues being inserted into a tax cut bill.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s quite clear that an oil pipeline has nothing to do with the payroll taxes that everyone in this room who gets a paycheck pays every week or two weeks when they get their paycheck, and that every American out there -- 160 million Americans, rather -- pay.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s focus is on getting that bill passed to ensure that Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up in 15 days.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat he was referring to at the time hypothetically had to do, as I mentioned the other day, with the idea that a bill -- any kind of provision that would try to force a decision or mandate a decision -- or approval, rather -- mandate approval.\xc2\xa0 I would also note the statement that the State Department put out pretty clearly the other day in response to the language that exists currently in the House Republican payroll tax cut proposal, and what that would mean in terms of short-circuiting an absolutely necessary process to properly and carefully review the alternate route or routes in Nebraska that need to be studied here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving said all that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prejudge a final product that does not yet exist.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t asked specifically about -- or he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into language of, if it mandates me to do this, that\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine, but if it calls for a provision that the State Department rejects -- he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAny effort to tie the two I\xe2\x80\x99ll reject.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I was just trying to get clear that people want to know if the tax cut extension will be approved or not, would he sign it into law, or does it depend on what it looks like?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of the process.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s see where it ends and let\xe2\x80\x99s hope it ends with Congress not leaving town, going on a month-long vacation, having decided that it\xe2\x80\x99s okay for 160 million Americans to get a tax hike on January 1st.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s priority is ensuring that Americans do not get that tax hike.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis money is vital -- this tax cut is vital to every American family that\xe2\x80\x99s trying to make ends meet.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s vital to the economy.\xc2\xa0 As countless economists, independent economists have said, the payroll tax cut as well as the unemployment insurance are provisions that are some of the most effective provisions when it comes to giving momentum to economic growth and adding jobs.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s his focus.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said -- but in that you said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll see where it ends.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Just so I\xe2\x80\x99m clear, that sounds pretty different than a veto threat, yes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would point you to what the President said.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to what the State Department said about the specific language that was later put forward in the House Republican proposal.\xc2\xa0 What absolutely is the case is that this is pure politics, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from statements by Republicans who -- one who said something like, Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really -- essentially implying he didn\xe2\x80\x99t really know much about what it was for, but if the President is against it, he\xe2\x80\x99s for it.\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 And, I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s really a hard argument to make here that a pipeline has anything to do with whether or not middle-class Americans get a tax cut next year.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s extraneous.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m answering Ben here.\xc2\xa0 But the -- again, let\xe2\x80\x99s -- it is not appropriate for me at this point to negotiate from the podium to say that this specific provision or this language is unacceptable, but this language is okay because the folks who are working that out have enough on their shoulders as it is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very last one.\xc2\xa0 You were also clear yesterday the White House would not accept a promise from the House GOP about passing the omnibus, leaving town and then coming back.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said that was unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 It seems like that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just be clear.\xc2\xa0 There are different ways of looking at this in terms of what a deal would look like.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a guarantee and there\xe2\x80\x99s a promise.\xc2\xa0 And again, without getting into specifics, the President insists that there be an absolute assurance that Congress will not let Americans experience a tax cut -- a tax hike, rather, on January 1st, so that is why members are working hard right now to try to fashion an acceptable compromise.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in that process, and we hope that it bears fruit because it\xe2\x80\x99s essential that Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have that tax hike.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt would be awkward, I think, for members of Congress to have to go home and explain on vacation why folks who are out there struggling to pay the rent or the mortgage or tuition, car payment that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to see more taken out of their paycheck come January 1st because Congress couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get its act together on this thing that Republicans and Democrats, at least now, support.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at where we began here.\xc2\xa0 The payroll tax cut extension is being debated now as it has been for several months because the President put it on the table.\xc2\xa0 He made it a central plank of his American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 Earlier in this process, Republican after Republican cast doubt on whether Republicans even supported giving tax cuts to the middle class.\xc2\xa0 They pooh-poohed the suggestion that it helps the economy, I guess deciding that they knew better than economists who are independent and who know very well that there are few better ways to help the economy than a payroll tax cut or unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99ve changed their tune.\xc2\xa0 That is a welcome metamorphosis.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully it will result in Americans getting that tax cut next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you think if they leave, they will come back?\xc2\xa0 You believe that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- that\xe2\x80\x99s up to the leaders on the Hill to work out.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Matt.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could try again on the pipeline, the Keystone pipeline.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You heard -- you did hear the beginning, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did hear --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that you would not rule out the President signing a bill for an extension of the payroll tax break that would include language related to the Keystone project?\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling that out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to go beyond anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve said with regard to this matter already, which is the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement, the assessment by the State Department of the specific language in the House Republican bill, and I think the point I made yesterday or the day before about the company that\xe2\x80\x99s requesting the permit, noting that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t even identified an alternate route yet so the whole 60-day thing is pretty specious.</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, there is a process at work -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to analyze what language would be acceptable and what wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I will let the process run its course.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there is the possibility of some diluted --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have another answer for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the possibility of some diluted language on Keystone that might pass muster for the administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other answer to give you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that the House has put the budget -- the spending bill on the way to full congressional passage, can you give a sense of how soon you might expect the payroll tax break issue would be resolved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today?\xc2\xa0 Through the weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think as I said earlier, it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- these things are very fluid, and I think for as long as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing it in this job and observing in Washington that the last days and hours of a congressional session are very hard to predict, and they tend to -- issues tend to be resolved at the last minute.\xc2\xa0 So beyond that, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get specific in my predictions about how this will play out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s important that it get done.\xc2\xa0 It is essential that it get done because if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, Congress will be testing the proposition of whether or not they can go below 9 percent in public approval and whether or not they can go above 45 or 50 percent in the judgment of the American people that it\xe2\x80\x99s the worst Congress in history.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just looking at the omnibus bill, were your concerns all addressed satisfactorily?\xc2\xa0 And will the President sign that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is a pretty fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics.\xc2\xa0 We obviously had some issues, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned.\xc2\xa0 And those issues have been and are being addressed.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that we are heartened by the tone that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard up on the Hill and the cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on both sides and a -- the stated goal here being that both the spending bill, as well as the payroll tax cut and UI extension, will get done and done in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t harm the economy, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stick it to the middle class, but done in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s acceptable to this President.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re still midstream here in this process, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to offer any detailed assessments of the product.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The deal on the omnibus takes away funding from the Department of Energy for the provision that would essentially eliminate -- effectively ban old, incandescent light bulbs.\xc2\xa0 Senator Barbara Boxer has called this a poison pill.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, first of all, if you share her concern.\xc2\xa0 I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to draw any lines because it\xe2\x80\x99s a fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 But do you share her concern?\xc2\xa0 And since the President has talked so much in the past about the new light bulbs, how significant a step backwards is this from the perspective of the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve supported, this removal of this provision.\xc2\xa0 But I would point out that it was something that was put into the law by the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to, again, get into specifics about what provisions are acceptable or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you not even have an opinion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t support that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not an opinion.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s -- I mean, the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a statement of fact.\xc2\xa0 Yes, we -- we think it\xe2\x80\x99s a --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President has expressed concern --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing to do, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make a statement about -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go through individual provisions of the omnibus or the payroll tax cut deal such as it is and say this is a deal-breaker and this isn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking for that.\xc2\xa0 How significant a step backwards would this be for energy efficiency considering the President has talked about this at length?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would -- for that assessment I would refer you to the Department of Energy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has talked about this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know he has, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an assessment of the impact it would have on energy efficiency.</p>\n<p>\n\tDan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 Jake, did you have another one?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the phone conversation the President had with President Medvedev, did they discuss at all some of the recent rhetoric by the Russian President on the missile defense system in Europe?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 The readout I gave you, which was pretty, I think, thorough, covered all the topics that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of that they discussed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, on the same day that the President was speaking to a Jewish organization -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw this ad that was put out in several national newspapers from the Emergency Committee for Israel -- and it raises the question, why does the Obama administration treat Israel like a punching bag?\xc2\xa0 Is the Obama administration treating Israel like a punching bag?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do you think the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking you the question.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the President\xe2\x80\x99s pretty extensive remarks just a short while ago on this administration\xe2\x80\x99s absolute, resolute, unshakable commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security; its unprecedented support for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, through a variety of means.\xc2\xa0 And that assessment is not just one that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made, but one that Prime Minister Netanyahu has made and others in the current Israeli government, as well as others who are considered respectable voices within Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I would simply reiterate that this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security is unshakable.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s this administration\xe2\x80\x99s policy, and it has been demonstrated I think amply by the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken in the last nearly three years in regard to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why, then, do you think there is still this skepticism, and something like this, where --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- again, I confess that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who put it out.\xc2\xa0 But the idea that somebody out there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with everything this President does is not a new one, on a host of issues.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s true for every President.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- the fact that I disagree with the opinion expressed there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that folks might have an opinion that differs from mine or the President\xe2\x80\x99s, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that they have the right to express it.\xc2\xa0 What I know is what this President\xe2\x80\x99s record is, and it is exceptionally strong.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady is going to be leaving in a few hours for Hawaii.\xc2\xa0 Obviously she isn\xe2\x80\x99t able to go with the President.\xc2\xa0 But I wanted to ask, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it quite an extravagance -- four people to go in two jets to Hawaii -- particularly given the state of the economy, the state of the budget, and also given the directive that was just put out about limiting air travel by the administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Two things, Mike.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I think you ought to check your sourcing on that.\xc2\xa0 I think the original story was an interesting one.\xc2\xa0 But the First Lady and their daughters --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- another story, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The First Lady and their daughters will be traveling today, as originally planned, for their annual holiday trip to visit their family in the President\xe2\x80\x99s home state of Hawaii.\xc2\xa0 As previous First Ladies have done, they will travel on a military aircraft.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they wait, everybody go on one -- so there\xe2\x80\x99s one jet instead of two.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it was that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, Air Force One is $185,000 an hour to operate, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a long flight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, as previous First Ladies have done, they will travel on a military aircraft.\xc2\xa0 As previous First Ladies have done, they will travel separate from the President on a -- and that has been a practice in previous administrations.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President has made clear for a long time now that he will stay to ensure that Congress gets its work done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he not leaving tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s see what happens in Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Senate is going to be in session.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a scheduling announcement to make, but I think you\xe2\x80\x99re effectively putting two and two together there.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that at all as a -- but I think it stands to reason that if --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m available for work on the budget team.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If the -- the President is remaining in Washington to ensure that the American people -- 160 million Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes raised on January 1st.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, Norah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could try one more time on Keystone --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Certainly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- given what Ben has already outlined and the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 insistence on the Hill -- is there a compromise here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, they say there is, and we hope there is.\xc2\xa0 In the holiday spirit, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to cautiously assess that there is a compromise available here.\xc2\xa0 One obvious --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If language on Keystone is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 One obvious avenue here, if the desire is to give 160 million middle-class Americans a tax cut and not to play politics, then you just craft a bill that focuses on the tax cut.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or at least an accelerated timeline on Keystone?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that has nothing to do with the tax cut.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, if what\xe2\x80\x99s really -- what folks are concerned about most on the Hill is that middle-class Americans who are struggling every day to make ends meet don\xe2\x80\x99t see their taxes go up on January 1st because of congressional inaction, then they should just move a payroll tax cut bill that everybody can agree on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, politics has clearly infected this process.\xc2\xa0 As I noted, the fervor that used to animate Republicans when it came to tax cuts was absent in this process.\xc2\xa0 Although it was present when it came to defending the tax benefits and tax rates of millionaires and billionaires, it was absent when it came to middle-class folks and those struggling to get into the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s been a little more interest lately expressed by Republicans in extending the payroll tax cut, and increasingly, day by day, a commitment to do that.\xc2\xa0 That is a good thing.\xc2\xa0 That is a sign that the debate has moved in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 That politics is still a part of this, I concede.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, we will reach a compromise that everybody can live with.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you talked about politics being injected -- I spoke with a senior Democratic leader in Congress, who said that the White House and Senator Reid had engaged in politics by injecting the idea of a shutdown on the omnibus bill was ultimately a distraction from what this Democratic member said was a winning argument on the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 Is there a regret here in the White House that that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This Democratic member said that anonymously, I guess?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking.\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- you\xe2\x80\x99re not just saying that for --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They would say it anonymously, sure, yes, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to publicly criticize the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s approach through this process has been focused on the -- what he believes is the absolute necessity of extending the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been his policy focus.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been his strategic focus.\xc2\xa0 Everything he\xe2\x80\x99s done has been designed to ensure or to make more likely that Congress will actually do the thing it should do here, which is help the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he certainly -- we make no apology for that approach.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s the right approach.\xc2\xa0 We think that the American people if, come New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, they wake up not just with -- some of them -- a hangover but with the realization that they have a tax hike on the horizon, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll want to know what the heck Congress was up to and why it didn\xe2\x80\x99t get this simple business done.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, let me go back to the start, which is to say that we are --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think people are going to -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- we are hopeful, and we take as encouraging some of the indications from the Hill that there is an effort underway -- well, we know there\xe2\x80\x99s an effort underway, and we take as encouraging the assessments by some on the Hill that this can get done.\xc2\xa0 We certainly hope it will.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then finally, can I just ask you about some of the attacks that were leveled at the President last night in a Republican debate, specifically Mitt Romney who said that he has the experience running business and learned from their successes and failures, and \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have credibility on the economy when he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a President, someone who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand how the economy works.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, all I know is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s record is what it is, and that the folks who are contending for the opportunity to run against him all espouse a policy philosophy when it comes to economics that is virtually identical to the policy philosophy that got us into this mess.\xc2\xa0 So we look forward to that debate, and that includes all the leading and not leading contenders in terms of the proposals that they\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward, the positions that they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken are -- they echo perfectly the positions and proposals that were unfortunately adopted that led to the worst economic crisis anyone of us has seen.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are any folks old enough here to have lived through the Great Depression, so this is the worst we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, it\xe2\x80\x99s the worst we\xe2\x80\x99ll ever see because this President is going to get reelected, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to pursue policies that build up the middle class, that grow the economy, and that build the economic foundation that is essential for this country to win the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following on Norah\xe2\x80\x99s question about Democrats, there are some on the record not being that harsh, but Senator Begich of Alaska, for example, saying I think it was today that he thinks the President is wrong on Keystone and that -- in his words -- \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to delay the decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tI think Mark Smith will back up my math here that if you have -- I think there are eight Senate Democrats -- Landrieu, others, who if you add that up with 48 Senate Republicans about, are pretty close to 60 to break a filibuster in terms of a bipartisan group in the Senate that are saying you should move forward on the pipeline.\xc2\xa0 So unlike other issues where Republicans have picked off, say, one Democrat, and you guys have said, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s really not a bipartisan effort, it does seem like it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly bipartisan, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it, when you have about eight Senate Democrats saying move forward?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo how does the President approach this when he has a significant number of his fellow Democrats saying move forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question, Ed.\xc2\xa0 The President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stated a position on whether or not the Keystone pipeline should be granted a permit or not -- I messed up my English -- whether or not the Keystone permit should be granted.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat he has said is that there are criteria that must be considered.\xc2\xa0 The process is run by the State Department in accordance with a long -- decades-long tradition, appropriately, because of the international nature of the project.\xc2\xa0 Because of the opposition in part of Republicans and the Republican governor in Nebraska, there was a decision made in that review process to look for an alternate route, and that has necessarily expanded the duration of the process, the review process, because you can\xe2\x80\x99t approve something before you have something to review, as I understand it, not being a scientist.\xc2\xa0 But I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty reasonable approach to take.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President simply -- this is a process run by the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Because of the concerns, the legitimate concerns about the aquifer in Nebraska, there is now a process which will lead to the designation of an alternate route or alternate routes.\xc2\xa0 That process needs -- that needs to be reviewed because public health has to be taken into consideration.\xc2\xa0 All the other impacts that this kind of thing can have need to be taken into consideration, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why, as I understand it -- and I refer you to the State Department -- the duration of that process was identified.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, again, the President is not making a judgment on whether the permit should or should not be granted once that process is completed.\xc2\xa0 That process is housed in the State Department.\xc2\xa0 The State Department, if that process is allowed to take place, will make its recommendation once that review is done.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be is short-circuited because folks think it ought to be, because that\xe2\x80\x99s just not how it should work because this is the kind of thing, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not unprecedented, that has -- there are a lot of factors here, a lot of impacts in terms of jobs and energy security, the environment and public health that have to be considered and weighed.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what that review process is all about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a Republican senator, Orrin Hatch -- please don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot the messenger -- but he today called -- he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe real is issue is the President is a scaredy cat.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And it was his words, not mine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s suggesting that -- again, it\xe2\x80\x99s been said before -- you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to kick this past the election.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply note to the senator that one of the most prominent voices expressing concern about the original proposed route was the Republican governor of Nebraska.\xc2\xa0 His concerns were valid, as were the concerns of others, again, based on the assessment by the State Department, which is why the process was expanded, or the duration of the process was expanded.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s how it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 Quick follow-up on the First Lady.\xc2\xa0 She had a Marine Corps \xe2\x80\x9cToys for Tots\xe2\x80\x9d event today and a 20-year-old Marine asked her to be his date at the Marine Corps Ball next year.\xc2\xa0 And he claims --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is that right?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that she said she would love to do it, but had to check with her husband.\xc2\xa0 Has the President -- (laughter) --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hey, if the President is watching this, this might be the first he\xe2\x80\x99s heard of it.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I apologize.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to cause -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President watches --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can shoot the messenger.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xc2\xa0 He always watches.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that under review at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to military families is very strong indeed.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she was flattered by the invitation.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Ron Wyden has said that critics of his new bill, the Wyden-Ryan plan, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t read the bill, and that seniors will still be able to stay on Medicare, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s just injecting some competition for private insurance companies.\xc2\xa0 So what is your reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 Does the President really understand the plan, the proposal?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with competition for Medicare?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve read the bill.\xc2\xa0 And you saw what I said yesterday and heard what I said yesterday, and our assessment of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are for strengthening Medicare.\xc2\xa0 The proposals the President has put forward, both through the Affordable Care Act and the proposals he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward this year in his budget and his long-term deficit and debt reduction plan include savings in Medicare that are designed to strengthen Medicare so it is there for seniors in the future.\xc2\xa0 And we are always open to ideas -- to new ideas, to different ideas, ideas that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t come up with but other smart people have, that strengthen Medicare.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we don\xe2\x80\x99t think is the right approach are ideas that weaken Medicare; that create an uneven playing field, if you will, that in our analysis of this proposal -- which was in a brochure form of about eight pages, so it was pretty easy to read, pretty quick reading -- would not strengthen the program but would weaken it, would weaken Medicare unnecessarily.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why we took the position we took.\xc2\xa0 Not because we\xe2\x80\x99re against ideas that don\xe2\x80\x99t originate in the White House, but because we are focused on those ideas that will strengthen Medicare, which has been an enormously successful program that has aided millions and millions of seniors since it was created, and needs to be there for seniors in the future.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the foundation of our approach.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any plan to work with Wyden on developing some kind of compromise?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we will work with folks in Congress next year and the years after who have ideas that can strengthen not just that program but others.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any plans right now that -- we\xe2\x80\x99re kind of focused on this endgame for the end of the year right now, these other issues.\xc2\xa0 But again, we\xe2\x80\x99re open to ideas that we think can strengthen Medicare, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to do the kind of radical surgery on the program that essentially ends it as we know it, and that makes it prohibitively expensive for millions of seniors who then have no choice but to go into plans that don\xe2\x80\x99t offer them the kind of services that they need.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s -- the focus here is on strengthening Medicare.</p>\n<p>\n\tKate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything other than getting the payroll tax cut through that the White House is pushing for as strongly as Republicans are pushing for Keystone to be in it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Unemployment insurance extension.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are various -- this gets into acronyms and that kind of stuff, but there are things that need to be done, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re a part of the payroll tax cut bill or not.\xc2\xa0 But the \xe2\x80\x9cdoc fix,\xe2\x80\x9d as you know, needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s essential, we believe, as part of the payroll tax cut, is the unemployment insurance extension.\xc2\xa0 And folks have talked about SGR being part of it, and other things.\xc2\xa0 But those are things that have to get done before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut that\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President\xe2\x80\x99s priority is not letting Congress leave town having ensured that Americans will have their taxes go up in 15 days.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re very hopeful that members of Congress of both parties, both houses, will prevent that from happening.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But because it\xe2\x80\x99s a negotiation, what are you willing to negotiate on?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we have been very willing, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said from the beginning, to negotiate on pay-fors that are acceptable.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very willing to negotiate on a variety of things.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say, why is there horse-trading here if Republicans are actually for giving middle-class Americans a tax cut?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not doing the President a favor by giving middle-class Americans a tax cut.\xc2\xa0 And by being so lukewarm, and in some cases opposing middle-class tax cut, they\xe2\x80\x99re not doing the American people a favor.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis needs to get done.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing that has traditionally had bipartisan support; it\xe2\x80\x99s traditionally had strong Republican support.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that, because of that and because of the, I think, unwelcome response that members of Congress would get if they don\xe2\x80\x99t get this done, that they\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out a way to do it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another issue.\xc2\xa0 Republican senators, including Lindsey Graham and John McCain, just sent out a release saying that the release of this Lebanese terrorist, Ali Mussa Daqduq, to the Iraqi government, \xe2\x80\x9csends exactly the wrong message to our allies and enemies in the region.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 Because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about the crimes of Daqduq, Mr. Daqduq, that he is alleged to have committed, we worked a wide range of options consistent with U.S. and Iraqi law to effect Daqduq\xe2\x80\x99s transfer to a U.S. military commission.\xc2\xa0 We did so because we felt that was the fastest possible way to bring him to justice.\xc2\xa0 We are continuing to discuss this with the Iraqis, and, as of this morning, he has been transferred to Iraqi custody, as you note.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe take this case extremely seriously, and for that reason have sought and received assurances that he will be tried for his crimes.\xc2\xa0 We have worked this at the highest levels of the U.S. and Iraqi governments, and we continue to discuss with the Iraqis the best way to ensure that he faces justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tGlenn.\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Kristen, I owe you one.\xc2\xa0 Then Glenn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Just following up on that.\xc2\xa0 Your last sentence, \xe2\x80\x9cwe continue to discuss with Iraqis the best way to ensure that he,\xe2\x80\x9d Daqduq, \xe2\x80\x9cfaces justice\xe2\x80\x9d -- can you go into a little bit more detail about what some of those ways are, and how confident the administration is that he will in fact face justice?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not really, to be honest with you.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that those conversations are continuing; that we are -- we obviously have our -- we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing here with a sovereign Iraq, and we have our -- the handling of this case has been in accordance with both U.S. and Iraqi law.\xc2\xa0 And we are continuing to discuss the matter, and we have received assurances, as I said, that he will be tried for his crimes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the big concerns that\xe2\x80\x99s been raised is that he could potentially be handed over to Iran.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the administration that that might happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been assured at the highest levels that he will be tried for his crimes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And some of the family members -- at least one -- was quoted in The New York Times as saying this decision is basically synonymous with letting him go free, because so many former people in this similar situation have gone free.\xc2\xa0 What would you say to those family members?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s message to them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that we take this matter extremely seriously, which is why we have worked on it at all levels, including the highest levels, and why we are continuing to work on it in accordance with both U.S. and Iraqi law, and why we sought and received the assurances that we have received.\xc2\xa0 We take it very seriously.\xc2\xa0 We understand those concerns, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have these discussions and work this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more about the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 One of the ideas that had been discussed earlier today was a possible short-term extension.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the President would agree to, a stopgap measure?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into negotiating from here.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s priority is that Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up on January 1st.\xc2\xa0 Our preference, obviously, is for a proposal to mirror what the President put forward back in September in the American Jobs Act, which is for a full-year extension of the payroll tax cut, and in the case of his proposal, an extension and expansion.\xc2\xa0 At the minimum, we need an extension here so that Americans get that $1,000, on average, tax cut in 2012 rather than have the $1,000, on average, tax hike.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Glenn, I think I owe you -- yes, and then Alexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions:\xc2\xa0 one Keystone, one payroll tax.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s former National Security Advisor, Jim Jones, today did a call sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute in which he said that he thought the -- delaying the Keystone would \xe2\x80\x9cbe a threat to\xe2\x80\x9d -- sort of -- \xe2\x80\x9cnational economic security,\xe2\x80\x9d and would constitute a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant setback.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that assessment?\xc2\xa0 And were you guys surprised that the former National Security Advisor would --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard of that report, Glenn.\xc2\xa0 I mean, our position on this is clear.\xc2\xa0 The route was changed because of concern expressed by a variety of folks, including the Republican governor of Nebraska, that then required the State Department, which runs this process, to begin a new review to look for alternate routes.\xc2\xa0 That needs to take place.\xc2\xa0 It would be wrong to do it otherwise because of the important issues at stake here, including public health, the environment, the economy, economic security, energy security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would point out, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say before, that the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach on energy security is very broad-based.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an all-of-the-above approach.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s expanded drilling and the search for oil and gas.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he has pursued aggressively clean energy technology -- and, I would say, expanding that and making sure it happens in a responsible and safe way in the wake of the Gulf oil spill.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as regards Keystone, there\xe2\x80\x99s a process here that\xe2\x80\x99s important for something of this nature and magnitude, and that process has to run its course.\xc2\xa0 And this is not about making a judgment about whether, in the end, a permit should be approved or denied; it\xe2\x80\x99s about making sure that the process is thorough so that the decision, when it is made, is made based on all the best information available.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis -- and then Chris, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick follow-up on the payroll tax.\xc2\xa0 You guys were talking very passionately and very consistently over the past month about the need for tax equity, and the need to make the wealthy pay their fair share.\xc2\xa0 It seems like that conversation has really stopped in the last 48 hours.\xc2\xa0 You guys are talking about a deal --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why should the American people believe that you folks are really committed to that?\xc2\xa0 And what would be the path forward to seeing that tax equity if not this particular process over the payroll?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was discussing this yesterday, I believe.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is clear from the American Jobs Act; it has been clear since he\xe2\x80\x99s been a candidate; it is clear today, and it will be the same after today and throughout his presidency.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith regards to the payroll tax cut measure and the other elements of the American Jobs Act that Republicans blocked, yes, we have a situation where Republicans made it clear that rather than put 400,000 teachers back in the classroom, rather than fund infrastructure and put construction workers back to work, rather than give 1.6 million [sic] Americans a tax cut, they protected the -- in the case of the broader American Jobs Act, the loopholes and benefits and tax prerogatives of the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 In the case of the Senate Democratic versions here, they refuse to give a tax cut to 160 million Americans because they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask 300,000 millionaires and billionaires to pay a little bit more.\xc2\xa0 We won\xe2\x80\x99t stop talking about that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of simple balance and fairness.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also the case that we have to get this payroll tax cut done or else middle-class Americans, working Americans, are going to have a tax hike on January 1st, at a time when we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to continue to recover from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that that will get done.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the President\xe2\x80\x99s overall position on the balanced approach we need to take in our economic policy, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s with regards to measures that are designed to help the economy grow and create jobs, or measures that reduce the deficit and debt.\xc2\xa0 Everybody should be in this together.\xc2\xa0 The burden should not be borne by seniors or folks with disabilities or the folks who can bear it least.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you start talking about spending bills early next year, are you going to make -- granted that the payroll tax cut is tied to this now -- but when it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, early next year, when you\xe2\x80\x99re presumably dealing with other spending measures, are you guys planning to make increasing taxes on the top end a precondition to some of those discussions?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense as to where --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any spending measures that will be coming up in January, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, if the spending -- if the omnibus is completed.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that the broader debate here will certainly continue.\xc2\xa0 That I can guarantee.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, let me follow on what Glenn was asking you.\xc2\xa0 This has been an interesting year -- this is a reflective question -- this has been an interesting year of divided government for the President.\xc2\xa0 He has expressed many times over the year his frustration in dealing with what you just called \xe2\x80\x9cthe worst Congress in history.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that\xe2\x80\x99s what many, many Americans -- more than 40 percent -- are calling it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m hopeful that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to change and not be the worst.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So before -- as the year limps to a close, this year of divided government, I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in asking -- the President has tried various techniques this year.\xc2\xa0 What would he say he learned about dealing with divided government this year?\xc2\xa0 And what might he say worked that he wants to carry into the next year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity -- you and the press will have an opportunity to ask him that question at some point.\xc2\xa0 So without being too specific, I\xe2\x80\x99d say that he has and will continue to try all approaches that he thinks have a chance of succeeding when it comes to implementing the economic policies and other policies that will benefit the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe economy and jobs is his principal focus, but that holds true for other areas, too.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not wedded to a strategy here.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s wedded to getting results that help the American people.\xc2\xa0 He is committed, in the case of the current debate, to getting a payroll tax cut done so that Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up.\xc2\xa0 But if it does get done, our work will not be done.\xc2\xa0 There will still not be the kind of economy that we need to build in this country, that economic growth will not be fast enough, unemployment will still be too high.\xc2\xa0 So he will continue to push proposals that grow the economy, that help it create jobs, and he will continue to push proposals that are balanced that deal with our deficits and debt.\xc2\xa0 And the means by which he does that working with a divided government, working with a divided Congress, are less important than results.\xc2\xa0 And so he\xe2\x80\x99s agnostic on that, I believe, because the focus is helping Americans deal with their everyday problems:\xc2\xa0 their bills and their jobs and their economic security, their health care.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any chance for a week ahead, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is today Friday?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got one because we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that at some point we\xe2\x80\x99ll get done and you all will get out of here.\xc2\xa0 Take care.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t4:04 P.M.
