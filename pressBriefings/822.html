PDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 It\'s Jay Carney and Jen Psaki live from some resort outside of Las Vegas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Westin Lake Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Westin Lake Las Vegas.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for joining us. I just wanted, at the start here, to bring attention to a report earlier today about the plummet in the value of Iran\'s currency. And that situation is a direct result of the choices made by Iranian leaders.\xc2\xa0 Due to their poor choices and economic mismanagement, Iran\'s economy is under unprecedented pressure.</p>\n<p>From the outset, our policy has been to sharpen the choice for Iran\'s leaders.\xc2\xa0 Iran can meet its international obligations regarding its nuclear program and rejoin the community of nations, or it will face increasing pressure and isolation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\'s the only thing I wanted to mention at the top.\xc2\xa0 Jen might have something.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Two quick things, which you\'ve seen reported, but just so everybody -- I\'ll highlight it for you.\xc2\xa0 One is last night the campaign reached our 10 millionth donation this year, which is obviously a huge milestone, historic record for grassroots politics and really emphasizes the fact that our campaign is being driven by low-dollar, grassroots donations.</p>\n<p>And the second piece -- and you should all have this in your inbox and some of you have already written about it, but we have a new TV ad out today, "Since When," which highlights Mitt Romney\'s longstanding commitment to outsourcing.\xc2\xa0 When Mitt Romney led Bain Capital, they invested in a Chinese company called Global-Tech, which relied on American outsourcing for its success.\xc2\xa0 Even though Global-Tech promoted its practices of exploiting low-wage labor, Romney and Bain saw Global-Tech as a good investment.\xc2\xa0 So now when Mitt Romney tries to talk tough on China it\'s just embarrassing.\xc2\xa0 The American people know that trusting Romney to hold China accountable is like asking a fox to guard the hen house -- you may have heard that line before by someone who\'s a bigger bill than me.</p>\n<p>It\'s running in seven states including Nevada where we are today.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And with that, we\'ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, even though I\'ve lowered my own expectations for your answer to this question, any update on debate prep?\xc2\xa0 The President seemed to be bemoaning all the time he\'s having to spend inside when we were at the OFA office earlier.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Debate prep is occurring inside -- I can confirm that.\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday and as we\'ve been saying, the President will obviously spend a bit of time in advance of Wednesday preparing for the debate with his team.\xc2\xa0 He believes that during this time one of the main focuses is to make sure he\'s sharpening his answers and shortening the time it takes to make them, but also remembering that his goal on Wednesday evening is to speak directly to the American people, to build on what he did at the convention and what he\'s been doing for months in laying out the choice for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s who his audience will be on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>I will highlight that we\'ve seen in reports again this morning that Mitt Romney and his team have continued to lay it on that this is, they expect, a game-changing performance on Wednesday, and that\'s what they\'re working toward.\xc2\xa0 I know one of the other pieces I think the American people -- we think the American people are looking for is specifics, and Mitt Romney and his team, including his running mate, and many of his surrogates have had ample opportunity to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This week hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the greatest week for that, on that front.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday his running mate, Paul Ryan, refused to provide specifics about how they\'ll pay for their $5 trillion tax plan, claiming that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the time to do it.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how much time he has, the math doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add up, as we know. And today -- I don\'t know if you all saw -- but Governor McDonnell was on MSNBC and was asked about the specifics and whether we could expect more specifics, and his answer was that that was a laughable question.</p>\n<p>So that seems to be the message coming from there.\xc2\xa0 We know the American people are looking for more and we hope to hear more on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You all said repeatedly that the President has spent less time -- or that Mitt Romney has spent more time preparing than any candidate in modern history.\xc2\xa0 So don\'t you have a comparison idea -- how many hours has the President spent, so we can sort of actually compare that to what we know that the Romney campaign has told us about what Romney has done?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Romney team has been clear, and I know you have these stats, but that he started preparing in July, that he\'s spent some periods of 48 hours doing five mock debates, that he has taken weeks off to spend preparing for the debate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We appreciate the opportunity -- we\'re not going to lay out the hours or specifics of what the President has done preparing for Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he\'s here this period of time.\xc2\xa0 He has had to cut down because of events overseas and has had to change and cancel some of the scheduled preps over the last couple of weeks because of that and because of his busy campaign schedule. But we just don\'t have any plans to lay out specific hours or anything like that.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll leave that to our opponent\'s team to lay out for you.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would add that there were a lot of football games on yesterday.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 There were.\xc2\xa0 There was a lot of sports watching on the plane.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of how the sessions are going and any color from the room, like who\'s in there with him, how many -- how much of the staff that are here are here to help him prepare, as opposed to do other things?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I apologize, because I know this is -- we\xe2\x80\x99re all going to bang our heads against the wall here for the next 48 hours, but obviously he has close policy and political advisors working with him.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to lay out how it\xe2\x80\x99s going or what\xe2\x80\x99s happening, because obviously our focus is on making sure he has what he needs in advance of Wednesday, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t see any reason to lay those specifics out for our opponent.</p>\n<p>Obviously, as you know, he just went and took a break, and went to a local campaign office to rally and excite volunteers and our campaign staff, because at the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on early vote and we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on getting people out to vote as soon as they have the opportunity to.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a balance we\xe2\x80\x99re striking here as well while we\xe2\x80\x99re in Nevada.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question for both of you.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reaction to Governor Romney\xe2\x80\x99s op-ed in The Wall Street Journal today about Obama\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy record?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just start by addressing the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy record.\xc2\xa0 When President Obama took office, the Iraq war had been going on for years and he had campaigned with a promised to end that war, and he has done that. He promised during the campaign to focus attention on Afghanistan and on al Qaeda in the AfPak region, because that attention was lacking in the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 He inherited the policy in Afghanistan that was widely described as a drift with no clear focus and no suitable resources -- or a lack of suitable resources to execute the mission.\xc2\xa0 He kept his promise to refocus the mission in Afghanistan to take a fight to al Qaeda in the AfPak region as well as around the world, and I think you know the results of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He promised to strengthened our alliances that had been frayed, and to restore America\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the world.\xc2\xa0 He has done both of those things.</p>\n<p>He made clear his belief that because of the focus on Iraq in particular and the Middle East more broadly, the rise of the Pacific Rim, especially China and other nations, have been neglected during the previous administration, and he promised to rebalance America\xe2\x80\x99s interest towards the Pacific Rim, and he has done that.</p>\n<p>This is a record that is very strong and is in keeping with the promises he made in 2008.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just add that reading that op-ed, it was -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no op-ed or no speech -- which we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard he may or may not give at some point in the next few weeks -- that\xe2\x80\x99s going to change the view of the American people that he has been reckless, erratic, and irresponsible on foreign policy issues every time he\xe2\x80\x99s had the opportunity to speak to them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There was a lot of chest-pumping rhetoric in there.\xc2\xa0 There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of specifics in that op-ed and how he wanted to go about leading the world, how he would do things differently.\xc2\xa0 And we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people are looking for.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If you look at his record -- which, obviously, Wednesday will be a domestic policy debate, but there will be plenty of time to discuss these issues -- he has opposed ending the war in Iraq, unlike the President\xe2\x80\x99s position and President\xe2\x80\x99s record on that, saying that he would have kept as many 30,000 troops there indefinitely.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s had an incoherent record and vision on al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 He said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go after Osama bin Laden inside Pakistan if we had him in our sights, and that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth moving heaven and Earth to catch him.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we disagree with that.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s had some incoherent positions when it comes to Iran, saying he would move America in a different direction, but all of his ideas are things President Obama is already doing.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more to prove, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that op-ed accomplished anything in terms of affirming the confidence of the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you address maybe some of his specific criticisms<br/>\n\t-- too timid in response to the Syrian civil war, the election of the Islamist President in Egypt, the attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, the threat of Iran getting a nuclear weapon?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say broadly that on all of the issues, the criticism reflected in that op-ed contains no specifics for an alternative.\xc2\xa0 What we know about, in this case Governor Romney\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy, is that on the very -- the areas that you mentioned, his actual proposals -- if he has any<br/>\n\t-- are no different from what the President is actually doing, with the exception perhaps of Iran, where short of the most intensive sanctions regime ever put into place, the most intensive diplomatic isolation that Iran has ever been under, coupled with pursuit for a diplomatic solution to the problem, the alternative is war.\xc2\xa0 And as the President has said, if Governor Romney or other critics are advocating that as a position, they ought to say so clearly.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I just want to add one other thing on the debate, to make sure you saw it.\xc2\xa0 And we put this out over the weekend, but I know there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of paper floating around. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reports that Governor Romney is going to talk about his record in Massachusetts, his record at Bain during the debate.\xc2\xa0 And in advance of Wednesday, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have several Massachusetts officials out in key swing states across the country laying out the facts about his record.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s just one other piece to look out for.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 One other issue, because it was raised in that op-ed is -- and it broadly goes to the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy record and so I\xe2\x80\x99d like to address it, which is on the issue of the U.S.-Israeli relationship, what critics cannot contest is that President Obama and his administration have established the strongest relationship with Israel when it comes to helping protect Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security that has ever existed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that has been attested to by Israeli leaders, not just by members of the administration.\xc2\xa0 And there is an unshakeable commitment that this President has made clear, he feels, of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 support behind Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys have downplayed the idea that zingers would be a big part of his debate MO, but presumably there are some.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to get on record, are you ruling out any zingers or are you just saying that they won\xe2\x80\x99t be a big part of it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there\xe2\x80\x99s a draped basketball court out back.\xc2\xa0 Has he had a chance to get out there, and will he while we\xe2\x80\x99re here?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of him playing basketball.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any prediction of if he will or won\xe2\x80\x99t, but not aware of any plans.</p>\n<p>On zingers, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say the reason why this is such an important point is that Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s team has previewed that he\xe2\x80\x99s been working on one-liners and zingers for months -- as if that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people are looking for, and as if that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re waiting to hear from him.\xc2\xa0 He laid out his plans in his speech at the Republican Convention.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, the American people didn\xe2\x80\x99t like what he had to say about everything from his plans to extend tax cuts to the highest income and leave the burden on the back of the middle class, to voucherize Medicare, to make dramatic cuts to programs like Pell grants.\xc2\xa0 And he has the opportunity to speak to that.</p>\n<p>Obviously, there are always moments in debates that we\xe2\x80\x99ll all remember.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to predict what those will be right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Especially without knowing what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing inside that room.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have to say we could invite you guys in to participate in the prep session, and play moderator and play John Kerry, but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem -- or play Mitt Romney -- but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like that was the best strategic choice for us to make as we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get the President prepared and make sure he has what he needs.\xc2\xa0 We do love transparency, as you know.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If I could just add -- I think you know, having covered him, and all of us having observed him -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s inclination and preference when policy is being debated is to debate it substantively and discuss it substantively, and to explain and put forward his ideas for why he thinks -- or what he thinks is the best way to move this country forward, both domestically and internationally.\xc2\xa0 And that preference and inclination, given modern debate format, might be a liability, but it is the approach he prefers to take.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So who\xe2\x80\x99s winning the mock debates?\xc2\xa0 Has Kerry won one yet?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t read that sort of thing out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question is has he lost one yet.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you drive around this area, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty striking to see a lot of the homes that are empty and the golf courses that are abandoned.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President has had any reaction to kind of the pretty obvious state of the economy in this area as he\xe2\x80\x99s driven in and out.</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to that specifically.\xc2\xa0 I just haven\xe2\x80\x99t been riding in the car with him back and forth from here. Obviously, one of the issues -- and you touched on this -- that has impacted this state dramatically is the housing crisis.\xc2\xa0 And this is an area where of course -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen prices go up a little bit, not enough.\xc2\xa0 This is an area, as is evidenced by the President\xe2\x80\x99s weekly address he gave just two days ago, that he\xe2\x80\x99s remained focused on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s a huge difference between the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans here and Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s plans.\xc2\xa0 He put out -- Mitt Romney put out a policy a couple of weeks ago on housing, which he thought so highly of he did it on a Friday afternoon after he released his taxes -- and that always tells you something -- you guys are all reporters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the President is -- every time he comes to a place like Nevada and he speaks with the people in this state, he\xe2\x80\x99s very cognizant of the challenges they\xe2\x80\x99re going through.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why he\xe2\x80\x99s proposed to expand his housing policy that, a year ago -- and this is just a little housing refresher, but it\xe2\x80\x99s relevant here -- a little over a year ago he proposed a policy to make it so that homeowners who were underwater could -- that government -- that people who are underwater and had government-backed mortgages would be able to refinance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It worked so well that it\xe2\x80\x99s contributed to many, many more people being able to refinance.\xc2\xa0 But there are many people in Nevada who don\xe2\x80\x99t have government-backed mortgages, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a policy -- as you know, because he talked about it Saturday -- that he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of.</p>\n<p>So the short answer is, when he goes to events like he did last night, when he talks to the field staffers he did today, these are conversations and these are interactions that impact him deeply and he talks about frequently.</p>\n<p>And the last thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is, one of the stories he tells often in interviews and even when he\xe2\x80\x99s just chatting about the challenges we\xe2\x80\x99re facing, is a group of teachers he met in Nevada the last time he was here who talked about class sizes.\xc2\xa0 So as much as he\xe2\x80\x99s not talking to people as he\xe2\x80\x99s driving along, that\xe2\x80\x99s part of these visits and part of why we wanted to come here and do debate prep here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s part of the reason?</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 That he has the opportunity to speak directly to the people of this state, have conversations with the field staffers and the volunteers and the organizers, and people along the rope line like he did last night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We saw the cyber-attack information from a background source.\xc2\xa0 But --\xc2\xa0 (laughter) --</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Never heard of that guy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You never heard of that guy.\xc2\xa0 However, one newspaper reported that the cyber-attack was specifically on the White House Military Office, which supposedly controls the nuclear launch codes.\xc2\xa0 Any response to that specifically?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The attack you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned was what\xe2\x80\x99s known as a spear-phishing attack against an unclassified network.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear -- this is an unclassified network.\xc2\xa0 These types of attacks are not infrequent, and we have mitigation measures in place.\xc2\xa0 In this instance, the attack was identified, the system was isolated, and there is no indication whatsoever that any exfiltration of data took place.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, there was never any impact or attempted breach of any classified system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what does the network control if it\xe2\x80\x99s unclassified?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If that network is unclassified, then what does it control?\xc2\xa0 What is it in charge of?\xc2\xa0 What information is stored in that network?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics about classified and unclassified networks, except that there are distinctions between those networks that have -- contain classified information and those that don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And the attack was against an unclassified network.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you give us any sense of how the President is keeping updated on the investigation in Libya?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific beyond his regular presidential daily briefings on foreign policy, national security conversations.\xc2\xa0 I have nothing new for you on the attack on the diplomatic facility in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 He has made clear that he wants the perpetrators to be brought to justice.\xc2\xa0 And he wants the FBI investigation as well as the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s security review to proceed and lead wherever they may.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So any information he\xe2\x80\x99s getting, he\xe2\x80\x99s getting in that daily -- his daily briefing?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he certainly is getting his regular briefings, but he is -- he has national security staff with him all the time, and he also periodically checks in with Tom Donilon or Denis McDonough, other members of his national security team.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are either of them -- they\xe2\x80\x99re not here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Neither of those two are here, I believe.\xc2\xa0 Ben Rhodes is here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he still confident in how the investigations are going?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you on the investigations.\xc2\xa0 The FBI is leading an investigation on what happened, and Secretary Clinton has announced that there\xe2\x80\x99s a review -- a security review underway, and both are proceeding.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can ask about the -- part of the reason for the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit here to Nevada.\xc2\xa0 A couple of years ago, he made some statements about Las Vegas that a lot of people locally didn\xe2\x80\x99t take to and are actually being used against him in ads right now by Romney.\xc2\xa0 So was there any thinking of coming here, spending some time to try to ease that -- some of those feelings, some of those thoughts?\xc2\xa0 Or to show, hey, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m blowing some money in Vegas right now?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t read out what the staff is up to and other reporters.\xc2\xa0 But, look, the President has been here.\xc2\xa0 Those comments you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to were, I believe, more than three years ago.\xc2\xa0 Since that time, the President has been to Nevada and I believe Vegas about a dozen times.\xc2\xa0 This is a state that he absolutely enjoys coming to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He\xe2\x80\x99s here because we know that it is a very important swing state in our pursuit of winning 270 electoral votes.\xc2\xa0 And this is a place where he believes that his commitment to fighting for the middle class, his commitment to keeping at it and fighting to get the housing market up and running, his belief that we can get comprehensive immigration reform through, resonate with the people here.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why he\xe2\x80\x99s here.</p>\n<p>I think more than a comment from three years ago, that Mitt Romney and his team are trying to make something of that it\xe2\x80\x99s not, is the President\xe2\x80\x99s record.\xc2\xa0 And he has done a great deal to work on travel and tourism and promoting that in this country, because he knows that it is a major driver of economic growth in places like Las Vegas and many other cities around the country.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen great progress on that front, working with his Jobs Council and with his economic team.\xc2\xa0 We actually put out a progress report a couple of weeks ago that I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to get to you as well on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And his record really speaks to his commitment to that, more than attempts by an opponent during a political campaign to make something out of a comment that it clearly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t represent.</p>\n<p>Everybody good?\xc2\xa0 Do you want to talk more about mortgages?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Joking.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t3:44 P.M.
