Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t12:42 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0All right. \xc2\xa0Happy Friday, everybody. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have anything in addition to that at the top. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take whatever questions remain -- hopefully there aren\xe2\x80\x99t many.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Circling back to the campaign, Bernie Sanders is threatening a floor fight today at the Democratic Convention. \xc2\xa0He wants these committees that pick the platform to be made out of proportional numbers based on the results of these primaries. \xc2\xa0As the head of the Democratic Party, does the President have a view about whether that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair model that should be pursued?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, there are rules and regulations that sort of govern the conduct of the convention. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole apparatus at the Democratic National Committee that can follow the guidelines and ensure that our party hosts a convention that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the rules but also reflects the preferences of those who participated in primaries and caucuses across the country. \xc2\xa0And the President has got a lot of confidence in his DNC Chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to navigate this process and ensure that it concludes fairly and reflects the interests of Democrats across the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on that strike that we talked about yesterday in Syria that killed at least 28 people, both Russia and Syria are saying their aircraft were not responsible for this. \xc2\xa0I know you said yesterday you weren\xe2\x80\x99t aware of any U.S. or coalition aircraft in the area. \xc2\xa0Do you have any more recent intelligence about where that strike came from or who is responsible?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Josh, I can tell you that my colleagues both at the Department of Defense and in the intelligence community are continuing to look at this particular situation. \xc2\xa0As I noted yesterday, we\xe2\x80\x99re not in a position where we can draw clear conclusions about who exactly was responsible for this incident. What is true is that regardless of who was responsible, there is never any justification for carrying out a strike that targets innocent civilians, particularly innocent civilians that have already fled their homes to escape violence. \xc2\xa0And, unfortunately, there is a long track record of the Assad regime doing precisely that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to take a look at this particular incident around Idlib, and it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously an incident that we take quite seriously. \xc2\xa0But we take quite seriously the other incidents that we know have been perpetrated by the Assad regime against innocent civilians. \xc2\xa0And the bloodshed that we have seen inside Syria is astonishing and tragic. \xc2\xa0And too much of that blood is the blood of innocent civilians, and it\xe2\x80\x99s on the hands of Bashar al Assad and members of his government. \xc2\xa0And that is why we have made a strong case that Bashar al Assad needs to leave power and make room for the kind of political transition inside of Syria that\xe2\x80\x99s long overdue, so that a political leader inside of Syria can assume power and unify that country and bring an end to the chaos and the violence.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On that transition, the administration has set this August deadline for a political transition in Syria. \xc2\xa0What exactly is the U.S. threatening to do if that deadline is not met? \xc2\xa0And does the White House feel that the President has credibility behind any kind of threat, given his reluctance to strike a few years ago? \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any threats that have been issued. \xc2\xa0I think what Secretary Kerry and others have laid out is a framework for carrying out painstaking political talks. \xc2\xa0And those political talks have been undermined by the propensity of the Assad regime to carry out attacks against innocent civilians inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0Opposition leaders are understandably reluctant to come to the table with people who are, at the very same time, authorizing military assaults against their constituents.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen as much progress in these political talks as we would like to see. \xc2\xa0But the fact that the U.N. is even able to identify parties to the talks and has over the last several months been able to organize proximity talks is an indication that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made more progress than we have over the last five years. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re still a long way from the kind of political agreement that we need to see.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And President Erdogan is moving very quickly to try and consolidate power after the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s resignation. \xc2\xa0I was curious in how the U.S. feels about -- whether you have any concerns about that much power amassing in the Turkish presidency in light of some of your concerns about press freedom and the Kurds and other issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, obviously, as I mentioned yesterday, the United States and Turkey are NATO allies, and we have worked effectively with the Turks to expedite some elements of our counter-ISIL campaign. \xc2\xa0For example, Turkey has given the United States and other members of our coalition access to military facilities in Turkey that have made our military campaign even more effective against ISIL. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen Turkey make some progress in securing their border with Syria that has blunted the flow of weapons and foreign fighters across the border into Syria. \xc2\xa0Both of those things have been beneficial in our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat has not, however, prevented the United States or even the President of the United States from raising concerns about situations in which the Turkish government does not seem sufficiently committed to protecting the basic universal human rights of their people -- that, by the way, are enshrined in the Turkish constitution. \xc2\xa0These are rights that the United States advocates for around the world, and we do not hesitate in raising concerns even when those concerns involve the actions carried out by a government with whom the United States has an important alliance. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that will continue. \xc2\xa0Even as Turkey works through some of this -- through this political dispute and through this political turmoil, the United States is going to continue to stand by our ally; we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work effectively with them to carry out a military campaign against ISIL; and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to hesitate to publicly and privately encourage them to live up to the principles that are enshrined in the Turkish constitution.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJeff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, is the White House watching the congress in North Korea that Kim Jong-un opened today in which he talked about nuclear successes but also boosting economic development? \xc2\xa0Do you take that seriously? \xc2\xa0And what\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the administration is obviously aware of developments in North Korea and we watch them closely to the extent that those kinds of developments occur in public. \xc2\xa0That makes this situation a little unusual. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe obviously are aware of the risk that is posed by North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s effort to develop nuclear weapons and systems capable of delivering those nuclear weapons. \xc2\xa0The United States has worked effectively with the international community to counter those efforts, and as a result, North Korea has faced increasing isolation, which is saying something because they were pretty isolated at the end of last year and that trajectory has only gotten worse for them. \xc2\xa0And we know that it\xe2\x80\x99s had a negative impact on what is already a rather weak economy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur efforts have targeted those elements of the North Korean economy that we know benefit North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s weapons programs, and our concerns stem from the fact that those programs are inconsistent with their international obligations. \xc2\xa0And those aren\xe2\x80\x99t just concerns that the United States has raised; those are concerns that have also been raised by countries like China and Russia and South Korea and Japan. \xc2\xa0And the international community is serious about holding North Korea to account for their destabilizing and provocative behavior, and there is a path that North Korea can take to come out of the wilderness, to emerge from isolation, but it will require them renouncing nuclear weapons and demonstrating a clear commitment to ending their provocative actions and denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit. \xc2\xa0April.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I did ask the President about Howard and he chose not to answer. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I noticed. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about it tomorrow, though. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the good news, I guess.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you said you were going to give us information today. \xc2\xa0Are you going to not talk because the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I can try to give you a sense of what he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll try. \xc2\xa0I do think -- I looked this up before I came out here. \xc2\xa0This is actually the third time that the President has delivered a commencement address at an HBCU since entering the Oval Office. \xc2\xa0Back in 2010, the President gave the commencement address at Hampton University. \xc2\xa0And in 2013, the President delivered the commencement address at Morehouse College in Atlanta. \xc2\xa0So the President, in delivering the commencement address at Howard, will be delivering the commencement address at the third HBCU since taking office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will address a couple of themes. \xc2\xa0The first, the President will acknowledge the unique opportunity that these graduates have had to attend one of the finest HBCUs in the country. \xc2\xa0This means that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been exposed to passionate faculty members and a community of classmates that has nurtured their innate ability and empowered them with skills and experiences that can benefit our country. \xc2\xa0So this means that Howard students have been given a great gift, but they also are assuming an important responsibility. \xc2\xa0And I do expect that the President will touch on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will also observe that Howard graduates will be entering an economy and a society that\xe2\x80\x99s undergoing a series of profound changes. \xc2\xa0These changes aren\xe2\x80\x99t new in the sense that the changes didn\xe2\x80\x99t just start, but this is actually -- the class of 2016 has had a view of these changes throughout their lives. \xc2\xa0And how they use the skills that they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten in the course of this high-quality college education to confront the tremendous demographic, economic and technological changes that our country is experiencing right now is a question that each of those graduates will have to answer for themselves. \xc2\xa0The President is hopeful that they\xe2\x80\x99ll answer that question in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s good for the country and is consistent with the significant responsibility that they now have.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFinally, I think the last thing I\xe2\x80\x99d point out is, as somebody who has spent a decent portion of his professional career talking to young people and college graduates, the President enjoys the opportunity to give these kinds of speeches, but also to consider these issues that are on the minds of college graduates across the country. \xc2\xa0And obviously this speech that he\xe2\x80\x99s delivering tomorrow is an important one and an opportunity that he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to, but the President will have an opportunity to flesh out some of these themes in commencement addresses that he\xe2\x80\x99ll also deliver at Rutgers and the Air Force Academy later this year. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So were you able to get the information that you were trying to find from yesterday, you said you would find for me when it comes to this administration and HBCU\xe2\x80\x99s funding and support, et cetera?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a factsheet here. \xc2\xa0Rather than just reading through it, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll have somebody email it to you when we get done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you just highlight the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the highlight is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s FY-2017 budget seeks to strengthen funding for HBCUs. We\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of progress over the last seven or eight years in increasing the support that HBCUs receive, but the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposes $85 million in mandatory funding for HBCUs. \xc2\xa0The President also proposes an additional $244 million in discretionary funds for Title III. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the other thing that I would acknowledge is the President has sought to dramatically expand access to the Pell grant program for college students across the country. \xc2\xa0This, of course, does not apply just to African American college students but it does tangibly enhance the ability of middle-class families and those families that are trying to get into the middle class to send their kids to college. \xc2\xa0And the President\xe2\x80\x99s funding proposal for 2017 reflects continued commitment to that expansion of the Pell grant program that I think many HBCU students have actually used to afford a high-quality education at Howard University.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So let\xe2\x80\x99s go to 2016, the monies that are actually realized, the monies that actually passed. What was the number for 2016 for this fiscal year that we\xe2\x80\x99re still in?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that in front of me, but I can pull it and we can try to get you some additional data.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAndrew.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you saw that Hillary Clinton has finally come out against the possibility of TPP being passed during a lame duck session. \xc2\xa0I was wondering what you think of that, and whether it makes it look like the President\xe2\x80\x99s trade agenda is at risk of unraveling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Andrew, I\xe2\x80\x99m not particularly surprised by it. \xc2\xa0Her views on this topic are well-known. \xc2\xa0But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really change our strategy. \xc2\xa0The truth is Secretary Clinton and many other leading candidates for the presidency last year expressed opposition to Trade Promotion Authority legislation. \xc2\xa0This is ultimately legislation that paved the way for the completion of the TPP negotiations. \xc2\xa0And in spite of her opposition to that legislation, the administration worked effectively with Democrats and Republicans in both the House and the Senate to pass that bill. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe truth is passing TPA is a bigger challenge than getting Congress to ratify TPP for a couple of reasons. \xc2\xa0The first is a procedural one, which is that TPA had to overcome a filibuster effort in the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0TPP only requires 50 votes in the Senate to be ratified by the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0But the second thing -- and in some ways, this is more important -- TPA was rooted in a philosophical argument about giving the President of the United States the authority to negotiate a trade agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0That required us essentially to make a strong case that the United States Congress should trust the President to get this done and actually give him the authority necessary to complete the negotiations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow that we\xe2\x80\x99ve completed the negotiations, the American people and members of the United States Congress can evaluate the terms of the agreement and judge for themselves about whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the economy. \xc2\xa0If they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to do that, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very strong argument to make. \xc2\xa0For example, the TPP trade agreement would result in cutting 18,000 taxes that other countries impose on American products. \xc2\xa0The TPP agreement includes high and enforceable standards when it comes to protecting our environment, protecting human rights, and protecting labor rights. \xc2\xa0Those are the kinds of values-driven proposals that are included in the TPP agreement. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut those don\xe2\x80\x99t just reflect our values; they also reflect a commitment on the part of this President to leveling the playing field and giving American businesses and American workers an even better opportunity to compete in a 21st century global economy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President has made a strong case as recently as this week in The Washington Post -- he wrote an op-ed basically making clear that if the United States refuses to engage in Southeast Asia and produce a set of economic standards, then China will. \xc2\xa0And when China comes in to write the rules of the road instead of putting in place those standards, they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to insist on high environmental standards. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re certainly not going to insist on lofty human rights or labor standards. \xc2\xa0And that will only further -- if they succeed in doing that, that will only further disadvantage U.S. businesses and U.S. workers when they\xe2\x80\x99re competing for business in Southeast Asia. \xc2\xa0This is significant because Southeast Asia is home to some of the most dynamic economies in the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo from an economic, strategic, and values perspective, we have a very strong argument to make about the wisdom of Congress moving to approve the TPP agreement that the President negotiated.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Another question on trade. \xc2\xa0The Chinese believe that in 2001 they had an agreement with the U.S. -- you and various other WTO partners to, from December 11th, be treated as if it were a market economy for the purposes of antidumping duties. \xc2\xa0What would China have to do -- well, do you have the same assessment that China, after the 11th of December, must be treated as if it were a market economy? \xc2\xa0Are you ready to declare the market economy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My understanding, Andrew, about this, is rudimentary, but my understanding is that those kinds of assessments are actually reached by the Commerce Department. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them for a sense of our current assessment of China\xe2\x80\x99s economy. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d also refer you to them to answer the question about whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re considering changing that assessment.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And sorry, just a final question -- just to clear up something you said in response to Josh. \xc2\xa0Secretary Kerry actually said there would be consequences if Russia didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet the August deadline, which is enshrined in the Vienna process. \xc2\xa0But you seem to be saying that even if they keep on breaking the truce, even if there\xe2\x80\x99s no prospect of further talks, even if they keep bombing IDP camps, that there are still going to be more talks if that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what Secretary Kerry is pointing out is that Russia and President Putin himself has publicly advocated for a political transition inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0President Putin himself has acknowledged that this is an important priority. \xc2\xa0And failing to meet that deadline will have negative consequences for everybody that\xe2\x80\x99s involved. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe know that Russia -- we know based on the degree to which Russia has invested in Syria that they care deeply about the outcome. \xc2\xa0They have a lot riding on this. \xc2\xa0Russia maintains a military presence inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0Syria is the only country outside of the former Soviet bloc where Russia continues to have a military presence. \xc2\xa0So we know that they\xe2\x80\x99re quite protective of it, and concerned about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in that country so that they can protect the foothold they have in that country. \xc2\xa0Failing to succeed in negotiating a political transition is not going to be good for the Russians. \xc2\xa0It will have negative consequences for them. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying the United States benefits from that. \xc2\xa0It has negative consequences for everybody that\xe2\x80\x99s involved there. \xc2\xa0It certainly has negative consequences for everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the widespread violence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen there. \xc2\xa0So I think the point is the international community is focused on meeting this goal, and that is a priority and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that President Putin has demonstrated he\xe2\x80\x99s deeply invested in. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLook, to a large extent, he\xe2\x80\x99s put his own credibility on the line here. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s made clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to use his influence with the Assad regime to bring about this political transition that benefits Russia and that benefits the Syrian people and that benefits everybody who is involved. \xc2\xa0So it will be important for Russia to use their influence to try to advance these talks and bring them to a constructive conclusion on a timeframe that\xe2\x80\x99s been laid out. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe United States is certainly prepared to do our part, and it would be important for Russia to make clear that they expect the Assad regime to do their part as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve mostly focused on Russia on this. \xc2\xa0But at the end of the day, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Syrian regime. \xc2\xa0Would you not rule out -- would you rule out any measures against the Syrian regime if they were to stop, if they were to breeze through this August deadline?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me say -- let me take on one part of the early part of your question, which is that when the President was meeting with the GCC countries, he certainly made clear to them that it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful for them to use their influence with the opposition groups and other relevant parties to try to bring about this political transition. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the Russian government that we have been pressing, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pressing all of the parties. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been using our own influence with the opposition groups, but we certainly have encouraged our partners, who also have influence with the opposition groups, to push in the same direction here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat was the last part of your question, though? \xc2\xa0Sorry, I was distracted by the first part there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why not address the problem at its root? \xc2\xa0Why not take action directly against the Syrian regime?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Andrew, because the President has made clear there\xe2\x80\x99s not a military solution that can be imposed on the situation in Syria. \xc2\xa0I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that a lot and other administration officials have, and it sounds a little clich\xc3\xa9 at this point, but it is a core principle of our approach to this situation. \xc2\xa0This should be a lesson that we learned in 2003 -- that trying to overthrow a dictator in the Middle East has long-term and mostly negative consequences for the United States and our national security. \xc2\xa0To say nothing of the cost that would be incurred if we were to undertake that kind of action. \xc2\xa0The President would have to deploy thousands, tens of thousands, if not more than 100,000 U.S. troops on the ground that would cost a lot of money. \xc2\xa0That would mean that the United States military would sustain significant casualties. \xc2\xa0And all of that would be done without a clear exit plan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we can\xe2\x80\x99t lose track of that recent historical context when evaluating our options. \xc2\xa0The President certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have pressed so forcefully and with such tenacity on the successful completion of political talks. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a long way to go, but that continues to be our focus.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJordan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0The President needled Senator Paul a bit there over blocking these eight tax treaties.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think he was pretty gentle when you consider that these are tax treaties that have been waiting for congressional approval for -- I wrote this down -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s since -- there\xe2\x80\x99s one treaty in particular, I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s with Switzerland, that\xe2\x80\x99s been pending ratification by the United States Senate I believe since 2011. \xc2\xa0So this tax treaty that we have with Switzerland since January of 2011 has been awaiting congressional approval. \xc2\xa0We also have a critically important tax treaty with Luxembourg that\xe2\x80\x99s been awaiting congressional approval since 2010. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about more than five years of delay here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe benefit is simply we know that there are companies that use the Swiss and whatever the adjective of Luxembourg is -- (laughter) -- their financial systems. \xc2\xa0We know that there are people who use the financial systems in Switzerland and Luxembourg to evade taxation and, in some cases, to even hide their resources because they are the result of criminal actions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know exactly what the justification -- what justification Senator Paul would have for not moving forward with these agreements that would allow our law enforcement officials to combat those efforts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, but for the last couple years, actually, Senator Paul has had concerns that these treaties would infringe on Americans\xe2\x80\x99 personal tax data and other personal financial information. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the White House or the administration has done to assuage those concerns that Senator Paul has?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, my guess is, he\xe2\x80\x99s not raising concerns on the part of too many middle-class families that are using the financial system in Luxembourg to hide their assets. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure whose concerns Senator Paul is speaking up for. \xc2\xa0Maybe he can elaborate on that a little bit. \xc2\xa0I suspect it\xe2\x80\x99s not middle-class families in Kentucky that he has in mind.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then finally, with this legislation on tax shelters, has anyone from the White House reached out to Congressman Brady on the Ways and Means Committee or Senator Hatch about letting this move forward this year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that there have been conversations with members of Congress on a whole host of issues related to closing financial loopholes that entities use to get around our tax code or to evade sanctions or to store the proceeds of illicit activity. \xc2\xa0So this is a priority that the President has made here, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of important progress, and you see the administration announcing a couple of actions today that will be effective in bringing greater transparency to our financial system.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, this is the point. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken some steps here administratively. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve also made clear that there are some things that Congress can and should do. \xc2\xa0And we have been in touch with them about those measures, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to encourage them to pursue them. \xc2\xa0Does that make sense?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you saying that additional things that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been announced today are going to be announced today also?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting there\xe2\x80\x99s more coming today. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just suggesting there are some things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward that are both administrative, but we also are in touch with Congress because there are some things they should do as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMichelle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- to what extent did the Panama Papers release play into the timing of this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the rules that were announced today are actually rules that have taken at least a couple of years to put together. \xc2\xa0Obviously the nature of these rules is that they apply to extraordinarily complex financial transactions. \xc2\xa0So our experts had to comb through the regulations and ensure that there were no unintended consequences from the rules that are being put in place. \xc2\xa0So they were quite conscientious about this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut there is no denying that what they will do is bring much-needed transparency to our financial system in a way that will allow -- or at least make it much harder for people to evade paying their fair share. \xc2\xa0But also make it harder for criminals and other people to evade U.S. sanctions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The timing -- were you working on this anyway and did the Panama Papers speed it up? \xc2\xa0Did some of this have to do specifically with the Panama Papers?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to Treasury in terms of what direct impact any of these rules would have on the Panama Papers -- or on the practices that were exposed by the Panama Papers. \xc2\xa0What I can tell you is this is something that was in the works long before the Panama Papers was reported.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And were you saying that you are ruling out any action or any additional military action against Syria or any other action against Russia if the deadline, the August deadline was not observed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the point that I\xe2\x80\x99m making here is that there are negative consequences for everybody if that deadline is not met. \xc2\xa0And put another way, everybody who is engaged here, with the possible exception of Bashar al Assad himself, has a vested, personal interest in meeting the deadline to bring about a political transition inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is not a situation where the United States needs to be walking around threatening people. \xc2\xa0This is not a situation where we, frankly, need to be coercing people. \xc2\xa0We certainly will encourage them to use the influence that they have to bring about this outcome, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be doing that from the standpoint of asking people to do the United States a favor -- everybody involved in this situation has their vested interest in seeing this deadline met. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to press hard to see that that happens.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It is a deadline, though, and it kind of gets to the point of, well, what\xe2\x80\x99s the point of a deadline if it just kind of keeps going? \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling out --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s August, though, so if we don\xe2\x80\x99t meet it in August then we can go down that line of questioning.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling anything out? \xc2\xa0Is that accurate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I certainly am ruling out the kind of military action that would lead one to conclude that there might be some kind of military solution that\xe2\x80\x99s available to the United States for solving this problem. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s not -- at least not one that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with our national security interests. \xc2\xa0I guess there is one that would lead us to a years\xe2\x80\x99 long commitment to Syria that would put tens of thousands if not more than 100,000 U.S. servicemembers at risk and a whole array of consequences that has a negative impact on our national security over the long term.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And in regard to what the President said today, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say some of this before -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s not entertainment, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a reality show -- although, I mean, a huge number of Americans are very interested in what Donald Trump has to say, whether they agree with him or not. \xc2\xa0And the President also reiterated that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be President because Americans have good judgment. \xc2\xa0But given the numbers and give that he is now the Republican nominee essentially, does that mean that way, way more Americans have bad judgment than the President originally anticipated?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I think the President is merely asserting his confidence that the process that we use to choose the President of the United States is often a source of controversy, it\xe2\x80\x99s often messy, it\xe2\x80\x99s often frustrating, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a process that has served our country well. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the President has agreed with the outcome of every election, but there is a rigorous process that gives the American people enormous influence in choosing the future direction of our country. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what it means to be a democratic government. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a process that the President is committed to. \xc2\xa0And the President has got confidence in the ability of American voters to take that process seriously, to educate themselves on the issues, to engage in the debate, and allow all of that to inform the choice that they make at the ballot box.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKenneth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, we could tell from the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks that he\xe2\x80\x99s itching to get out there on the campaign trail. \xc2\xa0So does the President believe that the House, and the Senate even are in play for the Democrats?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, yeah, there obviously is an aggressive campaign that will be mounted by individual candidates all across the country, and those will be important contests. \xc2\xa0And, yes, the President is optimistic about Democratic prospects up and down the ballot this year. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Iran, did the administration have \xe2\x80\x9chand-picked\xe2\x80\x9d beltway insiders to push the message, to sell the message of the Iran deal to the public? \xc2\xa0And the characterization that\xe2\x80\x99s out there, it has been reported that the administration misled the public in a manner as well. \xc2\xa0How does the administration respond to that characterization that the public was misled in the selling of the Iran deal?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anybody produce any evidence to indicate that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case. \xc2\xa0I recognize that there might be some people who are disappointed that they did not succeed in killing the Iran deal, and maybe these unfounded claims are the result of sour grapes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe truth is, the administration, at the direction of the President, engaged in an aggressive campaign to make a strong case to the American people that the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon strengthened the national security of the United States. \xc2\xa0We made a strong case that it strengthened the national security of our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel. \xc2\xa0We made a strong case that killing the deal would actually make another war in the Middle East more likely. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President made clear -- he ran on this back in 2007 and 2008 -- that the most effective way for the United States to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon was strong, principled diplomacy. \xc2\xa0And he was right. \xc2\xa0And he succeeded in carrying that out, despite the entrenched opposition and skepticism that something like this was even possible. \xc2\xa0So the President is quite proud of our success in completing that agreement because of the positive impact that that has had on U.S. national security in the short term, and the prospects that it enhances for an improved posture for the United States around the world over the long term.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But, Josh, the characterization I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking of came from a profile on your Deputy National Security Advisor, Ben Rhodes. \xc2\xa0You read that article. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve had time to digest it. \xc2\xa0Do you disagree with some of the characterizations that were in that profile?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he said \xe2\x80\x9cmisleading\xe2\x80\x9d in there anywhere. \xc2\xa0It was rather long, so maybe I missed it. \xc2\xa0But the administration is quite proud of the fact that we made a strong, principled, fact-based case to the American people that the international agreement, negotiated by the President\xe2\x80\x99s team, to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just completed; it was effectively implemented in a way that has enhanced the national security of the United States. And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an important part of this President\xe2\x80\x99s legacy and is a promise he made during the campaign, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a promise that he kept as President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKevin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0How concerned is the President that the much-talked-about 67 consecutive months of net-job gains might also end on his watch, given the tepid growth in April?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, we\xe2\x80\x99re up to 74 consecutive months --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s only private sector -- 67 overall, 74 is just private sector.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I see. \xc2\xa0And 67 refers to?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Total.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Total.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So when government loses jobs, it\xe2\x80\x99s 67.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I see. \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re putting the decline in government jobs on the President\xe2\x80\x99s tab here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, given the 67 months -- or if you just want to use the 74 figure, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine, that\xe2\x80\x99s private sector -- how concerned is he --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we do know that the private sector was really important to leading our economic recovery, so that\xe2\x80\x99s the number that we focused on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How concerned is he given the relatively tepid growth in April that that might also end on his watch?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President feels pretty good about the strong economic growth that we showed in April. \xc2\xa0And it certainly is consistent with the longer-term trend that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen. \xc2\xa0And so the President is pleased about the direction of the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0There is surely more that could be done, that would ensure that more families across the country are enjoying the benefits of that recovery, and our economy would be even stronger and even more durable than it already is if Congress weren\xe2\x80\x99t blocking some common-sense proposals that would strengthen our economy further.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President talked a lot about how investing in our infrastructure would be good for our economy, both in the short term and the long term, in part because it would create jobs and generate the kind of economic multiplier that would ripple across the economy in a positive way. \xc2\xa0But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that there are some headwinds that emanate from overseas that the United States must be prepared to weather. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRight now, the U.S. economy is the envy of the world. \xc2\xa0This is the most durable economy in the world. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s more that we can do to make it even stronger, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes that Congress should vote to raise the minimum wage. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes that Congress should vote to make important investments in our infrastructure. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes that Congress should expand funding for job training and other education programs that would ensure the next generation of Americans has the skills and training that they need to continue this economic strength that our country enjoys. \xc2\xa0We should not take it for granted. \xc2\xa0And failing to invest in the fundamentals is the surest way to break that streak. \xc2\xa0And the President is determined to not let that happen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow then, you mentioned some of the worldwide or international headwinds. \xc2\xa0Domestically, our workforce participation rate now is at 62.8 percent -- the lowest in decades. \xc2\xa0What has the President done to stem that tide? \xc2\xa0We heard Jason previously suggest that because more Americans are retiring and because we\xe2\x80\x99re graying, that number is going to shrink. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the President doing to combat that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, one thing we could do -- look, first of all, that\xe2\x80\x99s true. \xc2\xa0This is a direct function of the longer-term trends in our society, which is that as the Baby Boomers age, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to retire and that is going to put more strain on our workforce. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s all the more reason that making sure we have an educated workforce that we are investing in research and development that could boost the environment for businesses that are looking to capitalize on technology and innovation to bring new ideas and new products to market. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President also made a reference to reforming our legal immigration system. \xc2\xa0We know that the brightest minds and many of the brightest minds that other countries have to offer are interested in coming to the United States. \xc2\xa0Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we create an opportunity for entrepreneurs and scientists and others who are looking to start a business or grow a business to come to the United States? \xc2\xa0That would certainly be good for our economy. It would create jobs in our economy, by definition, and would continue to nurture the strong business climate that we have here in the United States, where people are given an opportunity to pursue new ideas and get an education that will allow them to succeed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President certainly believes that there are a number of things that we could do, and comprehensive immigration reform that enhances our national security but streamlines our legal immigration system is certainly another option.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, to the best of your knowledge, has anyone on the current White House staff been interviewed in relation to the ongoing investigation into Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s email server?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed before, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about ongoing investigations. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s apparent in the newspaper that some people are willing to do that. \xc2\xa0But the fact is the people who are leading the investigation are professionals. \xc2\xa0They\'re committed to getting this right. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re committed to doing this by the book and making sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re not influenced by political considerations, even in the highly charged political environment in an election year.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do my best to help them do what they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do by giving them the space that they need to conduct this investigation in the way that they see fit that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with where the facts lead them. \xc2\xa0And then once they have results that they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to discuss, we can take a look at it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you confirm that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been interviewed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about the investigation, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to think that I have been.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCarol.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You seem to be downplaying the significance of the political shake-up in Turkey, but it\xe2\x80\x99s happening at the same time as the political crisis in Iraq. \xc2\xa0And obviously both of these countries are critical to the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy against Islamic State. \xc2\xa0So how can you not think this is such a big deal or not have a significant impact on the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy? \xc2\xa0And what is he doing to try to mitigate that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Carol, at this point, there has been no impact on our coordination and our ability to work with Turkey to advance our campaign against ISIL. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve received extensive cooperation from them in the last six or nine months on a range of issues, and our campaign has benefitted from that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEven as we have intensified our cooperation on a set of counter-ISIL issues, we\xe2\x80\x99ve not refrained from raising our concerns about Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s fidelity to their constitution. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make those concerns known, both in public and in private, when appropriate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are there any specific logistical plans in place or discussions happening on what to do if this worsens? \xc2\xa0Both in Iraq and Turkey?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, they\xe2\x80\x99re quite different situations. \xc2\xa0I mean, there are always people in the United States government who are engaged in contingency planning, so I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place at some level. \xc2\xa0But look, when it comes to the situation in Iraq, we continue to support the efforts of Prime Minister Abadi to try to unify that country. \xc2\xa0And we believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the most effective way for Iraq to confront the threat that they face from ISIL.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think obviously the thing that both of these countries have in common is that they\xe2\x80\x99re sovereign countries with sovereign governments. \xc2\xa0And we respect the sovereignty of our partners in the same way that we expect our partners to respect the sovereignty of the United States as well. \xc2\xa0But what we can do is we continue to -- we can support these countries as they confront the significant challenges that are having a destabilizing impact on their politics in this region of the world. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that the instability in Syria, the widespread migration crisis, the violence from ISIL -- all of that has had a negative impact on Syria\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors. \xc2\xa0And that certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make an effective political resolution in Turkey and Iraq more likely. \xc2\xa0I would argue that\xe2\x80\x99s actually yet another reason for the United States and the rest of the international community to continue to drive toward a political transition inside of Syria; that resolving the political turmoil in Syria will have a dampening effect on the destabilizing impact that Syria has had on its neighbors, including Iraq and Turkey.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGregory.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to belabor the point, but I want to give you a chance to go back to the question that you were asked yesterday about intelligence briefings for presidential candidates. \xc2\xa0You seemed to leave us with the impression, intentionally or unintentionally, that you were not willing to give Mr. Trump the same benefit of the doubt as you would Secretary Clinton and his ability to handle classified information responsibly. \xc2\xa0Was that the impression you meant to give? \xc2\xa0And also we heard from the President just this morning about his concern with some of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric, that it could threaten war or has the potential of offending our critical relationships with other countries. \xc2\xa0Given those concerns that the President has expressed, should the American people have any concern with this particular presidential candidate receiving our nation\xe2\x80\x99s most classified information?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Gregory, the impression that I intended to leave yesterday is that the decision about what material to present to the two presidential candidates who are nominated by the two major political parties will be made by our professionals in the intelligence community. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI did offer an opinion about Secretary Clinton that was rooted in her service as Secretary of State in the Obama administration. \xc2\xa0She is somebody who undeniably served closely with the President with distinction, and she was critical to advancing a number of policy priorities, including the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And that required her to handle sensitive information and to use it in the course of her job to advance our nation\xe2\x80\x99s interests. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what she did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, ultimately, the decision about how and when and where to give the candidates these briefings will be made by professionals in the intelligence community without regard to partisan considerations. \xc2\xa0In terms of the American people, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make up their own minds. \xc2\xa0I think that they can take -- that certainly is true when it comes to deciding who to vote for. \xc2\xa0But in terms of making decisions about providing sensitive information to individual candidates, I think the American people can have confidence in our intelligence professionals to make that decision.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that, historically, these briefings have always been done as a courtesy by the sitting President -- maybe more than a courtesy, more of a matter of long-term preservation of our national security -- but they are authorized by the sitting President for the candidates for President. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no law requiring these, and the President could use his discretion to give or not -- or to deny these briefings to any presidential candidate -- is that correct?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of the specifics of the law. \xc2\xa0What I can say is that the Director of National Intelligence has indicated that he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to move forward at an appropriate time, probably after the convention, with giving intelligence briefings to the two major party nominees. \xc2\xa0And Director Clapper has assigned that responsibility to one of the career intelligence professionals in his office, and the President has confidence in those professionals and their ability to determine how and when those briefings should take place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the week ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President invited the Indian Prime Minister to the White House next month? \xc2\xa0Do you have anything to say?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you. \xc2\xa0I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s been some discussion about the potential of Prime Minister Modi visiting Washington and visiting the White House. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on those discussions at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on the statement made by the President today on the shell companies opened by foreigners in the U.S., it\xe2\x80\x99s reported that quite a number of Indian politicians and businesses have opened shell companies here in the U.S. \xc2\xa0Is the U.S. willing to share that information with the Indian government and help to get those money back to India?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me say a couple things about this. \xc2\xa0The rule that was announced today by the Treasury Department applied to a very specific group of LLCs, and it would have an impact on that specific group. \xc2\xa0I know that it is not uncommon for the United States to reach transparency agreements with other countries in terms of sharing this information -- those are typically reciprocal agreements. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what kind of agreement is in place to govern the conversations between the United States and India. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with my colleagues at the Treasury Department and they could provide some additional information about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- and on the F-16s to Pakistan. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a hold in the Congress right now, and the State Department has informed Pakistan that they should muster their national resources if they want to buy the F-16s. \xc2\xa0Do you think this would have any impact on U.S. relations with Pakistan in any way?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I will just say is something you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say before, which is that the United States has an important counterterrorism and national security relationship with Pakistan. \xc2\xa0We value the kind of cooperation that we get with Pakistan and we have found that cooperation beneficial to the national security of both of our countries. \xc2\xa0And President Obama has obviously worked hard, even in some challenging circumstances, to cultivate an effective working relationship with Pakistan. \xc2\xa0And we believe that preserving that relationship and nurturing that relationship is beneficial to the national security of the United States, but also the national security of Pakistan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that, let me do a week ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Monday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will welcome the NCAA Champion UConn Huskies Women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball team to the White House. \xc2\xa0He will host an event that will honor the team and their 2016 NCAA championship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Wednesday and Thursday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Friday, the President will host the President of Finland and the Prime Ministers of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland at the White House for a U.S.-Nordic Leaders Summit. \xc2\xa0This event follows the convening of Nordic leaders during the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Sweden in September of 2013. \xc2\xa0This summit will deepen U.S.-Nordic cooperation while highlighting America\xe2\x80\x99s continued commitment to European security, transatlantic trade, and the promotion of common democratic values.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn the evening, Friday evening, the President and First Lady will host the Nordic leaders for a state dinner.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Sunday -- not this coming Sunday, but next Sunday -- the President will travel to Rutgers University\xe2\x80\x99s New Brunswick campus to address the 2016 graduates at Rutgers University\xe2\x80\x99s 250th anniversary commencement ceremony. \xc2\xa0Rutgers University is one of the oldest universities in the country, with a long and distinguished history of advancing research and preparing students with the skills they need to succeed in the new economy. Additional details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to New Jersey will be available next week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that, I hope you guys all have a great weekend. \xc2\xa0And happy Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day to all of your mothers.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:37 P.M.
