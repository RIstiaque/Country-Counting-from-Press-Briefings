EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, and welcome aboard Air Force One, en route to Milwaukee, where the President will celebrate the city\xe2\x80\x99s win in the Healthy Communities Challenge. \xc2\xa0As you all know, this was a competition between 20 cities launched last November to increase the number of Americans with health insurance during open enrollment. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAhead of the upcoming sixth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, the President will discuss how Americans in communities across the country are benefitting from the law. \xc2\xa0As you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on our itinerary today, the President will sit down for a conversation with a few local residents who have written him about the impact of the law on themselves and their families. \xc2\xa0And after that, he\'ll give remarks on the campus of the United Community Center, which is a facility that hosted ACA outreach efforts over the last enrollment period.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think you can expect him to discuss today the progress we we\'ve made in the nearly six years since he signed the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0For example, during the recent enrollment period, nearly 13 million Americans signed up for health care. \xc2\xa0In Milwaukee alone, nearly 90,000 people signed up this year. \xc2\xa0And that\'s about 38,000 of them were new customers this year. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is the law that\xe2\x80\x99s driven down the insurance rate below 10 percent for the first time since we started keeping records. \xc2\xa0And it\'s thanks in part to this law\xe2\x80\x99s focus on reducing costs and inefficiencies that health care prices have risen at the slowest rate in 50 years since the law was passed. \xc2\xa0This is something that will obviously benefit Americans today, but also something that we\'re particularly proud of -- a trend that will continue for years to come.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Affordable Care Act has succeeded, despite congressional Republicans voting nearly 60 times to repeal it. \xc2\xa0Republicans have been bent over the past six years on tearing it down, but thankfully they have been unsuccessful in their efforts to do so. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve also been unsuccessful to conjure up any alternatives to Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0And so, despite all that, this year, with our partners on the ground, the administration undertook an unprecedented local and regional effort to sign up the remaining 10.5 million uninsured people who are eligible for marketplace coverage. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is going to be highlighting this afternoon in Milwaukee.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What does the President think of his former campaign rival giving campaign advice?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I saw that Governor Romney was giving a speech. \xc2\xa0I did not get a chance to see the speech before we took off. \xc2\xa0And I have to be honest with you, I don\'t think I\'ll be watching it when we get back.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will the President be watching --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\'t think so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Eric, the Affordable Care Act, I know you want to highlight -- it\'s nearing its six-year anniversary. \xc2\xa0Why do you think tracking polls still indicate that more voters disapprove of the law than approve of it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Kevin, I think it\'s a fair question, and it\'s one that -- there\xe2\x80\x99s that old phrase, follow the money. \xc2\xa0And I think Republicans and our critics have spent hundreds of millions of dollars distorting the truth about this law, fueling conspiracy theories about this law, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have an impact. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut if you look at the actual impact of what this has done, which has, again, slowed the rate of *rate price increases to unprecedented lows, brought the uninsured rate down to unprecedented lows, saved hospitals billions of dollars, and generally made our population healthier, those are all good things. \xc2\xa0And the President is going to make that case today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Donald Trump is also talking about health care today. He released his health care plan with his campaign last night. \xc2\xa0Is that a plan that the President has had a chance to take a look at? \xc2\xa0And does he have any thoughts on Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ideas?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Angela, I did not have a chance to review that plan, either, before we took off, which is surprising because I understand that it\xe2\x80\x99s seven bullet points. \xc2\xa0But my understanding is that it is the same pieces we\'ve seen before by Republicans, which are repeal the Affordable Care Act, but have no ideas with what to replace it with.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Eric, can you give us an update on the Supreme Court process? \xc2\xa0How many candidates is the White House currently looking at and how many are being vetted?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Jeff, I don\'t have too much of an update for you. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that the President\xe2\x80\x99s work on this remains dogged. \xc2\xa0This is something he\xe2\x80\x99s spending a lot of time on. \xc2\xa0As you know, this process began a few weeks ago, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been spending time reviewing potential candidates, meeting with his team on potential candidates, and really looking for the best person for the job. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind, that boils down to a few principles. \xc2\xa0One is, we have to make sure that that nominee is unquestionably qualified, they have impeccable credentials -- that\'s a threshold question for the President. \xc2\xa0The second is to make sure they\xe2\x80\x99ve demonstrated loyalty to the rule of law; that their fidelity to the judicial process is unquestioned. \xc2\xa0And thirdly, in those rare instances when the law is unclear, which is, admittedly, an episode that comes up frequently on the High Court, that the President wants to have an understanding of how that nominee will bring his or her own moral bearings to a particular case.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo those are the questions he\xe2\x80\x99s working through as he researches potential nominees. \xc2\xa0And I know that that work continues in earnest.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the Republican opposition to having any hearings concerning a nominee whatsoever made it harder for the President to find the right nominee? \xc2\xa0Have potential nominees pulled out of the running because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to put themselves through that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Kevin, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that. \xc2\xa0What I have heard is, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, Republicans have offered a reflexive opposition to considering the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee, even though we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even named one. \xc2\xa0As we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, we find that unfortunate. \xc2\xa0I did note that Chairman Grassley I think over the past day or so has broken with Leader McConnell in saying that he would consider meeting with a nominee. \xc2\xa0We think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good first step.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Looking beyond Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s speech today, how does the President see these anti-Trump initiatives in some corners of the Republican Party?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, I think you all have access to a lot smarter Republican strategists than the one you\xe2\x80\x99re speaking to now. \xc2\xa0What I would say is that, for years, the Republican Party has created a vacuum in Washington by neglecting their own responsibilities to govern. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to walk through a couple of examples of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you look at the timely, today issue of the Affordable Care Act and health care in this country, that\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that matters to hundreds of millions of Americans. \xc2\xa0The President went ahead and worked with members of Congress to put forward a plan. \xc2\xa0That plan passed the House of Representatives and the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0It was a complicated and hard process, but the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t give up. \xc2\xa0And Republicans have spent the past seven years just trying to tear it up and offer no alternatives of their own.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you look at the issue of gun safety, again, the President supports some common-sense measures we can take to reduce gun violence in this country. \xc2\xa0Republicans have thrown up their hands and opted to do nothing. \xc2\xa0If you look at the issue of immigration reform, the President worked with members of his party and Republicans in the United States Senate, worked to come up with a bipartisan plan. \xc2\xa0Republicans in the House rejected it, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even bring it up for a vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I know that Republicans are reckoning with their political prognosis today, but it also shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a surprise to those who have observed this for the past few years that their lack of leadership in Washington has created the exact vacuum that outsiders have looked to fill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How soon will we see a nominee? \xc2\xa0As soon as tomorrow maybe? \xc2\xa0And how do you plan to roll it out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated timetable for you. \xc2\xa0As you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve pointed to past precedent on this, and that has generally been four to five weeks. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated timetable for you. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that the President continues to work on this. \xc2\xa0This is a very significant priority for him. \xc2\xa0So he\xe2\x80\x99s spending a lot of time on this, as is his team. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- sources said yesterday that an Iowa judge is one of the people being vetted. \xc2\xa0Is that a calculated move, given the importance of Senator Grassley to this process?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Angela, if that\xe2\x80\x99s an attempt to get me to speculate on potential nominees, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to exercise some restraint and not take the bait. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you point out, there are plenty of judges -- in fact, I believe most of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s judges have engendered bipartisan support. \xc2\xa0These are judges that deserve and get support from Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the President\xe2\x80\x99s prior two Supreme Court justices, Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan. \xc2\xa0Both earned confirmation with Republican and Democratic support. \xc2\xa0And I have no doubt that the nominee the President puts forward to fill Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s seat will deserve bipartisan support, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t12:05 P.M.
