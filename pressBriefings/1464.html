Brady Press Briefing Room</div>\n</div>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>12:45 P.M. EST</p>\n<p><br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know who the President is rooting for in the World Series yet?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I emailed this to Basinet, who asked at the conclusion of last Friday\'s briefing --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was the one who asked this question -- for the record.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry.\xc2\xa0 He emailed me, because I guess --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because you evaded the question.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer.\xc2\xa0 It drew some apparent attention in New York.\xc2\xa0 I asked the President.\xc2\xa0 He said he hoped for a good series, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a strong pull for either team.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There goes Pennsylvania.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see.\xc2\xa0 What\'s that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that means seven games?\xc2\xa0 A good series?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he would probably hope to see seven.\xc2\xa0 I know Jake would hope to be around for seven.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no doubt that he was rooting for Plouffe last year, but apparently he thinks Plouffe is just fine this year.</p>\n<p>So, Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 A few questions on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 When the President announced earlier this year he was sending more troops --this was back in March -- he said that the Afghan government was undermined by corruption and he said "We will seek a new compact with the Afghan government that cracks down on corrupt behavior and set clear benchmarks."\xc2\xa0 So, to start, I\'m wondering has this government delivered on any of that yet?\xc2\xa0 Are you all measuring whether the Karzai government is trying to stop corruption and whether that\'s working?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President was alluding to in March is precisely the conversations that are being had by the embassy, by the ambassador, by the State Department, and by others here with the newly elected Karzai government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s a process that\'s still starting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, these are conversations, as I mentioned yesterday, that were had before and during the election process that took quite some time.\xc2\xa0 But the President and his team are actively engaged in seeking that new compact.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said just yesterday that -- he reiterated that he wants a more serious effort to eradicate corruption, better governance, and so forth.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering, are those -- he talked about he wants deeds not just words.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering when he lays out those points that he\'s looking for, what is he -- are they just wishes, or is there going to be any connection between wanting to see results and his decision to send more troops?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, understand the end of the quote that you read set clear benchmarks for international assistance that is used to provide for the needs of the Afghan people.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as the President reiterates, this is not just rhetoric; there have to be deliverables to this.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t want to get ahead of where the process is at this point in commenting on some of the specifics.\xc2\xa0 I\'d also mention what the President said yesterday, that includes an infrastructure for training Afghan national security forces.\xc2\xa0 Both the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police ultimately are going to have to take charge of the security situation in the country.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve said this, the President has said this, that we\'re not going to be there forever.</p>\n<p>What is accomplished on the security side will eventually have to be transferred to those two entities that comprise the Afghan national security forces, and that\'s certainly part of improved governance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to sum up here, I guess I\'m just trying to figure out the connection between those important points that this government is looking for from Afghanistan and the President\'s upcoming decision.\xc2\xa0 Is there a direct connection?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, as I said yesterday, Ben, there isn\'t anybody involved in these discussions, whether you\'re on the civilian side from the State Department, whether you\'re on the civilian side of the National Security Council -- I have no idea what that noise was -- or whether or not -- or whether you\'re in the military at the Pentagon, that without improvement and without a sustained effort by the government of Afghanistan, our efforts there are not and won\'t be successful.\xc2\xa0 So obviously ensuring improved governance is part of that equation.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the corruption issue in particular, are there any deadlines or actual measuring sticks that are being contemplated now to impose upon Karzai --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as I said, I don\'t want to get ahead of the process that\'s ongoing with the embassy right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It has been years in which Karzai has been under this kind of pressure, and are we to see something new here that hasn\'t been tried before?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President was clear yesterday that it was time for a new chapter, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I don\'t want to delve too far back into the history of this, but I don\'t think there\'s anybody that would tell you that we can continue doing what has been done in years past and hope to see different results.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 European Commission President Barroso is here and he\'ll be meeting with the President later.\xc2\xa0 He already said today that the European countries have no interest in sending more troops to Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Does that in any way affect or figure into the President\'s review process on a possible U.S. --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\'s a security conference I think scheduled -- I don\'t have the calendar in front of me -- I think for the 23rd of November involving NATO countries, and I\'ll wait for them to meet and have more definitive news on this.</p>\n<p>Yes, Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Working on good governance and anticorruption -- those are general goals.\xc2\xa0 What are some specific things that you guys will be looking for?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not going to get into discussing publicly the compact that\'s -- that the embassy is working through with the Afghan government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The CIT bankruptcy, do you guys have any response to that?\xc2\xa0 It\'s $2.3 billion of taxpayer money that I guess is just going to vanish into thin air.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously CIT received, as you mentioned, several billion dollars of assistance in December of 2008.\xc2\xa0 They have come back a couple of times looking for additional assistance.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve had a year to restructure, which they are now in a process that is now ongoing.\xc2\xa0 We are heartened by the fact that they will continue to lend to important small business customers and we will continue to seek ways to stabilize the financial system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the taxpayers just out that money?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\'s obviously a process that\'s now -- that will now be ongoing in terms of their planned bankruptcy.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we have a stake in how that comes out as to the -- taxpayers have invested that money.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to talk about H1N1 virus.\xc2\xa0 A year ago in the campaign one of the themes from the President was about Republicans had not governed very effectively -- citing Katrina, war in Iraq, incompetence in government.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to H1N1 you made some big promises about tens of millions of vaccines that would be available to the American people.\xc2\xa0 They are obviously not available.\xc2\xa0 And so far the message has been that the manufacturing companies had really rosy scenarios.\xc2\xa0 But don\'t people here in the Obama administration bear some responsibility for not asking the right questions, getting the right answers from these manufacturers before you told the American people you could deliver 120 million vaccinations?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, did we fell -- fall to the scenarios that the manufacturers said that they could manufacture a vaccine in?\xc2\xa0 Of course.\xc2\xa0 Ed, I\'ll take you back to last spring at the beginning of this process, in which H1N1 is a virus that we see popping up around the world, around the globe.\xc2\xa0 The President took very strong action in setting up a team to deal with this.\xc2\xa0 I\'m reminded of -- I think there was some snickering about the President talking about how to cough and how to sneeze and that you should wash your hands, all of which for anybody that has -- knows somebody with that, it\'s not a laughing matter now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the President and his team have taken extraordinary action to deal with this situation.\xc2\xa0 And as I said last week, Ed, I don\'t know if you asked this or somebody else did, obviously the President is frustrated that there\'s anybody that is in one of these groups, at a high-risk group, that is having trouble getting the vaccine now.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re making progress on getting more and more of that vaccine each day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\'s your promise to the American people now? Because they are wondering -- they\'re waiting in long lines, sometimes they wait two hours and they get to the front of the line, there\'s no more vaccine.\xc2\xa0 What\'s your message then?\xc2\xa0 What\'s the promise now about --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The promise is that we\'re working each and every day to fix this.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what the updated numbers are.\xc2\xa0 I know there\'s a daily briefing now with -- that I\'m sure many of your technical questions will be addressed.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the available number of doses now, but when we went through this last week there were 3 million additional doses over a two-day period of time.\xc2\xa0 And again, the President is working every day -- ensure that people that want and need this vaccine have it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last thing -- while you\'re still trying to ensure that, and there are a lot of Americans who haven\'t been able to get it, why did the Obama administration decide to make the vaccine available to prisoners at Guantanamo Bay?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There is no vaccine in Guantanamo and there\'s no vaccine on the way to Guantanamo.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the Pentagon was wrong when it confirmed that on Friday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what the Pentagon said.\xc2\xa0 I know in asking yesterday whether or not there was any vaccine there or whether there was any vaccine that was on its way, the answer to both those questions was no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the White House stop --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, that was because there wasn\'t any there and there wasn\'t any on the way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to the topic of money possibly vanishing into thin air, it\'s not just CIT.\xc2\xa0 GAO reported yesterday that the taxpayers will probably never recoup all or even close to all of the tens of billions of dollars that have been poured into General Motors and Chrysler.\xc2\xa0 Should the American people assume that that money is just gone?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think so.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s what the GAO reported.\xc2\xa0 The President made some tough and extraordinary decisions to seek some financial assistance for GM and Chrysler.\xc2\xa0 Again, not easy decisions, but the President also believed that we had a chance to remake a more competitive American auto industry that employs tens of thousands of Americans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But GA found that they would have to have a market cap --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 GAO.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GAO, excuse me, would have to have a market capitalization of $67 billion.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve never exceeded $57 billion.\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t it just wishful thinking to think that they would ever get to that level again?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we need to do is get our economy moving again so that we have car sales that begin to see an uptick.\xc2\xa0 I think you saw reports yesterday of the first time that Ford Motor Company had turned a profit in its North American operation since 2005 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Ford and GM are very different creatures.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\'re talking about -- I mean, everybody has been talking about a sized-down GM.\xc2\xa0 How are they going to exceed their market capitalization --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The basis for any market capitalization is what?\xc2\xa0 Cars, right?\xc2\xa0 So obviously we have seen a -- as the economy has slowed, a decline from traditional auto sales figures that you saw in 2006, or even 2007 and parts of 2008.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is working each and every day to get the economy moving again, to create conditions where people have the type of income they need to purchase new cars.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve instituted new fuel mileage standards so that the new cars that people buy go farther on a tank of gas and spit out less pollutants as they do so.\xc2\xa0 And I think we see that GM and Chrysler have begun to make strides in putting themselves on firmer footing.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that $67 billion, or depending on how you count it, $67 billion that went in to those two companies, what can the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That or that market capitalization?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s the money that went to them.\xc2\xa0 How much of that can the American people expect to get back?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read the full report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but are you saying that the American people will get a substantial amount of it back?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any of that -- I think the American people will see some of that money returned, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot of it, a little of it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not the car czar.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\'s decision on Afghanistan is still weeks, plural, away?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It was weeks yesterday, and it\'s weeks today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 What additional information is the President waiting for to make a decision?\xc2\xa0 Are there outstanding issues?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President continues to meet with advisors.\xc2\xa0 He met last Friday with the Joint Chiefs and they\'ll be back again for an additional meeting either late this week or early next week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he feel a sense of urgency at all?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s said that since the beginning, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It just seems that there\'s a lot of meetings -- we now have the election.\xc2\xa0 I just wonder if you could let us in on the process here, particularly in the context, let\'s face it, of some accusations of delaying or dithering.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering if you could let us into the process --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I addressed those -- I addressed those so-called allegations before.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess -- but you understand what I\'m getting at.\xc2\xa0 What is the President trying --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Vaguely.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 What is the President hoping to learn?\xc2\xa0 What is he -- what more information is he hoping to obtain?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me explain this the way I explained this yesterday, Savannah.\xc2\xa0 The President -- as you saw administration officials explaining over the weekend, the President and his team have a goal that remains unchanged:\xc2\xa0 to dismantle, disrupt and ultimately destroy al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 That is -- what the team is working on putting together is a military and a civilian strategy that best accomplishes that goal.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the team has been evaluating in Afghanistan, how that relates to our relationship with Pakistan, and the region as a whole in crafting a policy that addresses all of these things.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 Will the President seek to meet with General McChrystal in person here at the White House before making his decision?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have said in the past that that will likely be the case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up?\xc2\xa0 Why would the decision not come sooner now that the election has been settled?\xc2\xa0 Wasn\'t that one of the reasons it was taking so long?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The election certainly was part of the equation, but not the whole equation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s -- it should be sooner now that the election is settled.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if it\'s part of the equation then that\'s one factor that now has been settled.\xc2\xa0 So you\'d think you could move more quickly.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s been a couple of days, but I still think it\'s a couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 First, on the election --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which one?\xc2\xa0 You\'ve got to be a little more specific.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The elections of today.\xc2\xa0 A year ago the President was appealing to independent voters, Republican voters as a post-partisan politician.\xc2\xa0 And in recent appearances, especially on Sunday, he seemed to be trying to rally the Democratic base.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if the lesson for midterm elections next year and for today\'s elections is that post-partisanship is over and now it\'s a question of just getting out the base.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t -- well, that generally happens two days before an election, right?\xc2\xa0 You tend to want to get your voters -- I know this isn\'t a new concept -- you tend to want to get your voters to the poll on Election Day.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s generally the case.\xc2\xa0 This President believes that the candidates that he\'s made appearances for are -- he believes will be -- are the best candidates for the jobs with which they\'re running.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In talking about appealing to both independent voters -- I\'d let the President\'s approval rating with independent voters speak for itself.\xc2\xa0 And I think if you look at the efforts that the President has made and the perception of the efforts -- the perception that people have about those efforts, that they see a President that\'s trying to work with the Republican Party on the issues that are important to the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We tried that in the recovery plan.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve tried that with health care only to have, I think in the last 24 hours, Republicans finally decide to come up with their alternative ideas for health care reform -- health care reform ideas, I might mention, that by all reports don\'t include banning insurance companies from discriminating against sick people.</p>\n<p>But the President is going to continue to try to work with Republicans that seek to and want to work -- seek to work with him and want to work for reform and to address the issues that are important in people\'s lives.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On health care, do you think -- does the President feel that the House bill is sufficiently neutral on the abortion question, or would he support some conservative Democrats who want -- would want language --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to interject from here into a process of discussion on the House side of how to address that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And although you\'ve said it before, you haven\'t said it today:\xc2\xa0 On the referendum issue --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m happy to do it again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If Creigh Deeds or Jon Corzine or Bill Owens were to win today, the President doesn\'t want any credit, and if they lose he doesn\'t want any blame?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t -- unclear if I\'ve had an opportunity to intone either of those.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Please take it now.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I simply said -- and I find it -- I\'m always amused by the fact that the motives for which I say these things are always imparted -- this is just what I believe.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the two gubernatorial races -- I don\'t think looking at the two gubernatorial races, you can draw with any great insight what\'s going to happen a year from now any more than if Jake\'s team wins tomorrow night I can tell who\'s going to win next year\'s World Series.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not really what I was asking.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 If the three candidates that the President has campaigned for and wants to win and are seen as the three key races this year, if they win, will the White House view it as support for the President\'s views or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we don\'t look at either of these gubernatorial races or the congressional race as something that portends a lot for our legislative efforts going forward or political prospects in 2010.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You still didn\xe2\x80\x99t hit it on the nail, you know that?\xc2\xa0 Is it deliberate, or is it --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- maybe we\'re just passing in the night, Mark.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether that\'s -- maybe with less sound, but it\'s -- yes, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Warren Buffett described his acquisition of Burlington Northern represents an all-in wager in the economic future of the United States.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House take this as an endorsement of the President\'s economic policies?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am not going to comment on the investment decisions of certain investors.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that would --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ve moved markets before.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I\'m seeking desperately for a little stability today.\xc2\xa0 I think that Warren Buffett is somebody who obviously, as you know, the President has sought advice and counsel from, but I\'m not going to get into his individual investment decisions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s more than just words.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\'s talking about it\'s an instant all-in wager in the economic future of the United States.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you know, if we\'re back to baseball metaphors, this is a big fat one right up the middle.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will simply say this.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President values his advice, as he does many others, and the President is doing what he believes is right and best to get our economy back on track and moving again -- I think you saw that in the statistics that were released just at the end of last week -- and hope that people continue to have confidence in the decisions that the President makes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, the education speech in Madison, what can we expect on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you all -- I\'ll leave some of this aside for you all to talk to Melody about in a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President has, through both the recovery plan and through initiatives at the Department of Education, sought to reform our schools so that they can better compete in the 21st century and create a more skilled workforce to assume the jobs that we\'re creating for the future.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will take some time to talk about those efforts tomorrow, and I would encourage you all to get on the phone and ask Melody specifically about that.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, let me follow up on Mark, if I could.\xc2\xa0 Sunday when the President appeared with Governor Corzine, Governor Corzine said, "I\'m going to be a partner."\xc2\xa0 The President said Jon Corzine has been a reliable partner.\xc2\xa0 Corzine has made it very clear that he wants to work with the President, has talked about job creation and jobs saved in New Jersey because of the stimulus.\xc2\xa0 Why then shouldn\'t what happens today reflect in some way shape or form the New Jersey\'s attitudes about their governor partnering with this President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because in Virginia that has not been the message of the Democratic candidate, to the consternation here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Creigh Deeds did not say, "I\'m an Obama Democrat," and the White House did not take kindly that strategic approach to his campaign.\xc2\xa0 So when you have two different campaigns like that, why shouldn\'t what happens in New Jersey at least reflect in some way, shape or form what voters are thinking about Corzine and the President now -- not 2010, but now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll let people look into their crystal balls and figure out what all this stuff means for the future.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the best candidate to lead New Jersey today and tomorrow is Jon Corzine.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the endorsement is about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Governor Corzine was somebody who the President knew and worked with in the Senate and somebody he believes is best suited to lead New Jersey for the next four years.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what the endorsement means, and I think that\'s the support that the President was trying to convey.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if Corzine wins, then his endorsement means what?\xc2\xa0 Does his endorsement mean that there are tangible benefits to running alongside the President, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to wait to navel-gaze when we have some navel gazing to look at.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, why did the White House --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ask Tommy on Wednesday, right?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s in Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did the White House find it worth its while to encourage Dede Scozzafava to endorse Bill Owens?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that what the candidate -- the former Republican nominee decided was -- and talked to, I\'m sure, both Republicans and Democrats both in New York and nationally, about who she thought was best suited to carry on the things that she cared about and believed in, and she decided that that candidate was the Democrat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Patrick Gaspard, from the White House, called her and talked to her, and helped arrange --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure Michael Steele and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Andrew Cuomo and others --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure Newt Gingrich -- sure, I mean --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just curious why the White House thought it was worth your while to get so deeply involved in that race if none of this really matters as far as 2010, or anything else.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are interesting -- I do think there are interesting tidbits that we see coming out of New York 23.\xc2\xa0 You see, the Republican Party having picked the candidate, elements of the Republican Party deciding they don\'t like that candidate and basically doing what they needed to do to get that candidate off the ballot.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a host of primaries that will affect 2010 next year that pit moderate Republican candidates and conservative Republican candidates.</p>\n<p>I think a lot of people decided that in a district that had sent Republicans to Congress, parts of that district, since the 1800s traditionally had sent moderate Republicans.\xc2\xa0 I think many in the Republican Party hung out a sign, as you heard people at the White House say this weekend, that moderates need not apply. I do think that has ramifications for next year because you\'ve got primaries that you all are and will cover that pit very similar elements of that argument against each other next year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of quick ones on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Karzai said today he wants to "Make sure that the taxpayers\' money coming to us from your countries" -- the United States and others, but let\'s just talk about the U.S. -- "is spent wisely and rightly by us."\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that standard is currently being met?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have made, obviously, important investments in the troops that we have put in Afghanistan, as well as through international assistance.\xc2\xa0 I think I would simply -- without getting into -- as I said earlier, not to go back too far in history, I think the President understands that for any of our efforts to be successful it\'s time for a new chapter in Afghan history.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can\'t say whether it\'s being -- that standard that he set is being met yet?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is anxious to see improvement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President need to visit Afghanistan before making his final decision on troops or strategy?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He would not?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not necessary?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President was in Afghanistan -- what, I guess sometime last July or June, I can\'t remember when the trip was.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it\'s necessary for the President to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And does he need any more information from the Joint Chiefs?\xc2\xa0 There was reporting Friday that he asked them for some specific data --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I said to Savannah, I think there\'s a -- there will be -- as we said Friday, there will be another meeting to go through additional recommendations that the Pentagon is working through.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will that meeting occur before he leaves for Asia?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Either early this week -- I\'m sorry, either late this week or early next week, but I assume before Asia, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 In meeting with Chancellor Merkel this morning and the European Commission officials this afternoon, will President Obama be making specific requests for additional help in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get a readout from the private meeting that the President -- if there is a readout on the private meeting that the President had with Chancellor Merkel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick follow.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, you said --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this, I think you all heard the President say -- and I would be remiss if I didn\'t repeat what the President said about the tremendous and important contributions that Germany in particular has made to NATO efforts in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you said that once he makes his decision he\'ll be walking the American people through it.\xc2\xa0 Are you planning an Oval Office address?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said this last week -- I think a question that Jeff asked -- we have not spent a ton of time on the actual -- on actually what that would look like except I know the President has told us -- not necessarily as it relates to some venue or some speech, but that it is important for the American people to understand why he made the decision that he\'s made.\xc2\xa0 And I anticipate that the President will spend some time walking the American people through the process that we\'ve undertaken and the decision points that he\'s made along the way to come to the ultimate conclusion that he\'s come to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more very quick thing, again, on timing -- and I know we\'re slicing this pretty thin, but if he may not meet with the Joint Chiefs until early next week, it sounds like a decision will wait until after Asia.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The only guidance that I have is to reiterate coming weeks.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more clear than that, I\'m sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, climate change is also a big issue for the European Union.\xc2\xa0 To what extent is the President using his personal powers of persuasion to talk to folks on the Hill, members of the Senate, on climate change in the fashion that he has been doing on health care?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I think he\'s obviously had an opportunity to meet with members of the Senate over the past few weeks.\xc2\xa0 I assume those conversations have included discussions on energy, and I think those conversations will continue as we seek to continue the progress that the House made in passing comprehensive energy and climate change legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But have there been any specific energy or climate change-related meetings or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get from Ben LaBolt and others what Carol Browner, what the EPA, the Department of Energy have done on this, and see the degree to which the President has also had individual conversations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then also on the elections today, you talked about interesting tidbits come out of New York.\xc2\xa0 To what extent is the President looking at the elections today in New York, Virginia, and New Jersey as a reflection of what Americans think about the job he is doing, and sort of to what extent is he looking at them to forecast ahead to what he and Democrats need to do in 2010?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I doubt the President disagrees with me in saying that I don\'t think these -- as I have said -- Mark -- each of the last three times we\'ve met, I don\'t think the President is looking at these and believes that they say anything about our future legislative efforts or our future political efforts.\xc2\xa0 Again, in 2001, President Bush lost Virginia and New Jersey.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe that it impacted his legislative initiatives going forward, and as I recall, happily sitting at one of the campaign committees in 2002, that the elections didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem unambiguous as to their results.\xc2\xa0 In 2005 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in any way on his performance?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would quote for you the pollster that -- from The Washington Post who asked specifically this question of the Virginia electorate; 70 percent said that their vote had nothing to do with the President.\xc2\xa0 Those that -- the other 30 percent that said their vote either had -- was intending to either show support for or opposition to the President, that number was evenly split.\xc2\xa0 And if anything, the illuminating number coming out of that is registered voters approved of the President\'s job among Virginians by a number of 57 percent, which exceeds by 5 the amount the President received in Virginia a year ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it shows -- your answer gets partway there -- that these political questions aren\xe2\x80\x99t about --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll be graded.\xc2\xa0 Mark, I got an incomplete from you, but as I work my way this way I\'m getting better, apparently.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\'s not over yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, these questions aren\xe2\x80\x99t about next year and the future and what it portends; it\'s about what the President has done for the last year since he won reelection.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that if Democrats win in any of these locations you won\'t stand there tomorrow and say, yes, the President gets some credit for that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What I\'m saying, again, as I said Monday and I said Friday, I know there\'s a great cottage industry in this lovely town that looks at what happens today and sees what it portends for next year -- hold on, hold on, let me -- I know, you\'ll find it incomplete, but it\'s my answer.\xc2\xa0 You know, we can do this, we can look at this and what it means, and I happen to honestly believe -- I know that\'s, gasp, get your notebook out, Gibbs honest -- (laughter) -- I don\'t believe that local elections in Virginia and New Jersey portend a lot about legislative success or political success in the future.\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Forget the future.\xc2\xa0 What does it mean for the people to think of what the President has done for the last year?\xc2\xa0 Is it a grade for the President in the last year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the question was asked specifically amongst a representative sample of those that will participate in the elections taking place today to elect the next governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, right?\xc2\xa0 That question very specifically resulted in 70 percent of the Virginia population -- I know, I hate to let fact get in the way of good navel-gazing, but that\'s just what the poll said.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t quote me.\xc2\xa0 Quote The Washington Post.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s an entirely different subject, apparently.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, considering the United States\' long engagement in Berlin, and President Kennedy\'s statement when he went there, why did this President decide he could not accept the invitation to go for the 20th anniversary of commemoration, like all the other leaders who helped control Berlin during the interim?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President obviously has talked a little bit about, in his remarks with Chancellor Merkel today, talked about the momentous events of almost 30 years ago -- I\'m sorry, almost 20 years ago -- with the fall of the wall.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have a lot to work on here and we have commitments for an upcoming Asia trip.\xc2\xa0 But soon a very senior delegation of American officials will be announced to go to that ceremony in Germany.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I do a quick follow-up on Ann?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Which one?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The one about the elections.\xc2\xa0 Are you asserting that the voters who go to the polls today who are feeling economic anxiety, who feel the country is on the wrong track, the Democrats who are not as enthusiastic today as they were a year ago -- none of that has any bearing on the President\'s performance at all?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t -- I\'m not sure exactly what some of that is -- what some of what you\'re premising your question on is based off of.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not suggesting there\'s not economic anxiety.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not suggesting that there\'s not frustration with Washington\'s inability to deal with fundamental problems in our society.\xc2\xa0 That\'s exactly what the President is working on each and every day:\xc2\xa0 to make health care more affordable; to create good-paying jobs; to create a new foundation for economic recovery through jobs in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>I\'m not saying there\'s not economic anxiety in this country. But again, if you look at what -- if you look at -- I\'m just reading what was written about the poll by the people conducting the poll, who talked to the voters about what they\'re saying and what they\'re feeling.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what about voter enthusiasm and the fact that it seems, at least anecdotally, we\'ll know it more at the end --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\'s discuss when we have something to base it more on than anecdote.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the President said in Massachusetts that Congress looks at local elections and they read tea leaves.\xc2\xa0 That being the case, if the Democrats go 0 for 3 today, why wouldn\'t Congress look at that and think maybe there\'s not that support --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\'s deal with hypotheticals tomorrow when we can decide whether somebody went 0 for 3 or 1 for 3, or whether a walk counted as not counting as an at-bat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just get the question out.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just get the question out.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you want me to wait for you to tell you what I\'m going to do with hypotheticals?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just try the question.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then you can tell me you\'re not going to answer.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If he goes 3 for 3, and they do really well, why isn\'t that in a sense a validation of the President\'s policies?\xc2\xa0 And why wouldn\'t Capitol Hill look at that and decide this is a strong President, politically in a good position, we want to get behind this agenda?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Should I do it now?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s wait and deal with hypotheticals tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Incomplete, incomplete.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s the best I can do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to switch to the economy -- and you might have touched on this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 When the Volcker board comes up with their recommendations and when you make decisions on those recommendations, does that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about the PERAB?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PERAB, yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that -- first of all, is that going to be before the budget, or I mean, is that going to be this year that you come up with this not stimulus two, but whatever you want to call it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe that one of the reasons, obviously, that the President wanted to have this quarterly meeting of his Economic Recovery Advisory Board focus on jobs was as we\'ve seen the beginnings of economic growth, we have to make sure that we\'re looking at and evaluating all ideas for creating an environment -- a better environment for creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think the suggestions that he got from individuals yesterday will be analyzed and looked at this year by our economic advisors here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- this year as part of coming up with individual proposals this year, or could they be part of the budget?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, they could be either.\xc2\xa0 They could be -- again, as I\'ve said, the President is constantly evaluating ideas for job creation, as well as for implementing in the budget.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he less inclined to make those recommendations add to the deficit?\xc2\xa0 We have the budget director today in New York talking about the importance of the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Is it possible that those -- the decisions that he makes on the next economic steps will be deficit-neutral?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that part of that is an evaluation that the economic team will have to make.\xc2\xa0 I think what one of the messages that Peter had in New York was, one way to -- the most important way in dealing with our federal deficit right now is to get our economy moving again.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the economic team is focused on, and that will have the most impact in the short term on that budget deficit.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions, one on the economy, then on the elections.\xc2\xa0 First, on the economy, a report saying nearly half of all U.S. children will be on food stamps; 90 percent of black children at some point during their childhood.\xc2\xa0 What say you about that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have not looked through the entire report.\xc2\xa0 I saw some news reports of what you just mentioned.\xc2\xa0 A couple things.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President has, in the recovery plan, worked to ensure that those that are struggling with our economy have the appropriate safety net that they need when they\'ve hit on hard times.\xc2\xa0 And an answer not dissimilar to what I just gave on the budget deficit, and that is the best way to address that problem is to get our economy moving and growing more consistently in a robust fashion.\xc2\xa0 We have -- we are more than a year removed from the events of last September and are almost two years into -- or two years away from, I should say, the official delineation of an economic recession that caused a huge economic slowdown and obviously has resulted on more and more people hitting on hard times and their ability to find work.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the election issue, and it\'s centered around today, via Michael Steele -- Michael Steele says there are -- these elections are competitive, but if indeed there are Democratic losses today, you can blame it on the fact that this President is overexposed, primarily on issues to include the health care debate.\xc2\xa0 Now, this is today.\xc2\xa0 This is not next year, this is not yesterday.\xc2\xa0 This is today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It was convoluted reasoning yesterday and it\'s convoluted reasoning today and tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute, but if the President -- I\'m sorry, Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if the President does lose these gubernatorial seats, what does that say to this administration on a year away from when --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\'ve asked Ann\'s question, and I would refer you to Ann\'s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann, by the way, I\'m trying to get an answer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I refer you to Ann\'s answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On health care, there is a public plan option as part of the House bill, a public plan option, a very different one, as part of the Senate bill.\xc2\xa0 Debate starts very soon in both houses. Which version of the public plan option does the President prefer?\xc2\xa0 Which one?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked specifically to the team about that.\xc2\xa0 The President, as I\'ve said in the past, will evaluate what comes to his desk for choice and competition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But before that, isn\'t it time for the President -- or important for the President at some point to say, "I prefer this one over that one"?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is very pleased with the progress that we\'re making in the approach that he\'s taken to get us to a point where --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'ll sign either one?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I -- now you\'re back to my first answer -- getting back to my first answer, which, I said, when that bill gets to our desk, we\'d be happy to evaluate it.</p>\n<p>Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s reported that the President is meeting with Senator Blanche Lincoln tonight, and I was wondering if there are similar scheduled meetings with Senator Joseph Lieberman or if the President has reached out to Senator Lieberman since he\'s expressed his concerns about the bill.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know of either no meetings -- neither meetings nor phone calls with the President and Senator Lieberman.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n1:31 P.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
