Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:04 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I hope you all had a good weekend.\xc2\xa0 As advertised, we are going to do a follow-up to the Zika briefing that we did at the top of a briefing here a couple of months ago.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m joined once again by Dr. Anne Schuchat from the Centers for Disease Control, and Dr. Tony Fauci, from the National Institute of Health.\xc2\xa0 Both of them will be able to provide you with an update on some additional information that we have learned about this virus and the risk that it poses to the American public.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll also be able to provide us some additional information about the funding request that the administration put forward to the United States Congress a couple of months ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs we discussed in the briefing last week, we have not seen the kind of response from Congress that we would expect, and frankly, we haven\'t seen the kind of response from Congress that is clearly in the interest of the safety and well-being of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And so both Dr. Schuchat and Dr. Fauci should be able to provide you some insight into how those resources will be used.</p>\n<p>\n\tEach of them will make brief opening statements, and then for questions on this topic, we\'ll do those at the top so that they can answer them and then we\'ll let them go.\xc2\xa0 And we can discuss the wide array of other topics that are likely to come up today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, Dr. Schuchat, why don\'t I turn it over to you first?</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. SCHUCHAT:\xc2\xa0 Thanks so much.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a pleasure to be here today.\xc2\xa0 Since we last discussed the Zika virus, we continue to be learning pretty much every day, and most of what we\'re learning is not reassuring.\xc2\xa0 We have learned that the virus is linked to a broader set of complications in pregnancy, not just the microcephaly, but also prematurity, eye problems and some other conditions.\xc2\xa0 We have learned that the mosquito vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is present in a broader range of states in the continential U.S..\xc2\xa0 So instead of about 12 states where the mosquito, Aedes aegypti is present, we believe about 30 states have the mosquito present.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve also learned that the virus is likely to be a problem at much of the pregnancy period, not just probably the first trimester but potentially throughout the pregnancy.\xc2\xa0 This information is, of course, of concern, and CDC has been working 24/7 to protect pregnant women, to support the state and local health departments that are that front line of defense, to learn as much as we can about the mosquito that can spread the virus and about the virus itself, and to work with other countries to learn what we may be seeing later in the continental U.S.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are quite concerned about Puerto Rico, where the virus is spreading throughout the island.\xc2\xa0 We think there could be hundreds of thousands of cases of Zika virus in Puerto Rico, and perhaps hundreds of affected babies.\xc2\xa0 We know that the pregnant women in Puerto Rico are very keen to protect themselves and to have community protection, and we\'re working closely with the authorities in Puerto Rico to support that response with mosquito control beginning and with the distribution of what we call Zika prevention kits for pregnant women.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve learned that mosquito transmission is the usual way that the virus can spread, but it also appears to be spread through sexual transmission, and that has meant we\'ve had to issue updated guidance for couples on how to prevent spread of the virus, particularly to pregnant women.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that we\'ve learned is that there is a resounding interest in preventing this disease and controlling it as well as we can.\xc2\xa0 Last week -- or on April 1st, the CDC and U.S. government convened a Zika Action Plan summit in Atlanta.\xc2\xa0 Leaders from more than 30 states and territories joined in Atlanta to do Zika action planning to get ready for mosquito season.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to do to increase laboratory diagnostic testing, to increase mosquito surveillance, to increase human surveillance and birth defect surveillance, and to improve our communication so people have the best information to protect themselves and their families.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on since we talked a couple weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll turn things over to Dr. Fauci.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. FAUCI:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, Anne.\xc2\xa0 And in a similar vein, since we spoke last, at the same week that the CDC had their summit in Atlanta we had a research meeting on Monday and Tuesday of that same week right in Rockville and North Bethesda. And to underscore what Dr. Schuchat said, we\'re learning more and more about this, and I\'m just giving you a very brief summary about that, but the more and more we learn, the more and more you get concerned about the scope of what this virus is doing.\xc2\xa0 Bottom line is we still have a lot to learn.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first thing was a very important study at the very fine, molecular level, looking at the virus and seeing if it is any different from dengue -- because the question we keep asking it\'s a flavivirus; it\'s transmitted by the same mosquito.\xc2\xa0 What is the difference between Zika and dengue?\xc2\xa0 And it looks really very much the same molecularly, except there\xe2\x80\x99s a very short, small run of amino acids -- namely, the building blocks of protein -- at the part of the virus that binds to cells.\xc2\xa0 So it may be that that\xe2\x80\x99s the clue of why it acts different, particularly being neurotropic, or being -- having a propensity to infect neurological tissue.</p>\n<p>\n\tGood news is that we developed two animal models, two mouse models since we spoke last.\xc2\xa0 And again, the mouse models underscore what Dr. Schuchat said, because when you infect a mouse, there\xe2\x80\x99s a very strong propensity to infect neurological tissue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve developed a monkey model, which is interesting because the monkey now -- you can get a monkey pregnant and look at the difference between the virus in a pregnant monkey and a monkey who\xe2\x80\x99s not pregnant.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- and this is just preliminary data but it\xe2\x80\x99s really quite scintillating -- is that the virus stays around the blood significantly longer in the pregnant monkey than it does in the non-pregnant.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that\xe2\x80\x99s important -- you might remember we had a case here of a Washington resident who was infected during pregnancy, affected the fetus, and that person had weeks of viremia, which is very unusual because viremia only usually lasts a couple of days.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, the neurological issues are important.\xc2\xa0 In vitro studies of getting the virus and putting it in neural stem cells showing that it has a very strong propensity to destroy tissue, which could explain why besides interfering with the development of a fetus, it might directly attack brain tissue, even when the fetus is later on in the period of gestation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also are continuing with the vaccine studies that I mentioned to you.\xc2\xa0 I told you that we would very likely have our first vaccine candidate in phase one in September.\xc2\xa0 That looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s on time.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re producing it in our pilot plant outside of Bethesda, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to then be processing it to be able to get it through the FDA to put into a human.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then finally, we have a screening program for drugs that I mentioned to you.\xc2\xa0 We hadn\xe2\x80\x99t screened any drugs the last time we spoke; we\xe2\x80\x99ve now screened about 62 drugs and have 15 of them that have some degree of activity.\xc2\xa0 Caution:\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they\xe2\x80\x99re going to turn out to be good drugs, but they do have some activity.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in summary, a lot of things have gone on, things that are pointing to serious issues that we need to address.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned an awful lot since we spoke, and we really do need to learn a lot more.\xc2\xa0 Because this is a very unusual virus that we can\xe2\x80\x99t even pretend that we know everything about it that we need to know.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Doctor, you mentioned you expected there to be hundreds of thousands of cases in Puerto Rico.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a prediction or a range of how many you expect in the United States broadly?</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. SCHUCHAT:\xc2\xa0 You know, much of our predictions come from what we saw with dengue virus and chikungunya virus, and those two viruses are also spread by the same mosquito.\xc2\xa0 In Puerto Rico, they ranged between 25 and 80 percent of the population getting infected with one or the other of those viruses over the course of one or multiple seasons.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the continental U.S., those -- we have seen travel-associated cases of chikungunya and dengue.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen large numbers, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen thousands of cases of locally transmitted disease from the mosquitoes.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen dozens of cases.\xc2\xa0 But we absolutely need to be ready.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Dr. Fauci was saying, everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially thought.\xc2\xa0 And so while we absolutely hope we don\xe2\x80\x99t see widespread local transmission in the continental U.S., we need the states to be ready for that.\xc2\xa0 And that was part of what our summit was about\xc2\xa0 -- learning all they could about mosquito control, what do we know, what do we now know, what can we do with the tools that we have today, and how to get ready for mosquito season; when they have a case of travel-associated, how to look around that individual for the mosquitoes nearby.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe really want the traveling public, when they come back from the Caribbean or Latin America, to use repellant for the couple weeks after they return, because if they silently got Zika infection and they get bit by a mosquito in the continental U.S., that mosquito can then spread the virus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect there to be large outbreaks in the continental U.S.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t give a number to how many cases, but I can say that we can\'t assume we\'re not going to have a big problem.\xc2\xa0 We know with other viruses we\'ve had bigger problems than we expected, so we\'re taking this very seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that number is for regions in the world?</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. SCHUCHAT:\xc2\xa0 What we know from the other viruses is that 25 to 80 percent of the population may get the infection.\xc2\xa0 We know, for instance, in Puerto Rico right now they\'re have dengue virus, as well as the Zika virus at the same time.\xc2\xa0 So that makes it even more difficult to tease out what\'s causing a person\'s fever and rash.\xc2\xa0 So I would say that in Latin America we know they\'re at risk for very high attack rates of the virus.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of pregnant women, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet when you have Zika virus infection during pregnancy, what percent of the time the baby will be totally normal and what percent of the time there will be a complication.\xc2\xa0 That\'s one of the most important questions for us to answer, and teams are working in Colombia, in Brazil, in Panama trying to answer that question, because that\'s the most important question for pregnant women.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Fauci, two for you.\xc2\xa0 One, can you tell me more about the Zika prevention kits and what that entails?\xc2\xa0 And for Dr. Schuchat, how concerned should American athletes be that may be traveling to Brazil, especially as the Olympics come?\xc2\xa0 Are we working on something specifically for Americans that may have it?\xc2\xa0 And I guess I should ask you also another one, Dr. Fauci, about resources.\xc2\xa0 Are you confident that you have what you need to maintain this --</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. FAUCI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll answer that question and get the prevention kit to Dr. Schuchat, because that is a CDC thing.\xc2\xa0 The answer is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have what I need right now.\xc2\xa0 What I\'ve done is take money from other areas of non-Zika research to start.\xc2\xa0 We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just stop and wait for the money; we had to go ahead for it.\xc2\xa0 The only trouble is, if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get the money that the President has asked for, we\'re not going to be able to take it to the point where we\'ve actually accomplished what we need to do.\xc2\xa0 So the answer is, we really don\xe2\x80\x99t have what we need, but we\'re still going full blast by drawing money from other areas, and that\'s how we started.\xc2\xa0 The money that\'s being transferred over from the Ebola account will help bring us a little bit further, but it\'s still not what we want.\xc2\xa0 When the President asked for $1.9 billion, we needed $1.9 billion.</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. SCHUCHAT:\xc2\xa0 The Zika prevention kits are being given out to pregnant women in the areas where the virus is already spreading.\xc2\xa0 So in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, there have been about 5,000 kits distributed so far.\xc2\xa0 They include insect repellant.\xc2\xa0 They include information about how women can protect themselves.\xc2\xa0 They include condoms, because we know that the virus can be spread sexually, not just through mosquitos.\xc2\xa0 They include vouchers for screening materials to help people make sure the mosquitos stay outside the home and not inside the home, and those sorts of things.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe actually initially were considering putting in some permethrin-treated clothing, but then some of our surveillance for mosquito resistance in Puerto Rico revealed that permethrin probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t effective, so we didn\xe2\x80\x99t end up including that kind of treated clothing.\xc2\xa0 But they\'re essentially materials and information to help women protect themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of the athletes, we know the Olympics is just a wonderful event and that athletes have been training for their whole lives to go there.\xc2\xa0 We really want to make sure people know that if they\'re pregnant, they should defer travel.\xc2\xa0 We also want people to know that travel to the area may lead to silent infections or infections with symptoms, and that following infections it\'s very important to take precautions during sex not to spread the virus.\xc2\xa0 So that type of information has been shared with the Olympic Committee, and of course the CDC is working closely with the Olympic Medical Committee about further advice.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Angela.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 For the doctors, are you concerned that by transferring the money from the already appropriated funds last week, that it reduces the urgency on Congress to appropriate new funds?</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. FAUCI:\xc2\xa0 Well, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, because as I just said, it is not enough for us to get the job done.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\'s just a temporary stopgap.\xc2\xa0 If you look at what we need to do both at the CDC and at the NIH, we have a lot of work to do, and that may, in some people\'s minds, kind of lessen the intensity of it. But in our minds, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, because we still don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough to do what we need to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. SCHUCHAT:\xc2\xa0 I was just going to say that we also feel a sense of urgency about Ebola and the global health security agenda.\xc2\xa0 Ebola is still circulating in Liberia and Guinea, and many of the vulnerable countries in Africa are having outbreaks right now.\xc2\xa0 And so we know that we have to be, as a country, ready to support response to more than one outbreak at a time.\xc2\xa0 We think that\'s really important.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re working as quickly and as deeply as we can on the Zika response, while continuing to support Ebola response and recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We heard the Zika virus is coming to the United States, expecting it summer or fall.\xc2\xa0 Is there any sort of mosquito forecast, any way of knowing if it\'s going to be a worse year than usual for mosquitos in general?\xc2\xa0 And also, what are you telling travelers, people who are going to some of these countries and returning?\xc2\xa0 Should they be tested?\xc2\xa0 And where can that be done?</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. SCHUCHAT:\xc2\xa0 The issue of mosquito surveillance and prediction is a really great question.\xc2\xa0 And one of the problems in the past decade or so is that we\'ve really let our mosquito control efforts wither away, and so we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the great information that we\'d like to have, or even the ability to do better modeling about where in the country the problems are going to be and when they might occur.\xc2\xa0 So strengthening mosquito surveillance before you have to get human disease is a priority for us.\xc2\xa0 So that is something that we\'re working on.\xc2\xa0 And I think with more resources, we could do a better job.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m forgetting what the second part of the question was.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Testing --</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. SCHUCHAT:\xc2\xa0 Oh, testing people -- right.\xc2\xa0 Yeah, we do think that if you come back from an area where Zika is spreading and you\'re pregnant, we recommend that you be tested whether you were symptomatic or not.\xc2\xa0 We recommend testing in the first trimester and again in the third trimester.\xc2\xa0 In terms of people who don\xe2\x80\x99t have symptoms, we don\xe2\x80\x99t think they need to be tested -- who aren\xe2\x80\x99t pregnant -- but we think that they do need to take precautions with sexual contact, particularly in terms of sex with a pregnant woman.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'ve put out updated guidance on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe know a lot of couples were asking, well, I\'m not pregnant but I want to get pregnant, and how long do I have to wait?\xc2\xa0 So we put out guidance on that as well, about waiting an eight-week period following travel before trying to conceive for women.\xc2\xa0 And waiting a longer period for men who have symptoms, or in terms of the potential that men can have persistent virus in the semen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dr. Schuchat, you think these Zika prevention kits would be useful in mainland United States?\xc2\xa0 And also, do you have any projection on the spread of the Zika virus in Puerto Rico?\xc2\xa0 And to Dr. Fauci, what happens when the stopgap runs out?</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. SCHUCHAT:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we do think the Zika prevention kits may be helpful in some part of the U.S.\xc2\xa0 And there was a lot of interest in them from the state health departments that attended the summit.\xc2\xa0 One of the issues to consider is the living conditions -- do people have screens, do they have air conditioning.\xc2\xa0 We heard that in parts of Key West it\'s very similar to Puerto Rico -- people like the windows open and they like that breeze.\xc2\xa0 And so that idea of protecting yourself from mosquitos that can live inside the house may be relevant here.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then the second question -- it was for you.\xc2\xa0 Okay, good.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And projection of the spread in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. SCHUCHAT:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got a team working closely in Puerto Rico trapping mosquitos and looking at where the mosquitos are that are potentially of concern.\xc2\xa0 They\'re also testing for resistance, and then the human surveillance.\xc2\xa0 And we are seeing it in multiple parts of the island.\xc2\xa0 And it may be that the cases we\'re seeing reported on just a small percentage because we think some people can be asymptomatic -- not have symptoms.\xc2\xa0 And the only people that are being tested right now are people who come in with symptoms.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re seeing it increasing across the island.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re worried that as it gets even warmer, it\'s going to be island-wide.</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. FAUCI:\xc2\xa0 To be honest here, I can\'t imagine that we\'re not going to be given the money when we\'ve reached the point where every time we come in front of you, we tell you things that are more serious.\xc2\xa0 So if we reach the point where the stopgap money runs out, again, hopefully that will never happen, but we\'re going to have to start raiding other accounts.\xc2\xa0 And very important research on other diseases is going to suffer, and suffer badly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I just almost can\'t imagine that that would happen, because as we keep talking more, I mean, we just spoke to you about the very interesting issue that we\'re learning.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not an alarmist, and most of you who know me know that I\'m not.\xc2\xa0 But the more we learn about the neurological aspects, the more we look around and say, this is very serious.\xc2\xa0 I mean, just in the last couple of weeks, we know not only do you have Guillain-Barr\xc3\xa9, but you have a case of an acute myelitis, you have a meningoencephalitis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then you have this new thing that was just recently described -- we need to get more of the cases that it really is associated -- called, ADEM, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, which is a multiple sclerosis-type of an involvement in the brain.\xc2\xa0 Thankfully, it tends to resolve the way Guillain-Barr\xc3\xa9 resolves.\xc2\xa0 But again, every time we look, we see more and more.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in the context of your question, I can\'t imagine, as we learn more and more things that are troublesome, that all of a sudden we\'re not going to get the money.\xc2\xa0 We really do have to get it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dr. Fauci, how did this seem to catch us so by surprise?</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. FAUCI:\xc2\xa0 It caught us by surprise not in the sense of what we should of known -- because for essentially, since the virus was first recognized in 1947 and the first human cases were 1952, it was a relatively inconsequential virus in the sense of a rather mild illness, virtually no mortality, no hints or signals of other things that we\'re seeing now.\xc2\xa0 For example, the microcephaly, the congenital abnormalities, or Guillain-Barr\xc3\xa9.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what happened?\xc2\xa0 And we don\xe2\x80\x99t have all the answers to this -- when it then had its first outbreak, and the first outbreak was in the Yap Islands, that when things started to explode.\xc2\xa0 And we still didn\xe2\x80\x99t get all the information from them. And only when it hit a vulnerable, big population with a lot of mosquitos, with people who have never exposed to this before, did we then start seeing the unfolding of this scenario that every week, every month, it tends to surprise us even more.\xc2\xa0 But the initial part of it, there was really no reason to be very suspicious that this would be bad.\xc2\xa0 It was one of those viruses that just gave a mild illness.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the $1.9 billion that House Chairman Rogers said that -- they plan to continue to monitor this and then fund it as needed.\xc2\xa0 Why is that approach not appropriate for this virus?\xc2\xa0 Why do you need that $1.9 billion up front as a big bulk of money versus getting it as this progresses and it goes forward?\xc2\xa0 And when is it going to be too late?\xc2\xa0 Is it the first bite of local transmission?\xc2\xa0 Or is it some other point when you start to see those numbers swell?</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. SCHUCHAT:\xc2\xa0 I think, as Dr. Fauci said, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been waiting for the money to act, because this is so serious.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been surging our laboratory testing, for instance -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a big backlog on that laboratory testing.\xc2\xa0 To really scale up takes time.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so knowing that resources are coming helps with the scale-up.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of commercial partners that are needed for that scale-up.\xc2\xa0 Will they actually help without knowing that resources are coming?\xc2\xa0 The vector control -- yes, we have enough money to start on that, but that\xe2\x80\x99s an expensive undertaking, the mosquito-control efforts.\xc2\xa0 And, as I said, we\xe2\x80\x99re learning that not all the chemicals or pesticides that are out there will work.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are multi-year studies that are going to be needed for these babies.\xc2\xa0 Because we really don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether a child that looks healthy at birth will actually not have the effect of the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s longer-term studies that are going to be needed.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what I would say is that people are acting intensively right now, but that we can\xe2\x80\x99t -- if additional resources aren\xe2\x80\x99t coming, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to commit to the long-term work that\xe2\x80\x99s needed.</p>\n<p>\n\tThen the other thing is the places that the resources were taken from were areas where important work was going on.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99re quite vulnerable if we\xe2\x80\x99re not able to meet the commitments on the global health security or the Ebola response and recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. FAUCI:\xc2\xa0 Yes, just -- what Anne said, but also, something that I mentioned to this group the last time we were here, that we have a very important partnership with pharmaceutical companies.\xc2\xa0 And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t perceive us as a reliable partner, they tend to back off a bit.\xc2\xa0 And that would be the worst thing, because we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to develop these countermeasures completely on our own.\xc2\xa0 So we need to partner with them.\xc2\xa0 And they would get mistrustful if we say, okay, trust us, we\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the money later.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work in industry -- \xe2\x80\x9cTrust us, we\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the money later.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you seeing any hesitation from industry partners since that money hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come through yet?</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. FAUCI:\xc2\xa0 Well, the answer is, thankfully, not yet.\xc2\xa0 But I have considerable experience -- as some of you may have remembered, back in the time when we were building countermeasures for bio-defense, when we were trying to get vaccines for anthrax and things like that -- we were trying to bring companies in, and unless we really had the money up front, that they knew that we were going to be a reliable partner.\xc2\xa0 Many of the important companies backed out.\xc2\xa0 I really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see that now when we need a vaccine and other countermeasures so desperately.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other part of my question was, when will it be too late?</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. SCHUCHAT:\xc2\xa0 We held our summit with the health departments on April 1st because we know that mosquito season is coming and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to wait for money for them to get plans done.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to actually develop mosquito-control efforts, surveillance and a lot of difficult tasks.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo knowing that there is some resources now is helpful.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re frustrated because some of the resources are coming from other programs that they have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe problem here is that the mosquitoes come, people get infected, and then it\xe2\x80\x99s several months before the baby is born.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re really trying to protect every pregnant woman we can right now.\xc2\xa0 So we have this double whammy of you see the febrile illness now; you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the horrible effects on the child many months from now.\xc2\xa0 And we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to wait for that, we need to act before then.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First question, Dr. Fauci.\xc2\xa0 You said in the beginning that you were moving money around right now.\xc2\xa0 Where is that money coming from?\xc2\xa0 And the second question is, is there abstinence information in the Zika kits?</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. FAUCI:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 With regard to the moving money around, when you have -- the fiscal year is going to end at the end of September, and we have money that\xe2\x80\x99s planned for other things -- that could be malaria, that could be tuberculosis -- and we have that money that is going to go into the projects that are going to just continue to progress the way they are.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re taking that money and now spending it on Zika, and if we don\xe2\x80\x99t refurbish that money, those programs are going to stop when they reach the point when they run out of money.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do is keep everything going.\xc2\xa0 But you reach a point when you don\xe2\x80\x99t come in and backfill it that things stop.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was referring to -- of my concern.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are those programs?</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. FAUCI:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are several.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you what we likely would do -- one of them would be malaria, the other thing would be universal flu vaccine, the other one would be tuberculosis.\xc2\xa0 Things like that.</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. SCHUCHAT:\xc2\xa0 The guidance that we\xe2\x80\x99ve issued for pregnant women and for couples in terms of preventing the sexual spread of Zika virus include both condoms and abstinence.\xc2\xa0 The actual wording in the materials for Puerto Rico I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of, because I know we were doing focus testing for the appropriate way to message.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dr. Fauci, can you tell us a little more about -- rightfully, you insist about women want to become pregnant and pregnancy -- can you just tell us a little more about neurological disorder, the Guillan-Barr\xc3\xa9 Syndrome?\xc2\xa0 And how dangerous is it for the rest of the population?\xc2\xa0 And at what point will it be necessary to tell people, try to avoid going south?</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. FAUCI:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll address the part about the neurological and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll have Dr. Schuchat talk about what recommendations likely may or may not come out.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe issue is we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing these case reports of things that we had not seen before with other similar viruses.\xc2\xa0 I mentioned the acute myelitis in a young person, an 81-year-old man who developed meningoencephalitis, and now the two cases of what they\xe2\x80\x99re calling ADEM.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the denominator is of that.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why you do these prospective cohort studies and you do surveillance studies, which the CDC and others are trying to get exactly what is the extent of that?\xc2\xa0 Are these just outlier cases, or when you look very carefully, are you going to see a lot of them?</p>\n<p>\n\tThe concern we\xe2\x80\x99re having is that at the same time we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the clinical manifestations in people, everything that we do in an animal model or in an in-vitro cell line is bad news.\xc2\xa0 The most recent of -- one, when they put Zika virus into neural stem cells, they have these things called organoids, which are kind of a psudo-brain formation, get completely destroyed by the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 And then they have a variety of other things that are related to the neurological system.\xc2\xa0 It appears to be very toxically neurotropic, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s concerning.</p>\n<p>\n\tHow that relates to how many of the clinical cases we\xe2\x80\x99ll see, we just have to keep our surveillance up.</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. SCHUCHAT:\xc2\xa0 Just in terms of the additional travel guidance, we base our updated guidance on the best information we have.\xc2\xa0 At this point, we have enhanced travel recommendations for pregnant women, saying that they defer travel or consider deferring travel.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t promise that we would never have broader recommendations, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll base it on the best information we have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo far, Guillain-Barr\xc3\xa9 Syndrome in the background, or the general population, is fairly rare.\xc2\xa0 If this is truly causing an increase, it still may be relatively uncommon, and so an individual needs that information, but it may not lead to us saying \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 John, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one then we\xe2\x80\x99ll let the doctors go.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Schuchat, you mentioned spread of the epidemic in Puerto Rico, its seriousness.\xc2\xa0 Now there have been reports from Haiti that it\xe2\x80\x99s growing very seriously, and that the problem is compounded by a reluctance of people to report and say what problem they have at medical centers.\xc2\xa0 What precisely are you doing with Haiti, given its proximity to the United States?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDR. SCHUCHAT:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 You know, Haiti is a key country for us.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been working closely with authorities in Haiti since before the earthquake and following the earthquake on intensive support for the public health system there.\xc2\xa0 We share a concern about Haiti, though -- the mosquitoes are there, the virus is there, and the population is quite vulnerable.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we do have a CDC country office in Haiti that\xe2\x80\x99s working together with the authorities.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s essentially the same principle as what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in Puerto Rico -- that people need to be protected against mosquitoes, particularly pregnant women.\xc2\xa0 And of course, care is not really going to be as strong there.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific treatment, but you know if you got Guillain-Barr\xc3\xa9 Syndrome in Haiti, it would be quite difficult.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we share the concern and are working with our CDC counterparts there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Doctors, for coming.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully all that is useful.\xc2\xa0 And I suspect it\xe2\x80\x99s probably not the last time that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have Doctors Schuchat and Fauci here to talk to us about this important issue.\xc2\xa0 But hopefully, it also is -- serves as motivation for members of Congress to pay careful attention to this top priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, though, Kathleen, we can get back to our regularly scheduled programming here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to check on two topics.\xc2\xa0 First, we have a story out today about an AP FOIA request that was related to USAID\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter operation in Cuba -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that story --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I anticipated you may ask about it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So AP got some emails that they requested via FOIA last week, and that\xe2\x80\x99s two years after the FOIA was filed.\xc2\xa0 And the story quotes a former USAID official saying that the organization sort of planned on this delay as a way to manage the fallout (inaudible) the program.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering how that kind of two-year delay squares with the administration\xe2\x80\x99s claim that it\xe2\x80\x99s the most transparent in history, and if you have any concerns that agencies are sort of intentionally using delays to slow-walk requests, and that some requests become basically useless because the information is returned two years later.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed in a much more high-profile setting, the individual agencies are responsible for responding to individual Freedom of Information Act requests that they receive from journalists or members of the public.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the guidelines the administration has put forward make clear that a genuine effort to have a bias toward openness and transparency is the approach that we would expect agencies to use when fulfilling these requests.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, they have a wide range of factors to consider when being responsive to Freedom of Information Act requests, but last year I think is a pretty good measure that 91 percent of the responses that were provided to Freedom of Information Act requests included some or all of the information that was requested.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that across the administration, the response that you see is consistent with the approach that the administration as a whole strongly supports.</p>\n<p>\n\tI can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the details of this particular case, because, ultimately, it was the responsibility of that agency to comply with that request.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what merited a two-year delay, or whether or not a two-year delay actually was merited.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the agency for the answer to that precise question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And separately, I wanted to go back to a comment the President made in the Fox News Sunday interview that ran yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He said his worst mistake was \xe2\x80\x9cprobably failing to plan for the day after what I think was the right thing to do in intervening in Libya.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I just wondered if you could kind of expand on that.\xc2\xa0 It was only sort of one sentence, but it seemed sort of meaningful.\xc2\xa0 What exactly does he see as his mistake?\xc2\xa0 And who does he blame for it?\xc2\xa0 And is he saying that he personally should have done more planning, or the U.S. should have done more planning with allies?\xc2\xa0 Or what exactly is the gist of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President talked about this issue a little bit more in his most recent address to the United Nations at the General Assembly there.\xc2\xa0 In that speech, the President noted that \xe2\x80\x9cOur coalition\xe2\x80\x9d -- I\xe2\x80\x99m quoting now -- \xe2\x80\x9ccould have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, the situation in Libya was quite unique.\xc2\xa0 You had the Qaddafi regime massing forces prepared to carry out an act of violence against a substantial and defenseless population.\xc2\xa0 And the international community, led by the United States, responded to prevent a good portion of that violence.\xc2\xa0 And that obviously was a good thing.\xc2\xa0 Lives were saved.\xc2\xa0 Many lives were saved.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what is also true, and what is unique to Libya, is that they had a totalitarian dictator in power for 42 years.\xc2\xa0 And the civil society and governing structures of that country atrophied. And it meant that once that dictator had been removed from power, that the regular structures that are typically in place in a country were not there to govern the country, or to at least ensure some measure of stability in that country until a government could be rebuilt and until security could be restored.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the unique confluence of events -- the need for emergent action on the part of the international community -- and governing structures that just didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist led to a scenario where the right decision was made at the beginning to prevent significant loss of life, at least in that specific instance.\xc2\xa0 But the rest of the international community did not have time and did not succeed in following through with the plan to compensate for the vacuum that was left behind.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think in some ways you could say that the President has tried to apply this lesson in considering the use of military in other circumstances; that asking the question about what situation will prevail and what sort of commitments from the international community will be required after that military intervention has been ordered by the Commander-in-Chief.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that I think, looking back, at least in the words of the President in his conversation with Mr. Wallace, is something that he regrets that the United States and the rest of the members of our coalition didn\xe2\x80\x99t do as it pertains to Libya.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on that sort of notion then, Secretary Carter said that the President is going to be asking for more money to help stabilize, rebuild -- economic aid for Iraq when he goes to this Gulf conference next week.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is that part of what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do there?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any details on how much aid? And is this part of some -- getting a more solid long-term commitment from allies?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is traveling to Saudi Arabia next week, where he will be meeting with many of our GCC partners who are making important contributions to our counter-ISIL coalition.\xc2\xa0 The focal point of our strategy all along has been building up the capacity of the government in Iraq, and eventually the government in Syria, to unite the country to confront the threat that they face from extremists.\xc2\xa0 And there will be a series of discussions about what additional steps our coalition can take to press the case against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m confident that there will be a discussion about what additional commitments our GCC partners, in particular, can make to that ongoing effort.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any details about that conversation to preview right now, but that\'s certainly something that we can talk about a little bit more next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, why is the President meeting with Fed Chair Yellen today?\xc2\xa0 What does he expect to get out of that meeting and what is the reason for the timing of it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, the President has met periodically over the last couple of years with Fed Chair Janet Yellen.\xc2\xa0 This is not something that they do regularly.\xc2\xa0 I think the last one-on-one meeting they had was in late 2014, so it\'s been a little more than a year since they had a one-on-one meeting.\xc2\xa0 Chair Yellen did participate in the meeting that the President convened earlier this year with financial regulators across the government.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, the Fed plays an important regulatory role, and she participated in the meeting, accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe goal of the conversation I think, frankly, is just to discuss the current trajectory of the U.S. economy but also the global economy.\xc2\xa0 I\'m confident that there will be an additional discussion of some regulatory issues, as well.\xc2\xa0 And the President has talked quite a bit about how his top domestic priority is expanding economic opportunity for the middle class, and obviously pursuing that policy priority involves having a sort of broad understanding of current economic conditions.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Chair Yellen spends a lot of time examining those conditions and making her own independent policy decisions.\xc2\xa0 And so it\'s an opportunity for them in some ways to trade notes on something that they\xe2\x80\x99re both looking at quite carefully even if the Fed Chair will continue to make the kinds of independent decisions that we believe are critical to the successful functioning of our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A long process went into the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to appoint Janet Yellen a couple years ago.\xc2\xa0 Is he happy with that choice?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s an interesting question.\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\'t want to say something that would implicitly call into question her independence.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President has been pleased with the way that she has fulfilled what is a critically important job, both as it relates to making policy decisions that have a significant impact not just on the U.S. economy but on the global economy, but also making sure that the Fed is following through on the important regulatory responsibilities that they have.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, hopefully, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave anybody with the impression that there is anything less than the utmost respect for the independent nature of her role in the decisions that she must make.\xc2\xa0 But I think that, independently, people across the ideological spectrum, at least when it comes to politics, would acknowledge that she has filled this very important role quite well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And separately, is the White House concerned about the state of events in Ukraine after the Prime Minister stepped down on Sunday -- concerned about the pace of reform that otherwise was going on there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, the administration has been concerned about the situation in Ukraine for quite some time now. And obviously, Mr. Yatsenyuk has played an important role throughout this process.\xc2\xa0 As his country has gone through such significant turmoil, he\xe2\x80\x99s played an important role in trying to help his country weather those challenges, and he obviously has been an important partner with the United States as we have tried to provide support to our friends in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis would explain why the Vice President of the United States telephoned Mr. Yatsenyuk yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously are pleased that he has indicated he will remain on to ensure a smooth transition to his successor. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tImplementing key economic reforms in Ukraine is going to be critical to that nation\xe2\x80\x99s long-term success, and the economic environment in that country right now is different and has certainly not been aided by the actions of the Russians to destabilize that country and to violate their territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the people of Ukraine and the nation of Ukraine is enduring quite a lot.\xc2\xa0 The United States will continue to stand with them and support them as they endure these challenges.\xc2\xa0 But that also means that the government of Ukraine will need to follow through on the critical economic reforms of which you alluded to, and we\'re hopeful that the commitment to implementing those reforms will continue in the mind of Mr. Yatsenyuk\xe2\x80\x99s successor.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When did the administration begin its review of the declassification of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9c28 pages,\xe2\x80\x9d the last chapter of the 9/11 Report?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Bill, for the details related to the declassification process I\'d actually refer you to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\xc2\xa0 His office is responsible for these kinds of declassification exercises, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll make the necessary decisions about which of the materials and how much of the materials can be declassified.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the President has made clear that trying to prevent bureaucratic over-classification is something that we\'ve identified as a policy priority.\xc2\xa0 And there are a number of steps that we have taken in recent years to make clear that that is a priority even in a national security context where classified material -- preserving classified material is entirely legitimate.</p>\n<p>\n\tA couple of examples of that -- the first is the administration did support the declassification of the key elements of the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s report on the former CIA interrogation program.\xc2\xa0 This is what\xe2\x80\x99s often referred to as the RDI report.\xc2\xa0 And there was a vigorous debate both in the intelligence community but also in Congress about whether or not key elements of that report should be declassified, and the administration did support the release of a declassified version of that report.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other example that I can cite -- and this is something that we\'ve been talking about for the last few weeks -- which is the commitment that the administration has made to making public instances in which noncombatants are killed in counterterrorism operations overseas.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some more work to be done on this, but this is something that Lisa Monaco, the President\xe2\x80\x99s top counterterrorism advisor, discussed in a speech recently.\xc2\xa0 And so we would anticipate that we\'ll have more news about how that information will be released in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think it does reflect the important progress that we\'ve made over the course of the administration.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, Bill, that in the early years of this administration that individuals who were standing where I\'m standing wouldn\'t even acknowledge that those counterterrorism operations were taking place.\xc2\xa0 But now you have a situation where the administration is laying out a key system for not just acknowledging that those operations took place, but also disclosing more detail about the consequences of those actions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to this particular case.\xc2\xa0 Do you know when the declassification effort began?\xc2\xa0 Because in the NSC statement today, they say that they hope to have it done by the end of the administration.\xc2\xa0 How long is it supposed to take when you have members of the 9/11 Commission, at least three of them, and two former members of intelligence committees, and according to former Congressman Roemer, even the Saudis say that it should be declassified?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill, I haven\'t seen the 28 pages and I don\'t know what they contain, so I\'m just not in a position to explain what the factors are in their ongoing review.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know when that process began.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- it will take until the end of the administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, it may, but without having seen those materials it\'s hard for me to explain whether it will or why it would if it does come to that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, because you did mention the 9/11 Commission -- there is an independent investigation that was conducted into 9/11.\xc2\xa0 You had experts who had previously served in government who led this effort, and they did release a report that was declassified.\xc2\xa0 So we do have -- when I say \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean the public does have a lot of insight into what led to the attacks of 9/11 and what steps were taken to try to counter -- prevent it from happening again.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think the last chapter of that report was never really --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a separate report.\xc2\xa0 This is a report that was put together by Congress.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, that report has not been released, but it is currently being reviewed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for a potential release.\xc2\xa0 But I just don\'t have an update on their ongoing efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President support the release of this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that the President has reviewed those 28 pages.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President certainly does support being as transparent as possible, but he also believes that these national security officials have an important job to do to make sure that if secrets need to be kept that they can be. So I don\'t know that the President has voiced an opinion in this particular case, but we can check on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If all of these people who have read the report -- or many of them -- suggest that it should be released, then what\xe2\x80\x99s the hang-up?\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are people who have seen the classified information, they know what\xe2\x80\x99s in it, and according to Roemer, even the Saudi government supports it.\xc2\xa0 So why the hang-up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill, I think that we have seen -- there have been some high-profile examples in the news recently of how well-intentioned, patriotic national security professionals can arrive at different conclusions about what information can be made public without damaging our national security, and what information must be withheld.\xc2\xa0 And this is always part of a vigorous bureaucratic debate.\xc2\xa0 And I know that \xe2\x80\x9cbureaucratic\xe2\x80\x9d often has a negative connotation.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t necessarily mean it that way.\xc2\xa0 I just mean that there are well-intentioned individuals with different points of view who can arrive at different conclusions, or at least engage in a debate that leaves them on different sides of that debate about what information can be made public without risking U.S. national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I can\'t speak to the nature of the debate in this instance because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read the 28 pages, but the President is certainly hopeful that this is something that they can resolve, consistent with a widely shared view about the need to be transparent but also the need to protect secrets that are critical to our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tPam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The review has been going on, I believe, since 2014, so why does it take two years to review 28 pages?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, Pam, I haven\'t read the pages so I don\'t know what\xe2\x80\x99s in it, but you can try to check with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence who will oversee that process, is overseeing that process, and maybe will provide you some greater insight into what kinds of factors are affecting the ultimate decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President bound by the outcome of that review?\xc2\xa0 Could he decide on his own to say, I\'m going to release it anyway despite what you\'re recommending?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I know that people often discuss the fact that the President does have the ability to decide on his own what information can be declassified.\xc2\xa0 But obviously there is a process in place to consider the various points of view of releasing sensitive national security information.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, there was a conclusion reached that this information can be released without damaging national security.\xc2\xa0 In other situations, there conclusion was reached that the information can\'t be released because, for example, it could reveal sources and methods through which information is obtained.\xc2\xa0 So the need to protect those sources and methods is often a justification for not releasing information.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not that\'s relevant in the context of this specific decision, because I haven\'t reviewed the 28 pages.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the information included evidence or indications that the Saudi government or other institutions in Saudi Arabia had some sort of support for the hijackers, would the President feel that he could release that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a hypothetical that\'s hard to address from here.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not that applies in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of the Wall Street reform, the President said when he had Janet Yellen here in early March that Wall Street reform has worked.\xc2\xa0 Today, there was another settlement as a result of the financial meltdown.\xc2\xa0 Why has there been no major criminal actions for people who were involved in that?\xc2\xa0 The savings and loan crisis, which was a smaller financial crisis, there were something like a thousand major criminal referrals out of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start by saying that any sort of decisions about a prosecution for a financial crime would be made by an independent federal prosecutor.\xc2\xa0 So those kids of decisions are made by prosecutors.\xc2\xa0 The reason that those decisions are not made by people who are in political jobs is because we have an expectation in this country that the law is going to be applied fairly and evenly without regard to political considerations.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in this case, those kinds of decisions are made by federal prosecutors, and I\'d refer you to the Department of Justice for an answer or an update, to the extent they can provide one, about an ongoing investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I will say is that people who have taken a close look at the financial crisis that this country endured in 2007 and 2008, many of them concluded that the problem was not predominantly that individuals were engaged in legal activity, but rather that the risky bets that they were making were entirely legal.\xc2\xa0 And that was obviously a problem.\xc2\xa0 Because when those risky bets went bad, it shook the global financial markets. It weakened confidence in the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 And it reverberated around the world.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a problem, obviously.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that is why the President, working closely with members of Congress, was committed to reforming Wall Street in a way that would not leave taxpayers on the hook for bailing out a bank or another financial institution that made bad bets.\xc2\xa0 The reform legislation also included measures that prevented, or at least reduced, the riskiness of the bets that these financial institutions were allowed to make.\xc2\xa0 For example, one of the chief reforms that were considered by the law and were implemented successfully is an increase in the capital buffer that many banks have to maintain.\xc2\xa0 Essentially, they can\'t -- they need to keep in hand more financial reserves to leverage against bets that could go bad.\xc2\xa0 And that had brought greater stability to our financial system.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the irony of this is, is that we saw many of the leading advocates of banks and traders and people on Wall Street said that those kinds of reforms would throw a wet blanket over the economy, that they would inhibit innovation and inhibit the kind of investment that\'s critical to the dynamism of our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think the kind of strength, and sustained strength, that we\'ve seen in our economy over the last several years indicates that they were wrong, that it is possible to implement the kind of Wall Street reform that would protect taxpayers, that would protect the global economy, without overly inhibiting the ability of the U.S. economy to continue to thrive.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been very satisfied that not only is it possible to strike that right balance, but that these reforms succeeded in striking that right balance in terms of protecting the American people, protecting the U.S. economy, while allowing our economy overall to thrive and to become the envy of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those are forms of protecting things going forward.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the fact that there have been no, or very few, criminal prosecutions of any major players in the meltdown is a factor in the simmering anger that a lot of Americans have that nobody was really punished for what happened?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have them in front of me, but there are certainly some statistics that we can provide related to settlements that were obtained by the Department of Justice and other actions that were taken by the Department of Treasury that indicate that there was important accountability brought to bear.\xc2\xa0 And that is important, and the President has spoken to how important that is.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat\'s important, though, and what is also critical to building confidence in the financial system is demonstrating that laws can be put in place to prevent those kinds of things from happening again.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve been very gratified over the last several years to see Wall Street reform be implemented over the strenuous objections of many on Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 In a way, that has succeeded in making our financial system safer and more stable without inhibiting the growth of a thriving U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any update on when the TPP trade agreement is going to be submitted to Congress, or has the Supreme Court nomination thrown off your schedule?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for when this would be submitted to Congress.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the text of the agreement has been public for quite some time, and it continues to be available for public review and for review by individual members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 But for an official submission to Congress, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timeframe to lay out for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt this point, it\'s not clear to me that that would in any way be affected by the ongoing effort to get members of the United States Senate to do their jobs and actually give Chief Judge Garland the kind of fair public hearing and timely yes or no vote that he surely deserves.</p>\n<p>\n\tJordan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 In trading notes with the chairwoman, will the President discuss the level of interest rates right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would not anticipate that, even in a confidential setting, that the President would have a conversation with the Chair of the Fed that would undermine her ability make these kinds of critical monetary policy decisions independently.\xc2\xa0 So the conversation hasn\xe2\x80\x99t occurred yet, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge too much.\xc2\xa0 But I know that the President cares deeply about preserving both the appearance of and the fact of the independence of the Federal Reserve and the chair.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure the President will keep that priority in mind, even in the context of their private discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to something the President said over the weekend with regard to this issue of classified information. He seemed to make a distinction when he was talking about Hillary Clinton\'s emails between classified information and really classified information, as if there were some sort of gray area between whether something deserved to be kept secret for national security reasons or not.\xc2\xa0 But this administration has been pretty absolute about going after leakers of classified information of whatever it might be, going as far as to prosecute them for divulging some of this stuff.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I guess I\'m wondering, which is it?\xc2\xa0 Does the President actually believe that there is some classified information that is more deserving of protection for national security purposes than others?\xc2\xa0 Or does he believe that in all cases you have to follow the law, and classified is classified?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s an interesting question.\xc2\xa0 Let me try to answer it in a couple of different ways here. \xc2\xa0I think what is true is that there are always going to be, always have been and will be in the future -- there will be disputes in the national security bureaucracy -- again, I use that word not perjoratively -- about what information can safely be released and what information can\'t.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo why don\xe2\x80\x99t I just give one general example that I think has been discussed in this context -- and when I say discussed in this context, I mean reported by all of you publicly -- which is the question about whether or not information continues to be classified, even though it\'s been publicly reported.\xc2\xa0 There are some in the national security establishment who would say, well, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if it\'s been reported by The Washington Post -- this information is still classified, because it could, if confirmed by the U.S. government, undermine our ability to protect sources and methods.\xc2\xa0 I think other people -- probably many other people -- would conclude that there\'s not all significant interest that the U.S. government has in keeping something secret if everybody can read about it in The Washington Post -- just to cite one example.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is part of a debate that goes on not just in the context of Secretary Clinton\'s emails, but in the context of making decisions about releasing information that\'s requested as a result of a Freedom of Information Act request.\xc2\xa0 And considering the administration responded to more than 700,000 Freedom of Information Act requests just last year, I think that should be an indication to all of us that this is a conversation that happens quite frequently.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the first thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the second thing is -- and this is something that the President did allude to in his answer -- there are secrets that are critical to our national security.\xc2\xa0 There are secrets that I think that even journalists occasionally would acknowledge should be kept secret in order to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 Now, how to keep that secret and for how long to keep that information secret is surely the subject of legitimate debate.\xc2\xa0 But at its core, there are some things that I think we all acknowledge should be kept secret, and that means when information like that is not kept secret by people who have taken an oath to protect it, that those individuals should be held accountable.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, when it comes to prosecutions by the Department of Justice of people who are accused of leaking classified information, violating the pledge that they signed to protect that information, those are decisions that are made by independent prosecutors.\xc2\xa0 And so I can\'t weigh in at this point about whether or not those prosecutions were justified or whether or not they were legitimate, or even handled appropriately.\xc2\xa0 Many of the investigations that you refer to were actually begun by the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 And I think that should be an indication to you of how serious this administration takes the responsibility of ensuring that those kinds of investigations are insulated from political influence.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact that they were commenced under a previous administration I think is an indication that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t subjected to second-guessing by people who have politics in their job description.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good thing for our country.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good thing for inspiring confidence in the ability of our investigators and prosecutors to make decisions on the merits, to make decisions in pursuit of justice and not in pursuit of a political agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that\'s why you saw the President draw such a hard line with Chris Wallace in the interview in indicating that he could guarantee that there will not be any political influence in the ongoing investigation of Secretary Clinton\'s email system. And that\'s an important part of preserving the integrity of the justice system and protecting the generally accepted notion of what justice actually is -- that this is a decision that should be made by federal prosecutors with regard to the law, not with regard to politics.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes in the principle quite strongly, and I think that\'s why he was so categorical in discussing it with Mr. Wallace.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two things.\xc2\xa0 You seem to be suggesting that the President and this administration is not supportive of some of these leak prosecutions that have happened since he\'s been President that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the point that I\'m making is, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter whether or not we support them; they\'re going to move forward because the decisions that are made about those investigations are made independent of the preference of anyone with politics in their job description.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s how it should be.\xc2\xa0 So whether or not the President or some other elected official approves of, or disapproves of, those investigations is irrelevant.\xc2\xa0 These are decisions that are made by the independent federal prosecutors, and that the way, in this country, that we ensure that our system of justice is conducted with regard to the law and to evidence and facts, not politics.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to key question of whether -- I mean, he seemed to be saying that there can be a debate over what\'s classified and what\'s not classified.\xc2\xa0 You said that earlier.\xc2\xa0 But if that\'s the case, then how can this administration expect compliance with the law?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is something classified if it\'s marked classified? Is it classified if the President or somebody else decides that it is really vital to national security?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it seems like there\'s a distinction there that\'s not being captured by the classification process that he\'s trying to get at, that it\'s not clear under the law.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President is just making the observation -- and I think you\'re drawing a pretty clear illustration here, too -- of how complicated this picture is.\xc2\xa0 And obviously there is a need for individuals who sign an oath to protect classified information to protect that information.\xc2\xa0 I signed that oath.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that I abide by.\xc2\xa0 Even in the context of these kinds of discussions that we have, it\'s not uncommon for me to be asked about classified information and I certainly do my best to try to help all of you work on your stories, but I also do so with the knowledge that I need to protect that information.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m certainly not the only official in the government that has that kind of responsibility. And it certainly is a responsibility that I take seriously, and I think it\'s a responsibility that the vast majority of government officials take quite seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think as the President alluded, Secretary Clinton has acknowledged that with regard to this information, none of which was stamped classified, that she was a little careless, and that if she had an opportunity to do it differently and to handle this information differently, she would have done that.\xc2\xa0 But what\'s also true is, she has said from the beginning that none of the information that she received or sent from that email account was stamped or marked classified.\xc2\xa0 And I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read all the emails that have been released -- many of you have -- but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any evidence publicly that what she said about that was wrong.\xc2\xa0 And considering that we\'re talking about tens of thousands of emails, I think that\'s a relevant fact.</p>\n<p>\n\tSuzanne.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can I just follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 So the President also said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that Hillary Clinton put national security at risk.\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, is this a belief, or is this knowledge based on knowing the emails or being briefed that these emails did not put national security at risk?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me be clear about this, Suzanne.\xc2\xa0 The President has neither sought nor received a confidential briefing or confidential information about the ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s knowledge about this situation is based entirely on public reporting.\xc2\xa0 This is one of the benefits of the approach that Secretary Clinton and her team have taken to dealing with this matter.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton said, let\xe2\x80\x99s just make all the email public.\xc2\xa0 And all of you and your news organizations have spent God knows how many hours reviewing all those emails, some of them interesting, most of them mundane, but it does give the American public some insight into what is included in those emails.\xc2\xa0 And when you hear the President\xe2\x80\x99s public comments on this matter, it\'s based entirely on the reporting that you and your news organizations have done on this matter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s confident that there is nothing that is missing in any -- I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely confident that he has all the information he needs to come up with that conclusion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President was asked a specific question and he shared his view based on public reporting on this that has been done.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, the President was careful, both at the beginning and at the end of the questioning, to acknowledge -- and this goes back to what Julie was asking -- to acknowledge that the opinion that really matters here is the opinion of the independent investigators who are taking a close look at this.\xc2\xa0 And the President does have confidence that those prosecutors and other investigators will exercise their independent judgment, that they\xe2\x80\x99ll set politics aside and they\xe2\x80\x99ll focus on the facts of the case and they will allow the facts to guide them as they pursue their investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that is certainly what the President would expect, and it\'s consistent with what both Attorney General Lynch and Director Comey have said about the investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just another point on what the President talked about with Fox.\xc2\xa0 He said, regarding the worst mistake, probably failing to plan the day after the U.S.-led invasion of Libya.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of people who criticize President Bush and his administration for their lack of planning after intervening in Iraq and not having sufficient understanding, historical understanding of the sectarian violence there between Sunni and Shia.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration, does the President, do they see parallels?\xc2\xa0 Do they see any kind of inherent risk in the administration leading a coalition in the Middle East in a volatile situation such as that and in terms of his own thinking of lessons learned?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\'s difficult to compare the two situations because, obviously, the previous administration ordered military action as a result of intelligence that didn\xe2\x80\x99t prove to be true.\xc2\xa0 The intervention in Libya was different.\xc2\xa0 The intervention in Libya was based on an emergent situation where you had a bloodthirsty dictator vowing to slaughter thousands, if not tens of thousands of innocent people.\xc2\xa0 And the President of the United States led an international coalition to try to prevent that from happening and, by and large, they did.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\'s difficult to compare these two situations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the post-planning, not understanding or not having the commitment of allies come through, is there any kind of parallel that the administration sees in the risk, the inherent risk of working and depending on those allies and having it fall through?\xc2\xa0 Because you talk about the power vacuum and that\'s the same thing we see here.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do think that the point that the President was making is not that any specific ally of the United States had utterly failed to follow through on a specific commitment that they had made, but rather that the United States and our broader coalition had not succeeded in mobilizing the necessary resources to bring about the scenario that we would have eventually liked to see.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the good news in Libya is that we have made some important progress in recent years.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just taken a whole lot longer than we planned for.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s the point that the President has made.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the United Nations has done some really important work in building up this government of national accord that is now in Tripoli and working to establish itself as the legitimate government of Libya, and to persuade the militias on -- the varying militias that exercise significant influence over that country to lay down their arms and to support the government of the country that can eventually try to bring the security situation inside of Libya under control.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is going to be a long process, but the United States, certainly our coalition partners at that time, and the broader international community have been critical to the success of this effort or at least of the progress that they have been able to make thus far.</p>\n<p>\n\tSerena.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 So Lt. Commander Edward Lin charged with espionage and attempted espionage -- given the fact that he was a high-ranking naval officer assigned to the maritime reconnaissance unit and the type of information he would have access to, is the President being kept updated on this case?\xc2\xa0 Is he expressing any sentiments regarding it?\xc2\xa0 And how damaging is the information he had access to in the hands of the Chinese and Taiwanese is that for American national security?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak to the substance of the allegations against the naval officer that you\xe2\x80\x99ve just described. The Department of the Navy may be able to provide you some guidance around that.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to this investigation and potential prosecution, I am quite limited in what I can say because the Department of the Navy has indicated that this individual has been charged with violations, including espionage, under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and there is a risk that saying much of anything about it could be perceived as the Commander-in-Chief influencing the chain of command with this matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s very little that I can say.\xc2\xa0 I can just confirm for you that these charges have been filed, that there is an officer that is in custody at the Naval Consolidated Brig in Chesapeake.\xc2\xa0 But other than that, I\'d just refer you to the Department of the Navy for additional steps that will be taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that the President is being updated about the case, or has he expressed any kind of interest in --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I actually do not know whether or not the President has been briefed on this particular matter.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll see if we can get you some information about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On North Carolina, the controversial law making it illegal for a transgender person to use the bathroom of their choice, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo banned nonessential travel to the state, the Boss cancelling his show there -- has the President -- would he consider not traveling to North Carolina as a result of this law, or its impact on federal employees traveling to the state?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of any decision like that having been reached on the part of the President or any other federal government official.\xc2\xa0 But obviously we\'ve seen some of the other leaders in entertainment and in business come forward and express their significant discomfort with this law that the state of North Carolina has passed and the governor has signed into law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, I talked about this a little bit before, but I think it relevant, particularly in this case, in light of even some of the more recent developments, that the state of North Carolina, over the last couple of decades, has really thrived economically by aggressively marketing a friendly business climate.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about how they\xe2\x80\x99ve really been able to harness the innovation in the Research Triangle to create an environment where small businesses with a good idea can succeed.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve seen big businesses look to try to get in on the action and to try to capitalize on that kind of environment to ensure the success of their business or to even advance their business model.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what is also true, though, is you\'re detracting from the business environment if you essentially are going to make it legal to discriminate against that business\xe2\x80\x99s employees or customers.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is a question that the governor of North Carolina, in particular, failed to account for, but one that ultimately he\'ll have to answer for.</p>\n<p>\n\tDave.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, when you said earlier that the President was taking the lesson of Libya and trying to apply it in other situations since then, we\'re you referring to Syria or ISIL?\xc2\xa0 What were you talking about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this is the kind of lesson that can be applied in a variety of situations.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s some relevant lessons to draw in thinking about the situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 For example, the President has received sustained criticism, predominantly from Republicans but not just from Republicans, for not ordering a military strike against the Assad regime back in 2013 once the intelligence community had concluded that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons against innocent civilians.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if the President had the situation in Libya in mind as he considered what should happen next, but there is a relevant analogy to be drawn in asking the question about what would happen next in Syria after that military strike was taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that\'s -- understanding the longer-term consequences of military action is important for the Commander-in-Chief to consider.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, it\'s the kind of thing that the Commander-in-Chief should consider before ordering military action.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly guides the decision-making that President Obama has made in the context of responding to ISIL both in Iraq and in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it accurate, then, to say that Libya made him more reluctant to go into Syria?\xc2\xa0 Or he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t predisposed to go into Syria in the first place, was he?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know about -- well, I guess I don\'t know entirely what you mean by predisposed to go into Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean that he started from a position of not wanting to go into Syria and getting involved in their civil war, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is certainly true that the President would have preferred to not be in a situation where he had to order a small number of U.S. special operators on the ground in Syria.\xc2\xa0 That\'s true.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, that\'s also true that he would have preferred to not be in a situation in which the United States was carrying out airstrikes or providing assistance to fighters on the ground inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 But because of the failure of the Assad regime to effectively govern that country, it created a vacuum.\xc2\xa0 And we saw an extremist organization like ISIL attempt to set up a safe haven inside of Syria, and that led to some significant problems. And the President at every turn has been focused on making sure that the kinds of decisions that he\xe2\x80\x99s making to counter ISIL are consistent with our long-term national security interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I guess the premise of your question that I would disagree with is the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done so reluctantly.\xc2\xa0 The President has understood that, at least in this case, it was important for him to order military action in order to protect the American people, in order to protect our interests around the world.\xc2\xa0 Of course, he would have welcomed a scenario in which that use of military force was not necessary.\xc2\xa0 He would certainly have preferred an Assad regime that was much more effective in respecting and protecting basic human rights and effectively governing that country.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what we have seen.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President has not hesitated to use military force where necessary to take ISIL fighters off the field, to try to have an influence over the battlefield against ISIL so that we can degrade and ultimately destroy that terrorist organization.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly one other thing, does the White House have any comment on the $5 billion settlement payment by Goldman Sachs that was finalized today in the mortgage crisis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I have a specific reaction to it.\xc2\xa0 I mean I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- this obviously goes back to Pam\xe2\x80\x99s question from earlier.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, decisions about prosecutions and settlements are made by prosecutors at the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 And so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t second-guess the conclusions that they have reached.\xc2\xa0 But I think obviously the President believes that people should be held accountable for their actions.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s particularly if there\xe2\x80\x99s a situation in which your actions may have been a contributor to the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Interesting conversation between the President and my colleague Chris Wallace on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 The President used the word \xe2\x80\x9ccareless\xe2\x80\x9d to describe Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s use of her private email server.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if he feels like there is a difference, as a constitutional lawyer, scholar, as a President, between the words careless and negligent?\xc2\xa0 Are they not the same under the law?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to parse the President\xe2\x80\x99s answer on this.\xc2\xa0 I do think the President was not careless in choosing which words to use in answering this question.\xc2\xa0 But why he chose one word over another is not something I can speak to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see them as the same?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess the point here is that in some ways it doesn\'t matter what I think.\xc2\xa0 In the most important way it doesn\'t matter what I think because this is something that is being looked at by federal prosecutors, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at how the decisions were made about setting up the email system, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll ultimately make their own conclusions.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ll make their own determination about what are the appropriate questions to ask.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, that is the way that we instill confidence in the public in our criminal justice system -- if the questions that are being asked by independent federal prosecutors are questions that they themselves decide to ask.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll decide who should answer them, and they will reach a conclusion about what consequences that means for the law and whether or not a prosecution should move forward.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a process that has served the American people quite well.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is not the tradition in many countries.\xc2\xa0 In other countries, there are situations where political officials are essentially in charge of the justice system or wield inordinate influence over the justice system such that people with different political views are treated differently in the criminal justice system.\xc2\xa0 And we value the political independence of our justice system in this country because it gives us all confidence that people are going to be considered fairly under the law without regard to their political views.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is a principle that is worth protecting.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes it does mean that I, for example, will not be able to answer your questions in as detailed a fashion as I would like because it\xe2\x80\x99s not just that this is a principle that we want to protect.\xc2\xa0 I think all of you, for example, take the Attorney General at her word when she testifies before Congress that she\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9caware of no efforts to undermine our review or investigation into this matter at all;\xe2\x80\x9d or when Director Comey says that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken a close look at the case and being regularly updated on it because he wants to make sure that \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no outside influence.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to -- the individuals who are responsible for conducting this investigation have been able to publicly conclude that they don\'t feel like they\'re subject to influence.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\'ve heard the President of the United States say definitively in the context of his interview that he would guarantee that there is no political influence that was going to be brought to bear in this kind of situation.\xc2\xa0 And I think the combination of those three comments I think can give people a lot of confidence that everybody who goes through the criminal justice system -- whether they\'re as well-known as Secretary Clinton or not -- is going to be treated fairly, and that the public interest will be served by the fair treatment of those individuals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a couple more very quickly.\xc2\xa0 If the President emailed the Secretary on her private server, or her clintonemail.com address, would he not then have an obligation to at least somehow report that?\xc2\xa0 Because you\'re talking about government business going to a private email -- presumably unsecure email server.\xc2\xa0 Would he not have to at least report that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, the point here is that while the President was certainly aware of her email address, he was not aware of the system that had been put in place to support it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are many reasons why an individual might have -- particularly somebody who is in a position like the Secretary of State who might have an email address that cannot be easily guessed by the general public or by our nation\xe2\x80\x99s adversaries.\xc2\xa0 For example, there is a reason that she was not at hclinton@state.gov\xc2\xa0 And so I think that is the reason that no one who emailed with the Secretary of State -- at least that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of -- from the White House knew of her private email server arrangement.\xc2\xa0 They certainly were aware that she had a different email address than other State Department employees.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of anybody at the White House who knew of the arrangement that she had in place.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it also, then, fair to say that no one at the White House makes it a regular occurrence -- or the President, at least, doesn\'t make it a regular occurrence to email private email addresses conducting government business?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s true.\xc2\xa0 The instructions that the White House has provided to all federal employees is that they should use their government email for government business.\xc2\xa0 And if there are isolated situations in which individuals had to use their personal email, that information is transferred over the official system so it can be properly archived and used to respond to specific inquiries.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a variety of situations where this could come up. If your Blackberry stops working, which has happened on more than one occasion, or if you\'re traveling overseas and you\'re having some trouble with connectivity, you may have access to your personal email.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s important is that this is a situation that\'s not the norm, and then in those rare instances when it is used, that those personal emails are properly maintained on the official system by either cc\xe2\x80\x99ing your official address or just forwarding the exchange over to your official account.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just so I\xe2\x80\x99m clear, so no government business should be transacted between, say, the President\xe2\x80\x99s account and some private account?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly when the President is doing business -- and he does not do very much business over email.\xc2\xa0 As you would expect, much of the business that the President is engaged in would be reasonably described as either classified or at least sensitive information.\xc2\xa0 So when the President is doing that kind of business, yes, it is generally over government email.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Eight of the 11 remaining Obamacare health insurance co-ops according to reporting are likely to fail this year.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious of knowing now what we know about the dollars spent, about the commitment made, was this the right strategy for the American people?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, the focal point of the Affordable Care Act was making sure that we are expanding access to as many people across the country as possible.\xc2\xa0 And when I say access I mean access to quality, affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that some 13 million people now have taken advantage of the Affordable Care Act to get coverage.\xc2\xa0 And this is good, quality, affordable coverage in the vast majority of cases that they didn\'t previously have access to.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd our goal here was to use competition, and we have seen positive progress in building competition in individual marketplaces.\xc2\xa0 So in individual states in 2014, the average number of issuers per state was eight.\xc2\xa0 In -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make sure I get the years right.\xc2\xa0 In 2013, it was eight; 2014 it was nine.\xc2\xa0 And this most recent year it was 10.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a steady increase in the average number of issuers per state in these individual marketplaces.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe premise here is that by increasing competition, we can create an environment in which individual insurers are competing for people\xe2\x80\x99s business.\xc2\xa0 That means that individual insurers are going to be competing to drive down costs and to drive up benefits.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s how we\xe2\x80\x99ve arrived at a scenario where more people have access to quality, affordable health insurance than ever before.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe consequence of that is that when you do see situations where particular health care arrangements don\xe2\x80\x99t pan out, the good news for the customers of those arrangements is that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got lots of other options.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve got lots of other viable options where they can go and get quality, affordable health insurance on the private market, something that was not previously available to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re okay with $2.5 billion spent, invested in 2010, and eight of the 11 remaining failing -- that\xe2\x80\x99s okay because the ends justify the means?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what we would like to see, in general, is increased competition.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\xc2\xa0 We also were looking to save money.\xc2\xa0 And over the next 10 years, we will find -- and this is something that even the CBO has concluded -- tens of billions of dollars in deficit reduction as a result of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is no denying that millions of Americans got access to quality, affordable health insurance for the first time because of the Affordable Care Act, and the American taxpayers are going to see health care costs that are paid by the federal government limited in such a way that we\xe2\x80\x99re actually going to reduce the deficit by tens of billions of dollars.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a significant achievement, one that our naysayers long thought was not possible.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s probably why many of those naysayers won\xe2\x80\x99t even acknowledge the important progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about three, four months into the year, the state of the President\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Speaker Paul Ryan?\xc2\xa0 Do they talk?\xc2\xa0 Do they talk often?\xc2\xa0 When is the last time that they spoke?\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing a good job?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President certainly does continue to respect Speaker Ryan.\xc2\xa0 I think no one underestimates the significance of the challenge that he\xe2\x80\x99s undertaken.\xc2\xa0 Certainly the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 They do speak with some frequency.\xc2\xa0 Oftentimes those are conversations that we don\xe2\x80\x99t disclose.\xc2\xa0 So I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you the last time that they spoke, but it certainly is not unusual for the two men to trade phone calls.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s typically how they\xe2\x80\x99ll communicate.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you with the impression this happens every day or every week, even.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual for them to engage in a conversation.\xc2\xa0 And the President certainly respects the important responsibilities that Speaker Ryan has as the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 And Speaker Ryan is somebody who has demonstrated that he is -- takes quite seriously the responsibilities that he has.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody who has been quite thoughtful about his views and his prescription for how to further strengthen the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, the two men have some pretty significant differences of opinion.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to focus on are areas where there is common ground.\xc2\xa0 Passing funding to make sure that our health care professionals have the necessary resources to fight Zika is something where Democrats and Republicans should be able to find common ground.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, Speaker Ryan will take action on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaker Ryan has talked before about how expanding the earned income tax credit could be a powerful way to fight poverty.\xc2\xa0 The President has considered this a reasonable and maybe even promising policy approach.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, Democrats and Republicans in the Congress could work together to arrive at an expansion of the earned income tax credit in a way that would be good for our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDemocrats and Republicans along the campaign trail have certainly spent a long time talking about how to fight heroin abuse and opioid addiction.\xc2\xa0 President Obama believes this is a priority.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall he traveled down to Atlanta a couple of weeks ago to talk about this.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, this is something -- the President was actually introduced by the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, a Republican from Kentucky named Hal Rogers.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, Mr. Rogers and Mr. Ryan can work together to advance this important priority.\xc2\xa0 The President would certainly welcome that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Ryan -- Speaker Ryan made clear that the House would begin to take action to help Puerto Rico address the significant financial challenges that are plaguing Puerto Rico.\xc2\xa0 The administration has obviously played an important role, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Democrats and Republicans come together to begin to make some progress.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work that remains to be done, but they\xe2\x80\x99re obviously off to a good start, and we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s no shortage of opportunities for Speaker Ryan and President Obama to work together in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require either of them to capitulate on core principles.\xc2\xa0 But there is an opportunity and a requirement that both of them put the interests of the country ahead of more narrow political considerations.\xc2\xa0 And I think it remains to be seen how serious House Republicans are about setting aside the grousing that they may find in some corners of their party for cooperating with President Obama so that they can actually find some common ground on something that Democrats and Republicans agree would be good for the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On politics, does President Obama have a position on the possibility that the Republicans could have a brokered convention?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He does not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, hypothetically, if Paul Ryan were to be part of that brokered convention, he would have no feeling on that either?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, my rudimentary understanding of the Republican nomination process is that as the Speaker of the House -- Speaker Ryan actually is the chair of the convention.\xc2\xa0 So if an open convention or a brokered convention does come about, it does seem that Speaker Ryan would, whether he likes it or not, play a prominent role in that prospect.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, does the White House believe its strategy to confirm Merrick Garland is working?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We certainly have made a lot of important progress in confirming -- or getting the Senate, frankly, to do its job and to give Chief Judge Garland a fair hearing and a timely yes or no vote.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a good opportunity for me to talk about what I think will be a pretty important week in this nomination process.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any meetings that Chief Judge Garland has today on Capitol Hill, but over the course of this week, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with 14 difference senators, six of them Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll be starting tomorrow by having breakfast with the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that just hours after the announcement of Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s untimely death, that Republican Leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell announced that the Senate would not be considering a presidential nomination to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 So the fact that Judge Garland is meeting this week with six different Republican senators to discuss his nomination I think is an indication that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress.\xc2\xa0 And let me explain to you why.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter meeting with these Republican senators, I think -- I guess by the end of the week, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be up to nine, because he\xe2\x80\x99s already met with three different Republican senators -- Senators Collins, Kirk and Boozman.\xc2\xa0 But after having those meetings, I think an obvious question will be begged of those Republican senators, and it\xe2\x80\x99s simply this:\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity to hear from Chief Judge Garland directly, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t your constituents?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter all, you\xe2\x80\x99re the one making the case that the people\xe2\x80\x99s voice should be heard in this process, so why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the people have the opportunity to hear from Chief Judge Garland about his views, about his record?\xc2\xa0 He obviously has spent 19 years on the federal bench, serving in the -- what\xe2\x80\x99s often described as the second-highest court in the land, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\xc2\xa0 He has more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history.\xc2\xa0 So he certainly has the capacity to answer these questions. He\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to do it on camera, under oath.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to take whatever questions Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee may have to put forward.\xc2\xa0 He can handle it.\xc2\xa0 I guess the question is, why can\xe2\x80\x99t the people asking the questions handle it?</p>\n<p>\n\tI suspect -- I have a theory, to the extent that I\xe2\x80\x99m able to divine much insight into the mind of any Republican senator -- I think this is what Republicans are concerned about.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about giving him that opportunity because, if they do, it will be clear to the American public that he\xe2\x80\x99s deserving of a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s going to make it a lot harder for them to justify blocking it.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Leader McConnell try to shut this down at the pass.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the fact that, at the end of the week, Chief Judge Garland will have met with nine Republican senators is an indication that we\xe2\x80\x99re making some important progress.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a long way to go, but it certainly is going to -- as Chief Judge Garland does these meetings, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to reduce the number of questions that Republican senators are facing about why they\xe2\x80\x99re blocking his nomination and refusing to do their job.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s only going to increase the frequency of those questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s significant because we know, for example, that this is an accusation that Chairman Grassley himself is pretty uncomfortable with.\xc2\xa0 He himself has said that he resents the notion that he\xe2\x80\x99s not doing his job.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is, as the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he has as much influence as anyone over whether or not Chief Judge Garland is going to get a fair hearing.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll have as much say as anyone about the way the Senate Judiciary Committee reports out his nomination.\xc2\xa0 And that will have a significant impact on how individual members of the United States Senate vote on his nomination.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, look, these tough questions of the senators are just getting started.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s ironic that in the back halls of Congress, you see a lot of Republican senators sort of ducking questions from members of the media about why they\xe2\x80\x99re blocking Chief Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s nomination while at the same time you see Chief Judge Garland eager to go out in public, under oath, on camera and answer all the questions that these senators can think of to ask.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is why the position that Republicans have adopted is so difficult to defend, both as a matter that\xe2\x80\x99s central to their constitutional responsibilities, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also why, frankly, as a matter of politics, it\xe2\x80\x99s a tough question for them to answer.</p>\n<p>\n\tAngela.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Back to the topic of the meeting with the Fed Chairwoman.\xc2\xa0 The L.A. Times reported last year that there\xe2\x80\x99s a Federal Reserve regulatory job, the Vice Chair for Supervision, that was created back in Dodd-Frank, but that has never been filled.\xc2\xa0 And now, Chairman Shelby is holding up other Fed nominations, saying that this is -- the fact that this job hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been filled is the reason for those holes.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any intention to ever nominate somebody to be the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s Vice Chair for Supervision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I think it is -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any personnel announcements to make at this point in terms of individuals who may be considered or when a nomination could be put forward.\xc2\xa0 But I think it is a tough case to make for Senator Shelby to say that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to fill any vacancies on the Fed until one specific vacancy has been filled.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it sort of matches people\xe2\x80\x99s common sense about how the Senate should fulfill its duties, particularly when you consider that there are two individuals, highly qualified Federal Reserve nominees, that have been put forward -- almost a year ago in one case, and more than a year ago in the other case -- to fill important positions on the board.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make a forceful case for these two individuals.\xc2\xa0 And Chairman Grassley doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly have a strong record to stand on -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Senator Shelby doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a strong record to stand on when considering nominees to the Senate Banking Committee.\xc2\xa0 It obviously is his failure to act expeditiously in this area.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that has already garnered strong criticism of his conduct.\xc2\xa0 And his continued obstruction of two highly qualified Federal Reserve nominees is only going to enhance that criticism.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other business matter.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any comment on Canadian Pacific\xe2\x80\x99s decision to abandon its merger attempt with Norfolk Southern Railroad?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I actually am not aware of those reports.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s something that just broke, but if there\xe2\x80\x99s a specific reaction we have, we can get it to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tScott, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Has the President had any conversations with Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz about her payday lending bill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the details of the legislation that she has put forward.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President has put out a statement announcing his enthusiastic support for her reelection.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any position the administration has taken on her legislative proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Her legislative proposal would sort of undermine the CFPB\xe2\x80\x99s rule that the President was touting a year ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we -- when I do a little work on learning more about her legislation, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you on it, okay?</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:47 P.M.
