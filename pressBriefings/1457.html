EST</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Fire away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Can we start with Afghanistan, and why the President felt that the options he was presented were not sufficient, why he sent them back?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start by saying I think everybody thought coming out of yesterday\'s meeting that the meeting was very productive and that we made progress.\xc2\xa0 I know you may have seen Secretary Gates say today that the President is evaluating the options, choosing what\'s best in all of them.</p>\n<p>What the President wants to ensure is that we take into account -- and understand, so that the American people can understand -- our time commitment and ensure that we have the strongest partner in the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 And we want to make sure that we continue to work on those aspects.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does he feel that he was being railroaded into a commitment by the generals?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, not at all.\xc2\xa0 I think if you ask the -- I think if you ask the generals, and again, if you see what Secretary Gates said today, the meetings were very productive.</p>\n<p>This has been a very rigorous and deliberative process with those that deal with the civilian side; with those that deal with the political side, meaning the government of Afghanistan; with the military; and with others in order to get the best decision possible.</p>\n<p>The President outlined the way we would go about making this decision, and that\'s what he\'s stuck to.\xc2\xa0 He understands that the key is getting this decision right.\xc2\xa0 And I think he believes, and I think quite frankly the participants from yesterday believe we\'ve made progress doing that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of a role did the cables from General Eikenberry have in the President\'s dissatisfaction, shall we say, with the options that were presented?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- I\'m not going to get into classified material.\xc2\xa0 But I think -- well, I know, because we\'ve talked about this before, whether you\'re Ambassador Eikenberry or General McChrystal, you have said publicly and privately in these meetings that our success in Afghanistan is most dependent upon the Afghan government being a true partner.</p>\n<p>What we have to do is establish a security environment that ultimately can be passed to the Afghans to provide that security.\xc2\xa0 That requires an Afghan national army, an Afghan national police, and a partner in delivering governance and services in order to establish -- in order to further establish a strong central government.</p>\n<p>And I think, again, you\'ve heard General McChrystal say, and you\'ve heard Ambassador Eikenberry say, and you\'ve quite frankly heard the President say that it\'s time to start a new chapter in Afghanistan when it comes to governance.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s obviously going to play a big part in the decision that he makes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 Does he share Ambassador Eikenberry\'s reported view that a sudden influx of troops would undermine the very reforms that the administration wants to see?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to leave it at -- I\'m going to leave it at that every participant in that room understands that our success in Afghanistan is dependent upon having a good and true partner in the Afghan government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, do you feel like this process is winding down?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re making progress.\xc2\xa0 I think the President gets closer and closer every day.</p>\n<p>I will say I think all the participants involved would tell you that we have examined issues that will make the President\'s decision better and give, I hope, the American people confidence when the President explains why he made his decision and what factors went into it, that they\'ll have confidence in the mission.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what\'s the next formal step in this process?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I don\'t have a meeting schedule.\xc2\xa0 I could -- I will check and see what that process is.\xc2\xa0 There wasn\'t anything on the schedule as of this morning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There will be another meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t -- I think it\'s probably likely, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any announcement before we return on Thursday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sending back these four options to kind of -- he wasn\'t happy with any of them -- doesn\'t that delay it a little bit?\xc2\xa0 You keep saying we\'re nearing the end, you know, getting closer.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, I think we -- again, I think we\'ve made tremendous progress.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re closer to getting a decision after that meeting than we were going into it, because we worked through -- the President and the team worked through a number of issues in making that final decision.</p>\n<p>So I think -- I think everybody would say that the meeting was one of progress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the United States go about ensuring a strong partner in Kabul?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we\'ve been in -- we have been talking with the government there for quite some time, including throughout the election process, about how to establish better governance.\xc2\xa0 You heard the President in the Oval Office talk about ensuring that strengthened governance and that we had to address corruption.\xc2\xa0 I think everybody understands -- everybody understands that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any sticks, or is it just carrots?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the embassy there is working on -- working on agreements with the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 And look, I think it\'s sufficient to say that whether on the civilian side of our effort, whether on the military side of our effort, or on the governance side of the Afghans, the President will want -- has asked for and will want benchmarks to evaluate our progress.\xc2\xa0 That\'s part of his desire to get a sense of where we are rather than committing to an open-ended conflict.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why wasn\'t that already integrated into the four plans that were presented to him?\xc2\xa0 Presumably that was discussed before yesterday.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Presumably that was discussed before yesterday\'s meeting.\xc2\xa0 Why it wasn\'t it in any of those plans?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Governance?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, the wanting to have benchmarks and then --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, some benchmarks have been discussed.\xc2\xa0 But what the President -- and what we\'ve talked about before is the President is -- the President believes that -- we have been there for eight years, and we\'re not going to be there forever.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s important to -- it\'s important to fully examine not just how we\'re going to get folks in but how we\'re going to get folks out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To what extent has this review taken time away from focusing at all on Iraq?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously -- I\'d say two things, most importantly.\xc2\xa0 One, I think the President would be the first to laud the work of the Vice President in ensuring that an elections law was passed by the Iraqis, because what that is ultimately going to allow us to do is keep the timetable of commitments to draw our combat forces down from Iraq.</p>\n<p>So it\'s something that doesn\'t necessarily get a lot of attention, but the passage of that law and the upcoming elections will go a long way toward winding down our combat commitment in that country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is he doing on the plane?\xc2\xa0 Is he getting briefings, working on Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s made some calls.\xc2\xa0 He has -- and he\'s just been up in the -- mostly in the cabin doing a bunch of reading.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to continue -- I mean, he\'s asked for additional refinements of these options -- is he going to get any of those back while we\'re traveling?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what the formal process is.\xc2\xa0 I assume that he will -- well, he will continue consultations and questions about this throughout the trip.</p>\n<p>And let me just give you a brief rundown of what we\'re going to do.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'ll land at Elmendorf.\xc2\xa0 There will be a -- be on the ground I think for a couple of hours.\xc2\xa0 Within those couple of hours, the President will do mainly three things.\xc2\xa0 One, he\'ll meet with the family of a soldier I believe killed in Afghanistan -- let me double-check that, I thought I had that before I came back -- meet with a family.*\xc2\xa0 Secondly will meet with a group of about 12 troops.\xc2\xa0 He does this usually when we travel to bases -- meet with them, ask them -- basically give them a chance to ask their Commander-in-Chief questions about their experiences in the military.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you (inaudible) about these 12, just chosen at random?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe they\'re random.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll double-check.\xc2\xa0 And then lastly he\'ll speak to about 2,000 troops and employees, DOD and civilian, and some of the -- some folks from the community before we depart on our second seven-hour flight to Japan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything special about the remarks we should know?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll go back and read the -- I think he\'s tinkering with them and we\'ll get a final out to you, see if there\'s anything new.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what\'s going to happen in Japan?\xc2\xa0 I was going to say tonight, but whenever it is.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t even -- we were just talking about that.\xc2\xa0 Is this tonight, or tomorrow, or how do we --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or yesterday.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- yes, I don\'t know what day -- let me get -- let me get a schedule.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he\'s going to do a meeting and a press conference when we get there.\xc2\xa0 And I anticipate that obviously with the leader of Japan will talk about -- the President will first thank them for their renewed commitment to Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 They\'ll talk about the international economy, climate change, as well as North Korea and non-proliferation.\xc2\xa0 I think those will be the main items on the docket.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have a better sense of what they talked about after the meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the bases, the base agreement?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that will come up too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be any news on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of, but I\'ll double-check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the President\'s position on the base agreement?\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates said that it\'s time to move on, and Bader has said that -- suggested that there are more talks forthcoming.\xc2\xa0 Is this an open question right now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me wait -- let me wait and get a -- I\'d rather get what they talked about on that rather than surmising.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what\'s the calculation for Mrs. Obama not to do this trip?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are two calculations.\xc2\xa0 One is Malia, and the other one is Sasha.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She\'s got a bunch of other public events while we\'re away.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 She does, but she has, first and foremost, that responsibility, and being away for so long, she\'s taking care of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of housekeeping things?\xc2\xa0 Do we have a date for this jobs summit that the President spoke about?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Early December, but I don\'t believe a final date has been picked.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And I guess a related question:\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to Copenhagen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an updates on that.\xc2\xa0 No updates on that.</p>\n<p>All right?\xc2\xa0 Let me got check on the family of the soldier.\xc2\xa0 I believe it\'s Afghanistan but I\'ll double-check on that.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us the name of the -- the name --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, the name would be helpful.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me see what the military normally does on that.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n3:38 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>*Mr. Gibbs confirmed that the soldier was killed in Afghanistan.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
