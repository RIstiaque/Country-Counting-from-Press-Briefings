EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One both for what is and has been a highly anticipated visit by the President of the United States on the campaign trail for the first time in 2016.\xc2\xa0 The President is looking forward to the event that he\'ll do today with Secretary Clinton, and he\'ll obviously be able to speak for himself about why he is so enthusiastic about her candidacy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut other than that, I\'m happy to take whatever questions may be on your mind today.\xc2\xa0 I can only imagine what they are.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we want to start with Director Comey\'s announcement.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reaction?\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us whether or not the White House got a head\'s up this was coming?\xc2\xa0 And can you tell us whether or not the President has any reservations about endorsing someone who is extremely careless with classified information?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can first confirm what Director Comey said with regard to the White House, which is that no one at the White House received advance notice of his comments.\xc2\xa0 In fact, no one at the White House received advance notice that he was planning to make comments today.\xc2\xa0 So Director Comey, in his statement I saw, confirmed that that applied to the entire federal government.\xc2\xa0 I can certainly vouch for the White House.\xc2\xa0 If you have questions about other government agencies, you can check with them.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith regard to the President\'s support for Secretary Clinton and her presidential campaign, I think you\'ll hear from him at length today about why he is so enthusiastic about her candidacy and why he believes she would be an excellent 45th President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith regard to a reaction from the White House, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an official reaction to share.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is simply that, while the FBI is completing their investigation, the career prosecutors at the Department of Justice still have to make a final determination about how and whether to proceed.\xc2\xa0 And we have gone to great lengths to avoid the appearance of interfering with this ongoing process.\xc2\xa0 Director Comey himself noted that there was no outside influence brought to bear on this investigation.\xc2\xa0 That certainly is consistent with the effort that we have made to protect the independence of the investigation.\xc2\xa0 It also is consistent with the President\'s expectations about how any sort of criminal investigation should be conducted -- that is without regard to the political standing or partisan affiliation of anybody involved in the investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo given the fact that this matter is still going to be considered by Department of Justice prosecutors, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an official reaction to what Director Comey said today about the FBI\'s investigation or the recommendation that they\'re making to those prosecutors.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree that her handling of this material was careless?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, what we\'re talking about today is an investigation that was conducted by the FBI.\xc2\xa0 This is an investigation that was conducted independent of any outside influence.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think based on what we know from Director Comey\'s comments, they\'ve looked at this in excruciating detail.\xc2\xa0 So as I alluded to last week, the President\'s views are irrelevant.\xc2\xa0 The views that matter in this case are the views of the independent FBI investigators that have spent a long time looking into the matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, with regard to the President\'s support for her candidacy, he\'ll talk at length about that today.\xc2\xa0 I think you will find him making a very forceful case about why he believes she should succeed him in the Oval Office, but I\'ll let him speak to that later today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, do you expect him to address the email issue at all during his remarks?\xc2\xa0 And do you expect him to address the overall questions about her trustworthiness that the email issue has fed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do not anticipate that the President will discuss directly the findings and recommendations announced by Director Comey today, but I do anticipate the President will deliver a forceful case about Secretary Clinton\'s qualifications and values that she\'d bring to the job as President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re curious, to the extent that you can help us, about what they\'re talking about on the flight now, and also whether President Obama has decided only to talk with her about the campaign and governance going forward -- in other words, not to kind of go over these details.\xc2\xa0 They could be on the plane right now talking about what the FBI Director has criticized her for and how he thinks that -- you know, what she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do if she\'s President.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they\'re not doing that, and maybe he\'s decided that\'s not going to be his role.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk a little bit about kind of what boundaries he\'s drawn in terms of how to advise her and what sort of advice is appropriate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I am confident that the President and Secretary Clinton are not discussing the FBI investigation that is being completed.\xc2\xa0 I\'m confident that they are not discussing the findings of the investigation that were disclosed by Director Comey today.\xc2\xa0 I\'m confident that they are not discussing the recommendation that Director Comey is making to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President believes deeply in the principle of keeping independent Department of Justice investigations separate from politics.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a principle that the President believes is not just worth upholding, but one that\'s worth fighting for.\xc2\xa0 On various occasions over the last year, year and a half in which you all have asked me questions about this, I\'ve worked hard to try to make clear how important the principle is.\xc2\xa0 And occasionally that\'s meant, as recently as today, that there are direct questions that I decline to answer.\xc2\xa0 That also means that there are conversations that the President declines to have because he believes that this is a principle that\'s worth protecting.\xc2\xa0 I have confidence that Secretary Clinton believes in that principle too.\xc2\xa0 But I\'ll allow her team to discuss that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he watch the remarks this morning, though?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Did I?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, did he --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did watch the Director\'s comments today.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not the President did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the President made aware of those comments?\xc2\xa0 And who briefed him on it?\xc2\xa0 Did the Attorney General brief him?\xc2\xa0 Did Director Comey, after he gave those remarks, brief the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 And as the Attorney General has said, no one at the White House has received a briefing on this ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 And the President has still not received a detailed briefing on this matter from anybody at the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President all along has believed that it\'s important for the Department of Justice to conduct their investigation separate from any sort of perceived influence from the White House or anybody else in the federal government.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is aware of the news.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not he watched the entirety of the Director\'s statement in real time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In his statement today, Director Comey said that the FBI went through other agencies\' email servers to find emails that Secretary Clinton had sent that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t turned over.\xc2\xa0 Did that include any White House emails or even the President\'s emails?\xc2\xa0 Were they a part of the FBI investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 Even if I did know the answer to that question, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I would be a in a position to discuss it.\xc2\xa0 But let me consult with my colleagues to see if I can get you some kind of an answer to that question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Josh, you\'ve said a lot of things that they\'re not discussing today.\xc2\xa0 What are they discussing?\xc2\xa0 Are they discussing Donald Trump?\xc2\xa0 Are they discussing potential running mates for Hillary?\xc2\xa0 And there\'s some Cabinet members who are on her short list, apparently.\xc2\xa0 He you could give some references, I assume.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, they\'re having a conversation right now.\xc2\xa0 And since I\'m talking to all of you, it\'s hard for me to provide a detailed readout of that.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just say in general that -- look, I\'ve made clear what they\'re not discussing, but I would not be surprised if they do have an opportunity to discuss the ongoing campaign.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Secretary Clinton has lots of people who have good intentions, who can offer solid political advice. \xc2\xa0The President is among them.\xc2\xa0 And presumably someone who has won two national elections with more than 50 percent of the vote -- the first time that any President has done that since President Dwight D. Eisenhower -- I\'m confident that Secretary Clinton is interested in whatever advice the President might have to share.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut President Obama has also been in the position of receiving a large quantity of political advice in the context of a competitive national election.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m confident that he will be respectful of the important decisions that she has to make.\xc2\xa0 She alone is the person who can make the right decision for her and her campaign.\xc2\xa0 And the President, I\'m confident, will be entirely respectful of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where are they having that meeting now, Josh?\xc2\xa0 And can you also address some criticism today about the fact that they\'re flying together on Air Force One?\xc2\xa0 Are the taxpayers paying for that?\xc2\xa0 How is that funded or billed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Shortly before I walked back here to visit with all of you, they were visiting with some staff in the senior staff cabin.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to this trip, the White House of course follows all the rules and regulations that apply to the President\'s political travel.\xc2\xa0 Those rules and regulations apply when the President makes what are now routine fundraising trips to places like Seattle and New York, most recently.\xc2\xa0 Those rules also apply when the presumptive Democratic nominee for President is onboard Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ll follow all those rules and regulations.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, the Democratic National Committee files monthly reports with the FEC.\xc2\xa0 And in those reports, the Democratic National Committee discloses the disbursements that they make to the federal government consistent with those rules and regulations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the White House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t disclose the reimbursement rate for specific flights, so it\'s impossible to determine what the specific reimbursement rate is for a trip like this one.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the White House would commit to disclosing in the future as the most transparent administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The White House follows all the rules and regulations that are on the books.\xc2\xa0 And we can get you the very specific part of the code that applies in this situation.\xc2\xa0 We follow all those rules, and the DNC does disclose on a monthly basis the payments that they make to the federal government consistent with those rules and regulations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s been a week -- really a month of Americans seeing large-scale terrorist attacks taking place across the globe, including here at home.\xc2\xa0 Given the attack in Iraq, the attack in Bangladesh, what\'s sort of the response or your message to the American people after a week of seeing the same stuff play over the news to reassure them that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to come here at home?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, President Obama believes that his most important responsibility as President is the safety and security of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the President goes to great lengths to make clear that that\'s a priority.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the United States is leading a coalition of 66 nations to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 This international coalition was possible because the President demonstrated some leadership in the international community and worked hard to assemble this diverse coalition to focus our efforts against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And that includes military efforts involving 13,000 airstrikes that have resulted in more than 45 percent of the territory in Iraq that ISIL previously controlled being retaken.\xc2\xa0 Syria opposition forces with the support of our coalition have retaken about 20 percent of the territory inside of Syria that ISIL previously controlled.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re making progress, and we are applying significant pressure to ISIL leaders in Iraq and in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, what we have seen is an effort by ISIL to try to export their radical ideology and inspire people to carry out acts of violence in other locations.\xc2\xa0 The United States is working very intensively with our allies and partners around the globe to combat those efforts.\xc2\xa0 That includes trying to counter the radical messaging of ISIL on social media.\xc2\xa0 It includes better coordination among intelligence agencies and customs officials to shut down the flow of foreign fighters and to more effectively monitor individuals who are crossing borders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this is a significant challenge.\xc2\xa0 And the President and his national security team understand that this isn\'t just a significant challenge, it\'s also the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority.\xc2\xa0 And the President receives regular briefings on homeland security, and the President receives regular briefings from his national security team about our ongoing efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m confident that for as long as he remains in office, the President and his team will be focused very carefully on this priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, there was some indecision about whether the Secretary and the President were going to make this trip together, especially after the Bill Clinton-Loretta Lynch encounter last week.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about how the decision was made to travel together and what the symbolism of sort of continuity of purpose that\xe2\x80\x99s intended to send?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, obviously by traveling together it gives President Obama and Secretary Clinton the opportunity to spend some time together and to visit.\xc2\xa0 I know President Obama is looking forward to doing so as he was boarding the plane.\xc2\xa0 I would expect that people might conclude that the President has a lot of personal affection for Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 People might conclude that the President is deeply invested in the success of her campaign.\xc2\xa0 It would be right to draw those conclusions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, with regard to the ongoing work at the Department of Justice, we have made clear time and time again that neither President Obama nor the White House is involved in that investigation.\xc2\xa0 Neither President Obama nor the Obama White House will be involved in the prosecutorial decisions that are made by career prosecutors who have received now the recommendation of the FBI.\xc2\xa0 So what message Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s travel aboard Air Force One sends and what it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t send should be quite clear to the American public.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just to draw a line under the earlier discussion, the DNC will reimburse the White House or the taxpayers for the appropriate level of money for this flight?\xc2\xa0 Is that how it works?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s slightly more complicated than that.\xc2\xa0 But in a general --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you spell it out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was hoping to avoid to in this setting, but let me just give you the top lines and we\'ll walk through the details.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe can get you the specific rules that are written down that apply in this scenario.\xc2\xa0 But my understanding about the way that this works is that the Democratic National Committee essentially establishes an escrow account that Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign committee pays into.\xc2\xa0 And then the DNC will make disbursements from that escrow account to pay for the costs associated with President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s political activities.\xc2\xa0 Because, keep in mind there are payments that are made by the DNC to the federal government any time the President is traveling for political purposes.\xc2\xa0 So the fact that Secretary Clinton is aboard Air Force One doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the rules.\xc2\xa0 Those rules apply both for routine fundraising trips, but also when Secretary Clinton is aboard Air Force One.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that, in general, is how this process works.\xc2\xa0 But it is extraordinarily complicated.\xc2\xa0 And we can certainly get you some more information, particularly as it relates to the details of the law in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When somebody says "taxpayers are paying for this trip and I object to that," your response to that is?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That the Obama administration follows all the rules and regulations about paying for political travel that previous administrations, both Democratic and Republican, have followed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this is purely a political trip?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no official business on this trip, correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is correct.\xc2\xa0 This is a political trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, how many more of these events should we expect the President to be doing jointly with Secretary Clinton?\xc2\xa0 Is this going to be -- is this sort of the kickoff of a long summer of these joint events and appearances together?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I\'ll let Secretary Clinton and her team describe the strategy here.\xc2\xa0 I think one observation that I can make is that one of the benefits of having the strong political support of someone as high-profile and as influential as President Obama is that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t struggle to get attention for the affirmative case that he will make for Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 There may be other prominent supporters of Secretary Clinton that only get a lot of attention for their remarks if they are appearing onstage with Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 President Obama can do so on his own.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that is only part of the kind of benefit associated with his strong support for Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\'t rule out future joint events, but one of the reasons that President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s support is so important is it will not require the President making joint appearances with Secretary Clinton for you all to notice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we ask one more question about the VP search, which I think was touched on earlier?\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that President Obama would share his views or help bounce ideas around if Secretary Clinton asked, in terms of a running mate?\xc2\xa0 Or do you know whether that\'s already occurred?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I don\'t know whether or not that\'s occurred.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t anticipate being able to provide a detailed readout of their conversation, so I don\'t know whether or not she will ask him about that.\xc2\xa0 If Secretary Clinton wanted to talk to President Obama about choosing a running mate, I\'m sure he would not hesitate to engage in that discussion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama has often described choosing Vice President Biden to be his running mate as the smartest political decision he ever made.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\'s fair to say that President Obama believes that he was extraordinarily well served by the successful execution of the process of choosing a running mate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI know that Secretary Clinton has spoken admiringly of how well Vice President Biden has served President Obama.\xc2\xa0 So presumably, Secretary Clinton would agree with President Obama that he made a smart decision in choosing Vice President Biden to be his running mate.\xc2\xa0 That might lead her to seek President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s advice in that process.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t know whether or not it\'s happening.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think even if I knew that it were, I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s something I would be in a position to confirm, just because they\xe2\x80\x99re having a private conversation about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More broadly on messaging, staying on message is important to the administration.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering whether President Obama is a little frustrated that on this day -- which took months of waiting until she had the right delegate numbers and the timing was right -- whether on this day, when he wanted the message to be just a pure show of Democratic unity, having images of them stepping off the plane together with headlines that read \xe2\x80\x9cFBI\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccareless\xe2\x80\x9d is really not what he wanted, and whether he is concerned that even if the long-term effect of today is that there\xe2\x80\x99s no prosecution, that the short-term effect will be to step on the message of the two of them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Listen, I don\'t think the President is particularly concerned about that, primarily because the question you\'re raising is entirely outside of his control.\xc2\xa0 Neither the President nor anybody at the White House had any influence on the ongoing -- or the recently completed FBI investigation.\xc2\xa0 There was no White House influence on the conduct of that investigation.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no White House influence on the conclusion of that investigation.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no White House influence on the decision that Director Comey made to publicize many of the results of that investigation.\xc2\xa0 And there certainly is no White House influence on the recommendation that Director Comey made to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think this falls in the category of accepting the things that you can\'t control.\xc2\xa0 But I think what is also true is that the decision of the most popular national politician in the country to endorse the Democratic nominee is something that people will notice.\xc2\xa0 And the President will have a very forceful case to make.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll let all of you judge for yourself how effective he is in making that case.\xc2\xa0 But the President has a forceful case to make, and I am completely confident that the news of the President making that case alongside Secretary Clinton will cut through.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more thing.\xc2\xa0 Director Comey has come under fire from a number of Republicans, it seems, particularly including the Speaker of the House, questioning the decision not to recommend criminal charges to the DOJ.\xc2\xa0 Would the President defend Director Comey from that criticism?\xc2\xa0 Would you defend Director Comey from that criticism?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just make a couple of observations.\xc2\xa0 The first is that Director Comey is of sufficient stature and skill that he can defend himself.\xc2\xa0 The second is that there were a number of Republican members of Congress who, prior to today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, expressed confidence in the investigation because Director Comey was leading it.\xc2\xa0 I think the third relevant point is not just that Director Comey served in a prominent role in a Republican administration, but rather that Director Comey is somebody with a well-established reputation of being able to put politics aside and focus on his official responsibilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s the reason the President chose him for the job.\xc2\xa0 Presumably, that\'s also the reason that Director Comey was confirmed with such strong bipartisan support in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, Director Comey is of sufficient skill and stature that he can defend himself.\xc2\xa0 He certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need my help.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END 2:20 P.M.
