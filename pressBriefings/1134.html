EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As you know, the President, later this afternoon at 2:30 p.m., is meeting with the House Democratic Caucus here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 He looks forward to that meeting, as he did to the meetings that preceded it with the Senate Democrats, the Senate Republicans, and yesterday with the House Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He will listen to House members, House Democrats, in the meeting today, to their thoughts about some of the pressing issues involving the economy, especially the negotiations we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in right now to significantly reduce our deficits and long-term debt.\xc2\xa0 And he will obviously take questions and provide answers to whatever is on the House Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 minds.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So we may have a readout for you in more detail after that meeting happens.\xc2\xa0 And with that I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two topics, please.\xc2\xa0 On that front, one of the points that came out yesterday was Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that in order to keep the process moving or maybe even speed it up that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to more personally engage with the President.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the White House\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint is on when that would be appropriate for the President in terms of the talks that are being led by Vice President Biden, at some point presumably that the President would sort of step in.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the thinking behind when to do that, how to do that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are engaged in a process, Ben, that has been productive, has made progress, in these negotiations led by the Vice President at the President\xe2\x80\x99s request, involving members from both houses and both parties appointed by the leaders, including Eric Cantor for the House Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mr. Cantor and others have said that there has been solid progress made in these discussions.\xc2\xa0 We consider those the vehicle right now for reaching an agreement, which we are optimistic that we can reach.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Obviously the President is very engaged in this process.\xc2\xa0 He is updated constantly and meeting regularly with his team that is participating in those negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for when he might meet with the Speaker of the House or others, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timetable for you on that.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to those negotiations producing -- continuing to make progress and producing a bipartisan agreement that recognizes that there is common ground that can be found here to reach a goal that we all share, which is we need to reduce our deficit, not as an esoteric goal but in order to prove that we can live within our means and, by that, show -- create confidence in our economy and grow the economy and create jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This debate, these negotiations, again, are not just about numbers, they\xe2\x80\x99re not about reducing deficits or debts as a goal unto themselves.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re about economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 And the President thinks they\xe2\x80\x99re very important; he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to them.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he has shown in his budget proposals, shown in the Affordable Care Act, that he is committed to deficit reduction, and shown by appointing the Vice President to lead these talks that his commitment remains very strong.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So until those talks come to their natural fruition, it\xe2\x80\x99s premature to have kind of direct presidential-Speaker engagement?\xc2\xa0 Is that fair?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President may or may not speak with the Speaker during the time that those negotiations are going on.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement to make about any meetings or phone calls that might take place.\xc2\xa0 They have a relationship and they\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously worked together closely on the continuing resolution for fiscal year 2011 and other issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the vehicle for these negotiations is the talks led by the Vice President, and we feel that those talks have been productive, that the folks around the table in those negotiations have come to the table to do serious work, and we are optimistic that we can find common ground and produce a deficit-reduction package that Americans will support.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other quick question, please.\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of this issue, I presume, about Google\xe2\x80\x99s concerns that China has tapped email accounts, including some of U.S. officials?\xc2\xa0 And does he think that China is in any way behind this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is obviously aware of it.\xc2\xa0 He is updated on these sorts of things regularly.\xc2\xa0 Threats to information and communications infrastructure pose a serious economic and national security challenge for the United States and our partners, which is why the President has made cyber security one of his top priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As with all intrusions, we employ an all-of-government approach with the appropriate agency in the lead.\xc2\xa0 In this case, the FBI is coordinating a response.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously aware of these reports.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re looking into these reports.\xc2\xa0 We have no reason to believe at this point that any official U.S. government email accounts were accessed.\xc2\xa0 But for more details about their origin or the investigation, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the FBI.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Alister.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two topics, but I\xe2\x80\x99d like to stay with Google to start with.\xc2\xa0 What is the U.S. government\xe2\x80\x99s policy towards personnel having private Gmail accounts?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the U.S. government policy -- certainly, the administration policy that is effective here is that we -- all of our work is conducted on work email accounts; that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the Presidential Records Act.\xc2\xa0 So the issue in terms of, as I mentioned, our work accounts, we have no evidence to suggest that any of those accounts were accessed or compromised.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it the policy that you\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed to have a Gmail account for private use --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- or another nongovernmental --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the policy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no policy in place that would say certain members of the government, senior officials, are not allowed to use Gmail accounts at all for private use?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about private use that\xe2\x80\x99s just different from work use.\xc2\xa0 We are definitely instructed that we need to conduct all of our work on our government accounts as part of the Presidential Records Act.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any law or rule that suggests that government workers cannot have separate private email accounts.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And no one has -- okay, so I understand that.\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Separate question -- on Yemen, could you tell us what message John Brennan is taking to the region from the President?\xc2\xa0 He visited Saudi Arabia, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s traveling to the UAE.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, this trip is driven by our concern about the events in Yemen, as part of our close consultations with the Gulf Cooperation Council.\xc2\xa0 John Brennan, who is Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, traveled to Saudi Arabia and is now in the UAE for meetings with government officials to discuss the deteriorating situation there in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 We continue to call on President Saleh to sign the accord that he said he would sign, and to transfer -- to begin the process of transferring power immediately.\xc2\xa0 We continue to call on his government to cease and desist from using violence against peaceful protestors.\xc2\xa0 And we remain very concerned about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No special message from the President for the Saudi Arabians or the UAE --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, beyond -- I mean, the message that I just delivered from here is the message that John Brennan is carrying, and he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously working with our allies in the region to see what can be done to persuade President Saleh to follow the agreement he made to sign the accord and to begin the transfer of power immediately.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In New Hampshire, just a few minutes ago, the former governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney, announcing his presidential campaign said, \xe2\x80\x9cBarack Obama has failed America.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Romney said that there was a recession already in place when President Obama took office, but he made the recession last longer.\xc2\xa0 Your thoughts?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there will be a time and a place for the President to engage in 2012 election politics, and my guess is that will be 2012.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that when this President took office, we were in the deepest recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 The President inherited the largest deficit in the history of the country from an administration that had, when it came into power eight years previous, inherited budget surpluses from a Democratic President.\xc2\xa0 The recession got worse before it got better when this President took office.\xc2\xa0 We were hemorrhaging jobs at a rate of 600,000 to 700,000 a month.\xc2\xa0 The circumstances were unprecedented, save the Great Depression, as you well know -- all of you covered it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There were moments in the first few months when this President took office, long before anything he could do -- any action he could take could take force, where people were talking about unemployment rates of 25 or 30 percent; bank holidays or nationalization of the banks.\xc2\xa0 The situation was severe; the crisis was profound.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President took dramatic action, including unpopular decisions like bailing out the auto industry, the American auto industry, because he felt it was the right thing to do; he felt that the million jobs associated with the auto industry were worth saving if we could extract from those companies measures that would ensure that they were given the better chance of succeeding.\xc2\xa0 As Ron Bloom said yesterday from this podium, there is ample evidence to suggest that that decision was the right one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have now experienced 14 straight months of private sector job creation -- 2.1 million jobs created.\xc2\xa0 Again, he\xe2\x80\x99s taking office with an inheritance of a great recession and 600,000 to 700,000 jobs lost per month; in the last 14 months, 2.1 million created -- seven quarters of economic growth.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having said that, we are a long way from home, as the President makes clear every time he talks about the economy.\xc2\xa0 There is work to be done.\xc2\xa0 Unemployment remains unacceptably high.\xc2\xa0 That is why he took measures like he did just in the last six months, extending the middle-class tax cut, ensuring in the negotiations on that tax cut with the Republicans that we get a payroll tax cut holiday for working Americans so that if you\xe2\x80\x99re making $50,000 a year right now, you\xe2\x80\x99re getting a thousand dollars extra because of that tax cut the President insisted on; the American Opportunity Tax Credit, to ensure that American children can go to college, help them go to college; the Child Care Tax Credit extension to help families with children when parents are working.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Going forward, he is, as you know, pushing free trade agreements that will -- three of them -- which will produce 70,000 jobs, create or support 70,000 jobs in America; pushing for an R&amp;D tax credit for things like clean energy investment, to make that permanent so that we can invest in industries that will create jobs and remain in America and will drive competition in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 There is no issue that matters more to this President than the economic health of this country and the job security and job creation in this country, job security of Americans and job creation in this country.\xc2\xa0 So he is focused on this very directly.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the meeting yesterday with House Republicans, a number of the House Republicans said to the President that they wanted him to introduce a budget that was score-able, that CBO could actually assess, instead of what he introduced, broad outlines of the April speech at GW.\xc2\xa0 And the President seemed to indicate he was not going to do that.\xc2\xa0 I think you even said from the podium that he wanted something score-able that was part of a compromise, not his own separate budget proposal.\xc2\xa0 Why not, if the Republicans in the House are saying it would help the negotiating process to have a score-able --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We heard two things from the Republicans yesterday, one from the Speaker, that we need to get these negotiations wrapped up and finished in the next few weeks and that the President should put forward a new plan, a new proposal that should make its way through Congress and be scored.\xc2\xa0 I think those are compatible.\xc2\xa0 Everyone knows what the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is, what his plan is, the parameters of his plan.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s quite clear.\xc2\xa0 The Democrats are aware of it; Republicans are aware of it; the President has spoken about it at length -- and that is what the Vice President brought to the table for these negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re at a point now where we don\xe2\x80\x99t need new plans; we need to find common ground around the shared goal of significant deficit reduction and come together, hold hands, and agree that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get this done, and find as much common ground as we can in what the President believes needs to be a balanced approach towards deficit reduction, because as I said earlier, it is not a goal unto itself, and it should not be done in a way that harms economic growth, which is a serious concern.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is so committed to maintaining investments in education and infrastructure and in innovation -- areas like clean energy that are the drivers -- will be the drivers and are the drivers of economic growth going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Dan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question, why does the President not get involved or lead those talks directly?\xc2\xa0 Since the stakes are so high, would it not be better if he got involved sooner rather than later?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Dan, I feel like there is a certain element here of Groundhog Day.\xc2\xa0 I remember getting the same questions about the President\xe2\x80\x99s engagement in the continuing resolution.\xc2\xa0 And as you know -- the discussions that led to an agreement for the funding of fiscal year 2011.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This President is intently focused and directly engaged in this process.\xc2\xa0 He has designated his Vice President to lead talks on a regular basis, as he has been doing in this process.\xc2\xa0 And obviously he will engage in different ways and other ways going forward.\xc2\xa0 But the vehicle for these negotiations is the talks that the Vice President is leading.\xc2\xa0 And we, like other participants in those negotiations, believe that they have been productive.\xc2\xa0 And so we are encouraged by the progress they have made.\xc2\xa0 We believe that there is reason to be optimistic that an agreement can be reached.\xc2\xa0 And so we want to continue with that process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us some of the specifics as to what the progress is?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you keep talking -- I know yesterday we tried to get you to answer that, but what are some of those specifics about the progress?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics precisely because the talks have been productive and they have made progress.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons is that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us in a broad sense --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, in a broad sense, obviously they are looking at the variety of ways that you can reduce the deficit, which includes attacking the four drivers of our long-term deficits and debt:\xc2\xa0 non-defense discretionary spending, defense spending, entitlement spending, and tax revenues, so the -- or tax spending, spending in our tax code.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So all of that is on the table.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Republican proposal.\xc2\xa0 The President put forward his proposal.\xc2\xa0 There are other ideas that are obviously part of the discussion.\xc2\xa0 And what they are searching for is common ground around those areas that they can agree on to significantly reduce our deficit going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Chip.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, whose deadline is it to get this done by the end of the month?\xc2\xa0 Because Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s office says it\xe2\x80\x99s not his deadline, that the reports that he set a deadline are wrong, but what he was talking about in the meeting was that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was just responding to those reports that he had said --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They say that\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xc2\xa0 They say that he was responding to the President saying he wants to get it done by the end of this month, because if they don\xe2\x80\x99t it will rattle the markets.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re referring, again, to two separate issues here, which is the raising of the debt ceiling on the one hand, which does need to get done sooner rather than later, because there is risk if you push it to the limit, which would, based on what we know now, be the end of July, that you could rattle the markets and have -- experience some of the negative impacts of not raising the debt ceiling, even before the deadline.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s, I think, the issue the President was referring to.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Now, we have not linked the two directly.\xc2\xa0 Others have.\xc2\xa0 We believe we can make progress on both.\xc2\xa0 We believe both are high priorities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of those two very high priorities, one is absolutely necessary, has to be done by a date certain, and that is raising the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 The alternative to doing that would be catastrophic, as many observers have explained.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So that is what the President is referring to in general.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of this particular conversation or exchange.\xc2\xa0 I read the report that the Speaker had talked about getting this done within the month.\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s referring to raising the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office claims that the President said both pieces of this could get done by the end of the month.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into hearsay about who said what when.\xc2\xa0 We think both are on track to get done within the same period of time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President has not set a deadline for both pieces by the end of the month?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Along with that, the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office is saying that the Biden talks have only made marginal progress and that it\xe2\x80\x99s too slow to get it done in time, and that something else is --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is hard work and that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and even Biden only said they have a trillion at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The -- a trillion dollars is a lot of money, Chip, first of all.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money, but it\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere near -- and the hard part is still to go.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact is that most reports about the talks reflect what we believe, which is that they have been productive and have made progress.\xc2\xa0 Hard work tends not to happen quickly, but the process is moving forward and they have been productive.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said a few weeks ago that you rarely -- or actually the quote was, you were asked about the President talking about the nominating process, and you said, \xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, it\xe2\x80\x99s just not coming up, especially on the Republican side very much.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure at some point, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not now.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Are you hearing more of that chatter from the President now --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When we\xe2\x80\x99re traveling, when we\xe2\x80\x99re -- I spend a lot of time talking with him about different subjects.\xc2\xa0 He is not focused on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he talking by phone with the group that\xe2\x80\x99s having this big fundraising meeting in Chicago today?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And why is Bill Daley at that meeting?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his role?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill Daley is here today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, he is?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 They had reports that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He was here this morning.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in the back-and-forth between the state of Indiana and Medicaid about Planned Parenthood funding, what happens if Indiana refuses to change its law?\xc2\xa0 Can you guys withhold Medicaid funding to get them to comply?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- first of all, the decision was made by the Center for Medical -- Medicare and Medicaid Services after examining the law.\xc2\xa0 Federal law prohibits federal Medicaid dollars from being spent on abortion services; that\xe2\x80\x99s very important to know.\xc2\xa0 Medicaid does not allow states to stop beneficiaries from getting care they need -- care like cancer screenings, preventative care, mammograms -- just because their provider offers certain other services.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the law.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a long history of states complying with CMS.\xc2\xa0 Between January 2010 and May 31, 2011, CMS formally denied 19 state planned amendments, similar to the one Indiana has requested.\xc2\xa0 CMS did not impose penalties in any of these matters because the states worked to come into compliance, and we fully expect Indiana to come into compliance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t expect an extended back-and-forth between --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We will work with Indiana or the agency involved here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll work with Indiana and we expect them to come into compliance.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Another health care-y question.\xc2\xa0 The health care law signed by the President plans a significant expansion of ACOs -- Accountable Care Organizations.\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s Washington Post said that the initial pilot was not successful.\xc2\xa0 Your reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are the ones that the health care law is expanding totally different than this pilot one?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, actually -- I confess I didn\xe2\x80\x99t read that story so I can\xe2\x80\x99t comment specifically on it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously committed to implementing the Affordable Care Act, and believe that it will bring significant benefits as it already has to millions of Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And very quickly on the Commerce Secretary nominee.\xc2\xa0 Some Republicans have made some noise about resisting his nomination, or being opposed to his nomination -- Senator Inhofe, on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, promising that he will fight his nomination vigorously.\xc2\xa0 Any concern from your perspective?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard why he will fight it vigorously, on what grounds.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is an enormously qualified nominee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Natural Resources.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Which he co-founded several decades ago, many decades ago, in fact, and has since -- which is an honorable and notable part of his resume.\xc2\xa0 He has also been a CEO in a major, major company -- one of the largest energy companies in the country.\xc2\xa0 And he has served on the board of companies like Boeing and others.\xc2\xa0 So -- and Disney.\xc2\xa0 So he is an enormously qualified nominee.\xc2\xa0 He brings a wealth of experience in the private sector, the public sector.\xc2\xa0 He has worked hard in the clean energy sector since he retired from Edison.\xc2\xa0 The President is very confident that Mr. Bryson\xe2\x80\x99s credentials are very strong and will be recognized as such by the Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you expect a battle or a controversy or --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there\xe2\x80\x99s controversy here.\xc2\xa0 Every nominee is sent up for inspection by the Senate, and we fully expect and believe that the Senate will confirm Mr. Bryson.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does -- hi.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that the financial status of Medicare is urgent enough to require reform to be completed, decided upon before Election Day next year?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, as you know, has already instituted significant reforms in Medicare --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But more in the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- significant savings from the Affordable Care Act, which I would note are part of the Republican plan -- not the protections that the Affordable Care Act provides, not the expansion of health care that the Affordable Care Act provide, but the savings that are part of that Affordable Care Act is part of the Republican plan.\xc2\xa0 And that plan is being implemented as I just said.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President, further in his budget proposals of this year, has demonstrated that further savings can be found in entitlement spending, including in Medicare.\xc2\xa0 What he believes is essential is that the benefit and the guarantee provided by Medicare be maintained.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, he believes that we need to reform entitlements to make them stronger --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before the election?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he would hope to.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he announced at George Washington University his vision for doing just that.\xc2\xa0 And he would -- if that plan were presented to him to sign into law he would sign it.\xc2\xa0 So he would love to do it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to dominate the time here, but I have two other important questions.\xc2\xa0 The House now -- House Republicans now plan to bring a Libya resolution to the floor tomorrow, disapproving of the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy in calling for a withdrawal.\xc2\xa0 What is your -- what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s disposition towards that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, from our vantage point, there is pretty unified support in Congress for a policy that calls for the Qaddafi regime to remove itself from power.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen in the actions that this administration has taken enormous amount of progress towards that end with our unilateral and multilateral non-lethal actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to tighten the noose around Qaddafi, make it clear to him that his days are numbered, that he will no longer rule Libya, and that he needs to remove himself from power.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He has also done exactly what he said he would do when he initiated action -- kinetic action, if you will, military action -- against Libya as part of a NATO coalition.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the time he said we would take the lead in this NATO action, and our lead role would be limited to days, not weeks.\xc2\xa0 There was skepticism about that.\xc2\xa0 He delivered on that promise and did exactly what he said.\xc2\xa0 NATO has been in the lead for a long time now.\xc2\xa0 That mission has been enormously successful.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It has done what U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 insisted that it do, which is provide for security and protection of civilians against attack by the Qaddafi regime.\xc2\xa0 It has given -- it has saved the people of Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 It has saved -- made considerable strides in protecting Misurata and other areas of the country.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen the opposition make progress in its efforts against the Qaddafi regime.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have also seen notably numerous defections from the regime, another indication that the policies of this administration and our partners and allies are working.\xc2\xa0 Just yesterday, the oil minister defected from the regime.\xc2\xa0 This is highly significant.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So we believe that the policy is working.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the goal the President has is shared by a vast majority of members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And we have consulted with Congress every step of the way since we have initiated this policy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, I want to squeeze in one more question, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t follow up on that one.\xc2\xa0 But this E. coli, the outbreak in Germany, what is the level of concern here?\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he has been briefed.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously always concerned about our own food supply, which is why we do so much to ensure that food that is imported into this country is safe.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, in terms of the specifics of the programs that we have to ensure that, I refer you to the Department of Agriculture.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why does it rise to the level of a presidential briefing?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, he gets all sorts of -- it could be a single sentence -- updates on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening around the globe.\xc2\xa0 So he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a specific brief on this -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to imply that.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s made aware of events like this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Libya, notwithstanding everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve said about the mission and the United States doing what the President said it would do, does -- given the bipartisan concern about this mission, particularly in the House, does the President -- do you feel the President needs to do more to explain, justify, bring people along in support of this mission?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have been in numerous consultations with Congress and we will continue that.\xc2\xa0 We think that\xe2\x80\x99s an obligation that the President has in situations like these.\xc2\xa0 Our involvement militarily is limited, as the President promised, and will continue to be so.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s made very clear, for example, that we will not be sending ground troops to Libya -- that is off the table.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the mission is having success.\xc2\xa0 We are pleased with the fact that NATO announced I think yesterday or the day before that it is extending the military mission another 90 days.\xc2\xa0 We think that\xe2\x80\x99s important and we think that, as participants in that mission, we think that that was called for and that it will continue the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made thus far.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Beyond that, beyond the consultations with Congress, I think the President feels very strongly that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing the right thing here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So given that case that you just made and given that you have been consulting with Congress, what do you think accounts for the fairly widespread concerns about this mission?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, I leave that up to the folks who are reporting on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a diversity of opinion on Capitol Hill about different aspects of any mission like this.\xc2\xa0 But, again, we have been consulting with Congress.\xc2\xa0 We have followed through on everything the President said he would do in terms of the way he would implement the policy that he set forward when he announced it.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to Muammar Qaddafi being -- removing himself from power, stepping down from power, and to the Libyan people having an opportunity to chart their own future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you think that anything else is needed in terms of communication, or is what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing pretty well --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The communication is regular and constant.\xc2\xa0 So in that sense, of course it is.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue that consultation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, have there been contingency talks or plans drawn up should August 2nd come around and the debt limit not be raised?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You would have to ask the Department of Treasury.\xc2\xa0 I think that Secretary Geithner and others have made abundantly clear that there is not an alternative here.\xc2\xa0 And that is a view that is held by countless economists, countless leaders in business, and countless politicians, including President Ronald Reagan in a letter he wrote to Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker back in 1983, echoes the sentiments exactly in almost precise language what the President has stated and Secretary Geithner has stated about the impermissibility of defaulting on our obligations as the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 That just simply cannot happen.\xc2\xa0 The consequences would be too grave.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we believe that leaders in Congress of both parties understand that.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that Congress will act to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to that happening.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we also share the concern that members of Congress have that we need to get our deficits under control, that we need to live within our means, which is why we are pursuing so aggressively these negotiations to come up with a bipartisan deal to do just that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the debt issue be part of his speech tomorrow at Chrysler?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that will be the case.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to rule it out either.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to focus tomorrow obviously on the remarkable progress that the auto industry has made, the impact that has not just directly on employees of the auto companies but on communities and other businesses, and what it says more broadly about what we believe is a rebound in manufacturing in this country that is very important as we head into the meat of the 21st century, if you will, because the need to make things here in America that are the best-made products, the most competitive products, is vital to our economic health in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, to follow up on that, while manufacturing in autos is on the rise, as you say, the manufacturing overall in the U.S. is the slowest now since September of 2009.\xc2\xa0 Consumer confidence is the lowest in six months.\xc2\xa0 And the S&amp;P has dropped 4 percent just in the past month.\xc2\xa0 Now, what -- how is he going to address those --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would say to the -- what I would say is -- I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, and this builds on an earlier question, and that is we are aware of these different economic reports.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we watch them closely.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also aware, and I would point out, that the trends here, the longer-term trends, are quite positive.\xc2\xa0 And we have said from the beginning that the road out of the dark place we were in when this President took office in terms of the economic recession, the depths of the recession we were in, was not going to be smooth every step of the way.\xc2\xa0 There would be bumps along the way.\xc2\xa0 Not every economic indicator would be fantastic every time it came out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What we have seen is a rebound in manufacturing, a sustained rebound in manufacturing, that is very promising. And even as Ron Bloom said yesterday, even the manufacturing report we got yesterday, while lower than we had anticipated or hoped, he believes that was largely due to some temporary factors like the supply chain disruption that occurred because of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, but also was still positive, was above 50, which is the indicator for positive growth in the manufacturing sector -- continuing a sustained trend of growth in manufacturing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Again, as I pointed out, seven straight quarters of economic growth -- all positive.\xc2\xa0 Not each quarter has been as robust as the next necessarily -- the numbers go up and down -- but it has been positive economic growth.\xc2\xa0 Sustained growth in private sector employment; 14 straight months; 2.1 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a heck of a turnaround from hemorrhaging 700,000 jobs a month.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not there yet.\xc2\xa0 We still have a lot of work to do.\xc2\xa0 There will be bumps in the road going forward.\xc2\xa0 But we believe we are headed in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 And if we do things like address deficit reduction in a responsible way so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t arrest the development, the positive growth that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen; if we -- and thereby send a signal, a positive signal, to the global economy and to markets around the world, then we can make progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If we do some of the things that the President talked about, in terms of investing in research and development and clean energy, investing in education, investing in infrastructure, we believe that we will have set the table for long-term positive economic growth.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up?\xc2\xa0 Back to Google.\xc2\xa0 Just one question.\xc2\xa0 Has the administration raised the hacking issue with China?\xc2\xa0 Or does it plan to do so?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make any specific comment about these reports.\xc2\xa0 The FBI has got the lead in this, has an investigation.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to confirm anything about origins except to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of the reports and are obviously concerned about cyber security and have taken action accordingly.\xc2\xa0 As a general principle, as you know, the President put forward a strategy on cyber security quite recently.\xc2\xa0 So beyond that I refer you to the FBI.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Mara.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the economy, I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re saying there are bumps in the road but the long-term trend is good.\xc2\xa0 So the administration is discounting any possibility of the recovery stalling?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t have crystal balls.\xc2\xa0 We have excellent analysts and economists, and we also look at the outside analysis.\xc2\xa0 And we believe what I think -- we agree with the consensus opinion out there that economic growth will continue, and we are -- and that job creation will continue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are doing everything we can to ensure that that happens and to take the measures necessary to ensure that it\xe2\x80\x99s not reversed and to do what we can to further spur growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 But, again, we can\xe2\x80\x99t on a week-by-week basis or a day-by-day basis predict what a certain economic indicator will show.\xc2\xa0 We can look at long-term trends.\xc2\xa0 And generally speaking, the long-term trends are very positive.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question about Boehner.\xc2\xa0 Was the meeting yesterday the first time that the President and Boehner have interacted since the Biden talks began?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 They may have spoken.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there have been any phone calls or any other --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can check.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, that would be great.\xc2\xa0 And then just one other quick question on Libya -- you said that you were glad that NATO extended the mission for 90 days.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think the mission should be continued until Qaddafi is out of power?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go beyond what the President has said, and that is that it is hard to imagine that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 will have been fulfilled as long as Qaddafi is in power and in any way in control of armed forces that are exerting their force against the civilian population of Libya.\xc2\xa0 And so he looks forward to the full implementation of 1973, and to the success of the other measures we have taken, including sanctions, and in success of the opposition in bringing us to the point where Muammar Qaddafi realizes that he will no longer be the ruler of Libya; that his people deserve a future that they can determine, a democratic future that they can determine.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the policy we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is there any kind of reiteration of the policy in terms of emailing and making sure that -- from the White House to agencies or to high-level employees, any kind of reiteration of the policy --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There haven\xe2\x80\x99t been any -- nothing that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of that\xe2\x80\x99s new on that front.\xc2\xa0 The guidance that we have is driven mostly by the Presidential Records Act, and I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here in terms of government email accounts, that we have no evidence -- no indication that those have been compromised or hacked.\xc2\xa0 And those are the ones that are guided by the Presidential Records Act.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Keith.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Libya, given that the United States is obviously the foremost military power within NATO, can you explain why it is that we are taking a backseat to the European powers?\xc2\xa0 Would the operation move more quickly if we were in charge of it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this numerous times a long time ago.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the President made clear that this was an important mission, and one of the reasons why it -- one of the reasons why it was worth doing was because we had international consensus that included our NATO partners as well as allies in the region participating in it.\xc2\xa0 And I think the fact that we have a broad international coalition and we have other countries through NATO taking a lead is a good thing and a positive thing in terms of our shared responsibility for dealing with issues like this around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that we cannot assume the burden for every action that needs to be taken around the world.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have alliances.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have partnerships.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have the United Nations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can follow up, I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the result of this, though, more killing in Libya?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about certain -- let me just finish --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s your misunderstanding, Keith.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about certain goals, like that it would be better if Qaddafi was removed.\xc2\xa0 So if more military force were brought to bear, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that abed the process of removing Qaddafi, of degrading the military forces --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Keith, you may have been on vacation when we had this debate.\xc2\xa0 But the United Nations --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, no, but the debate goes on, because there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that a lot of these things have not been accomplished, and if there were more military forces -- stronger military forces in the region, that these things might get accomplished more quickly.\xc2\xa0 I understand this is new, and this is what\xe2\x80\x99s going on now.\xc2\xa0 These things haven\xe2\x80\x99t happened.\xc2\xa0 Qaddafi is still there.\xc2\xa0 His forces are still able to fight.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tell me when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready for me to answer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are trying to -- well, you interrupted me before -- but we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to degrade these forces, and that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened quickly enough.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 does not allow for or call for regime change by force.\xc2\xa0 The coalition that is built around that resolution is built around the call for protection of civilians, enforcement of a no-fly zone, and enforcement of an arms embargo.\xc2\xa0 There is not an international coalition for military force to regime -- to force regime change.\xc2\xa0 That is a fact.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are taking other measures, as we have described numerous times, to put pressure on Qaddafi, using non-lethal means to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If you are arguing that the United States should unilaterally use force to use force to remove Muammar Qaddafi from power, that is an argument that can be made and others have made, but it is an agreement that this President does not agree with and that is not shared by many people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just lastly, I did not say unilaterally.\xc2\xa0 We are in a \xe2\x80\x9ckinetic\xe2\x80\x9d military action.\xc2\xa0 Why not apply the maximum kinesis to that action?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 To remove Qaddafi by force?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not just that.\xc2\xa0 And you said that was one of the ancillary things that could help the central goal, which is the U.N. resolution.\xc2\xa0 Why not apply maximum force to do that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because that\xe2\x80\x99s not called for under the Security Council resolution that we are operating under that is authorized --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The whole military operation -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not just talking about Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s removal.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You should have this debate in the op-ed pages somewhere.\xc2\xa0 I think our policy is clear.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, these are questions for you, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered them.\xc2\xa0 Let me move on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Andrei, pazhalsta.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Actually, if we follow up on this, are we still within the limits of the resolution, as defined by the Security Council?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 My real question was about the different set of Biden talks.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden is in Rome meeting international leaders, including ones from Georgia and Russia, presumably talking about the WTO.\xc2\xa0 What is the message?\xc2\xa0 What is he supposed to accomplish there from the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of conversations he might be having.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we support Russia\xe2\x80\x99s ascension into the WTO, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that he is having consultations aimed towards ensuring that that happens.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But both sides, I guess, Georgia and Russia, with whom he talks, present different ideas of what this is all about.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to give me your idea what this is all about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak for the Vice President while he\xe2\x80\x99s still in the process of having these conversations.\xc2\xa0 Obviously when he comes back and reports back and I can give a readout, I will.\xc2\xa0 But these are important meetings, part of an important element of our overall trade agenda, which includes working through the issues necessary to be worked through so that Russia can accede to the WTO.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you remain confident that this can be accomplished this year?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, April.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back on the email issue, we have a very complicated relationship with China.\xc2\xa0 How is the U.S. government working with China to deal with this cyber attack, this Google issue?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that I\xe2\x80\x99m not even going to comment on the reports about the origins of this cyber attack because we have -- the FBI is investigating it, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm or deny that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me ask you this -- well, okay, let me ask you this.\xc2\xa0 Were some of these emails emails that were existing prior to the Cabinet members coming into their current positions?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specifics about which email accounts might have been and whose -- I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s Gmail -- whose Gmail accounts might have been accessed.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details on that.\xc2\xa0 Again, the FBI is conducting the investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you can\xe2\x80\x99t give us anything?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t, and I actually in this case don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 The governor of Puerto Rico recently said that President Obama would visit soon.\xc2\xa0 It leaked last week that it would be on or around June the 14th.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, a lot of our -- my newspaper readers in Miami and throughout Florida are very interested in this.\xc2\xa0 This is 50 years after Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s visit.\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us about this visit to Puerto Rico?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no scheduling announcements to make.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us, beyond scheduling, which would involve a certain time and place and day, why the President would want to go to Puerto Rico?\xc2\xa0 What would that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of any possible scheduling announcement on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ann.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President yesterday with the Republicans actually say that he would like a deficit or a debt ceiling vote within a month\xe2\x80\x99s time?\xc2\xa0 Was he specific?\xc2\xa0 And why do the Blair House talks seem to be going so slow?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not even another session for another, what, week from today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a variety of reasons -- a lot of schedules that you have to synchronize to make these talks happen.\xc2\xa0 And we had a number of meetings; we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to have meetings.\xc2\xa0 I think the language you just used was not an assessment that anybody would have made until it came out of the mouth of one member yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Prior to that, the consensus was the talks had been productive and were moving along well.\xc2\xa0 We share that opinion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Obviously this is not easy stuff.\xc2\xa0 If these were easy issues to resolve we would have resolved them long ago.\xc2\xa0 And as I indicated yesterday, I can say with great confidence that not all of the disagreements that we have among our -- between us and the Republicans will be resolved through these talks.\xc2\xa0 But we do believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s enough common ground to be found if the members around the table are willing to find it, that we can reach an agreement on a significant bipartisan deficit reduction package and move forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you mentioned \xe2\x80\x9csolid progress\xe2\x80\x9d a few minutes ago, quoting someone else saying solid progress, have they actually agreed in the Blair House talks on specific areas where they will recommend cuts?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into specifics about it --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a way to quantify that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- but part of the reasons why I think --one of the reasons why they\xe2\x80\x99ve been successful is that people have gone about the business of negotiating very seriously and not making it a public back-and-forth in terms of the details.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of that process at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you been in touch with President Zuma of South Africa regarding some kind of a (inaudible) visit for Qaddafi?\xc2\xa0 Because he\xe2\x80\x99s the only leader who has seen him recently.\xc2\xa0 And do you think this could be an out -- a way out of the crisis in the absence of a change of regime?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve said about that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we know he traveled; there was a report that he traveled there.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve said anything about that, and so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is an alternative option --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We obviously are pleased to see any steps taken by any outside party that would lead to convincing Muammar Qaddafi of the fact, which is that his time in power is coming to an end.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran, I just wanted to ask you -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of tough talk on Iran.\xc2\xa0 We had Donilon\xe2\x80\x99s speech before the President\xe2\x80\x99s Middle East speech.\xc2\xa0 In the speech itself, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech to AIPAC, a lot of talk about Iran, the internal situation and suppression of rights, and on the nuclear issue.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what specific steps we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at in the next few months to achieve the goal of pressuring Iran regarding -- specifically regarding a nuclear program, which the President is talking --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new to bring to your attention in terms of steps we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been very clear about what we believe Iranian action has been, and the hypocrisy of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s pretending to support or its support for the popular unrest in other countries, even as it has brutally suppressed popular and peaceful demonstrations in its own country.\xc2\xa0 And we have maintained, along with the IAEA, about the grave concerns we have about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new to announce about what measures we\xe2\x80\x99re talking.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are a host of measures that are in place.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Connie, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much.\xc2\xa0 On both Pakistan and Syria, why should the U.S. trust the Pakistani intelligence services?\xc2\xa0 Why is the U.S. sharing intelligence with Pakistan?\xc2\xa0 And are you submitting (inaudible) $1.2 billion in (inaudible) to Pakistan?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I addressed a lot of these questions in the wake of the successful mission against Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 I think we have made clear that our cooperative relationship with Pakistan is important.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been complicated, obviously.\xc2\xa0 But it is vital to our successful effort against terrorism and terrorists.\xc2\xa0 The cooperation we\xe2\x80\x99ve received from Pakistan in the past has led to a variety of successes in our effort against terrorists.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to continuing that cooperative relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you trust and verify --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just think -- what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said is that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no secret to the fact that this is a complicated relationship and at times a difficult relationship, but it is an important relationship and one we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to because the cooperation between the United States and Pakistan, between our governments, our militaries, our security services, our intelligence services is so vital to America\xe2\x80\x99s national security interests.\xc2\xa0 And so because of that, we will continue to pursue it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Syria, is it U.S. policy that Assad must leave?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear that we condemn the actions that the Syrian President has taken, the violence he\xe2\x80\x99s perpetrated against peaceful protesters.\xc2\xa0 We have seen reports and hope the Syrian government delivers on its promise to release prisoners of conscience from Syrian jails.\xc2\xa0 But we in this case, going back to a phrase you just used, we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see action and not just rhetoric.\xc2\xa0 And we think that the most important thing is that the Syrian government stop shooting, brutalizing, harassing, arresting its citizens, and that it engage in a political dialogue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow on Pakistan?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On Gmail hacking, Chinese Foreign Ministry say that the accusation is ungrounded, it is -- and also unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the reaction from the White House?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I just want to reiterate what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, is that I am not confirming any of the reports, except that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them, we take cyber security very serious, and to refer you to the FBI, which is investigating this specific matter.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND 1:52 P.M.
