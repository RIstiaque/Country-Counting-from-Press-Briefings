PDT</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us this morning.\xc2\xa0 Later today, the President will deliver remarks in Los Angeles County at the Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park, where he will announce that he will use his executive authority under the Antiquities Act to designate approximately 346,000 acres of national forest land in the San Gabriel Mountains in Los Angeles County as the nation\xe2\x80\x99s newest national monument.</p>\n<p>With that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, will the President leave office without taking action to close Guantanamo prison?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Steve, I appreciate your question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to restate our policy here, which is that we continue to object to congressional restrictions, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear many times, including in our Statement of Administration Policy on the House-passed National Defense Authorization Act.</p>\n<p>Now, Steve, the President has been clear about the administration\xe2\x80\x99s strategy with respect to Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 To the greatest extent possible and consistent with our national security interests, detainees will be repatriated or resettled or prosecuted in federal courts or military-commissioned proceedings.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the administration will also continue to call on members of both parties to work together to ensure that Congress lifts the remaining restrictions and enables the closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xc2\xa0 So what is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position?\xc2\xa0 Are you looking now at bypassing Congress after the midterms in a way you haven\xe2\x80\x99t so far in order to close the facility?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we saw the statement earlier -- I understand that you\xe2\x80\x99re objecting to the notion of drafting options.\xc2\xa0 But putting that aside, is this a maneuver that politically you can\xe2\x80\x99t do before the midterms but you can do after the midterms?\xc2\xa0 And is your reluctance to broadcast it -- like you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say you\xe2\x80\x99re doing that, or is it not right?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any maneuvers to readout to you right now.\xc2\xa0 I would say -- but for many years now we\xe2\x80\x99ve always looked at options to close Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 For now, our position is clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking support from Congress to lift those restrictions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does \xe2\x80\x9cseeking\xe2\x80\x9d mean, though?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re seeking -- are there new phone calls?\xc2\xa0 Are there new briefings?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he said this within his first year of office that he would close it.\xc2\xa0 So is there something new?\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new briefings, phone calls to readout to you right now, but I can say that this is something important to the President, important to the administration, and something we are constantly working with Democrats and Republicans in Congress over.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no unilateral action being considered at this moment?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Like I said, we, for the past few -- for many years now, have always looked at options to do this.\xc2\xa0 Our position right now, our policy right now is seeking support from Congress to lift the restrictions that we feel are misguided.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have other questions, we\xe2\x80\x99re just typing frantically.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Take your time, I\xe2\x80\x99m here all day.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, I wanted to ask about North Korea.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been five weeks since the leader there has been seen, and this morning he missed some sort of big celebration that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t missed for the past three years.\xc2\xa0 So does the White House have any idea what\xe2\x80\x99s going on over there and with him?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Darlene.\xc2\xa0 We have seen those reports about Kim Jong-un\xe2\x80\x99s health and his absence at the event you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on this specifically.\xc2\xa0 I will say that given the DPRK\xe2\x80\x99s regime is one of the most opaque on this planet, it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that there is very little reliable and publicly available information about this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were reports this morning that militants were closing in closer to Baghdad and closer to the airport.\xc2\xa0 Anything on the President getting updated on that or just ISIS strategy, and if fears -- getting to the airport would obviously be a big deal?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As you know, we remain deeply concerned about the situation there.\xc2\xa0 Strikes were conducted last night, as announced by U.S. Central Command.\xc2\xa0 That included seven strikes around the city that destroyed -- around the city of Kobani that destroyed three ISIL vehicles, two ISIL training facilities, and damaged an ISIL tank.\xc2\xa0 These strikes also struck two ISIL units.</p>\n<p>As you know, Kimberly, the strikes were conducted as part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive strategy to degrade and destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 This destruction of targets in Syria and Iraq further limits the terrorist group\xe2\x80\x99s ability to lead, control and project power.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, sorry, can I go back just real quickly to Gitmo?\xc2\xa0 I want to understand -- you are not ruling out the possibility of unilateral action, you\xe2\x80\x99re just saying that right now you\xe2\x80\x99re seeking support from Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is we are seeking support from Congress.\xc2\xa0 That is our position right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say that you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling out unilateral action unless you tell me I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of jobs I want in life; being Margaret Talev\xe2\x80\x99s editor is not one of them.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, can I ask you about Syria?\xc2\xa0 The State Department said that Turkey has agreed to be part of the coalition, particularly in participating and the training of moderate rebels.\xc2\xa0 A couple questions.\xc2\xa0 Is that the most that you guys think you can get out of them?\xc2\xa0 Are they going to help at all in terms of taking on ISIL, protecting Kobani?\xc2\xa0 And Hagel had said today that you guys would like to use their airbase.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you think you can also get out of them?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Carol. \xc2\xa0Today, as you pointed out, General Allen and Deputy Envoy McGurk met with Turkish officials.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday they held constructive and detailed talks with Turkish officials, including the Prime Minister and NATO representatives -- actually, the NATO Secretary General.</p>\n<p>General Allen is currently en route back to Washington, and Brett McGurk is staying in the region for further consultations.\xc2\xa0 Nearly 12 hours of meetings with Turkish counterparts yesterday and followed this morning with Turkish General Staff helped align our strategic thinking against ISIL with this key NATO ally, Turkey.\xc2\xa0 As the State Department noted, Turkey has agreed to support train-and-equip efforts for the moderate Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 There is going to be a Defense Department planning team that goes out to the region to Ankara next week to continue planning on those channels.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the best you guys can do?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s adequate for a NATO ally who has a 500-mile border with Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Actually, the border is about 550 miles, and you are right that ISIL is obviously a threat to Turkey security.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there are few countries that have felt the ripple effect of the crises in Syria and Iraq as much as Turkey has.\xc2\xa0 To your broader question, I think the fact that Deputy Envoy McGurk is staying in the region and the Defense Department planning team is heading out there next week is an indication that conversations will be ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is not the -- basically, this is the floor, not the ceiling.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is not the best that you\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to get out of them?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, conversations are going to continue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to ask you on the Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any on-the-record guidance in the wake of reports that -- the latest wave of reports that it will be Perez?\xc2\xa0 I mean, on the record, is it true that no decisions have been made yet and that those reports are not accurate?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 On the record, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to engage in any personnel announcements at this time.\xc2\xa0 I will say the Attorney General over the past five and a half years has done tremendous work at the Department of Justice along with his entire team there.\xc2\xa0 But there is still a lot of work to be done.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why filling this post will be a priority for us, and as soon as we have an announcement to make, you all will be amongst the first to know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the timing changed at all?\xc2\xa0 There were a couple of reports this morning it was moved up, then moved back.\xc2\xa0 But just on the record, is the timing the same? \xc2\xa0It was going to take a while was sort of what we were understanding.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re right, I did see conflicting reports, and I will tell you I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on the timing for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think Perez would be a good Attorney General?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, Steve, good try.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to engage in speculation about personnel announcements.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Congressman Chaffetz up on the Hill is asking for all documents related to the White House Counsel review of the Cartagena situation in his office by October 24.\xc2\xa0 Do you see this as a reasonable request and one that you would meet?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Steve, my answer to this is going to be strikingly similar to the one yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Congressman Chaffetz\xe2\x80\x99s request and, as you know, as a general rule, we work hard to comply with requests that we seem -- Oversight requests that are legitimate.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific response to this one yet.</p>\n<p>I will say if you look at Congress\xe2\x80\x99s oversight heretofore into this matter, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that a bipartisan Senate committee, chaired by Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, found that there\xe2\x80\x99s no substantiation to the allegations you\xe2\x80\x99re referencing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the time after the President was briefed on the situation in Colombia, he I think referenced there were some knuckleheads or whatever in the situation.\xc2\xa0 Was he briefed on this potential incident with the White House advance staffer?\xc2\xa0 Is he aware of it?\xc2\xa0 Was he aware of it at the time and/or now</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I did get this question yesterday and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer in terms of that awareness.\xc2\xa0 I will tell you, again, when the White House completed its review several years ago when we were aware of an erroneous hotel log, a similar version of which falsely implicated a Secret Service agent who was subsequently exonerated, that review found that no members of the White House team, including the volunteer in question, had engaged in inappropriate conduct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If we\xe2\x80\x99re done with serious questions, did the President have a reaction to Gwyneth Paltrow telling him that he was quite handsome and that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak properly around him because of that</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a reaction to read out to you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We had a pretty early night last night when we ended.\xc2\xa0 Was there anything on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule that was not announced you can tell us about?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I do have a week ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he call Malala Yousafzai at some point?\xc2\xa0 I mean, she was in the Oval Office with him last year, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if he would telephone and actually speak to her and telephone his congratulations at some point.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Darlene.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any future calls to read out to you at this time, but I can tell you that, as I think we put out in the statement, the President and the First Lady issued a statement congratulating Malala Yousafzai on winning the Nobel Peace Prize.\xc2\xa0 As you pointed out, the President and First Lady were proud to welcome this remarkable young woman to the Oval Office last year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question.\xc2\xa0 The people that lived around Ms. Paltrow\xe2\x80\x99s house expressed deep anger today about how the neighborhood was all shut down last night and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get back to their houses.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have any response to these folks?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific awareness to the situation you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 I would say as a general matter I know the United States Secret Service works with local law enforcement to minimize inconvenience wherever the President travels.</p>\n<p>On the week ahead, I will tell you that on Monday, which is Columbus Day, the President has no public events.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the President will attend a DCCC event in the Washington, D.C., area.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the President will travel to Union, New Jersey, to attend a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee event.\xc2\xa0 In the evening, the President will travel to Bridgeport, Connecticut, for a campaign rally with Connecticut Democrats, featuring Governor Dan Malloy.</p>\n<p>And on Thursday, the President will travel to Rhode Island to deliver remarks on the economy.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just pause there to remind everyone today is 10/10.\xc2\xa0 Afterward, the President will travel to Long Island, New York, to attend a DNC event.</p>\n<p>And on Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa011:26 A.M.
