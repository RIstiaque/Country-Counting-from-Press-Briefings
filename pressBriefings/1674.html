MST</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Before I get my customary AP question, though this is off camera, we\'re going to change the rules and the briefing is on the record.\xc2\xa0 So let me bring out our participants.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 I\'m just going to start with the broad imperative:\xc2\xa0 Economic recovery requires actions on three fronts.\xc2\xa0 The President signed into law yesterday this very powerful package of investments and tax incentives to help keep people working, help businesses stay operating.\xc2\xa0 This is a absolutely necessary part of recovery.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a complement to that, we\'re going to have to take further actions to strengthen our financial system, to make sure it\'s providing the credit necessary to spur recovery.\xc2\xa0 You\'re going to see additional details from us in the coming weeks on how we\'re going to do that -- again, how we\'re going to make banks strong enough they can support recovery, how we\'re going to provide direct support for the credit markets that are so important to small businesses lending, to consumer lending.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These are necessary but not sufficient conditions to help address the housing crisis.\xc2\xa0 So the President is announcing today a very comprehensive plan of initiatives to help make housing more affordable and help, again, arrest this very damaging spiral we\'re seeing in the housing markets as a whole.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This program has three important parts.\xc2\xa0 Let me just walk through these very quickly.\xc2\xa0 The first is a program to allow Americans who cannot take advantage of lower interest rates today to refinance.\xc2\xa0 Right now if you\'re a -- got a typical mortgage, but the value of your house price has declined, you\'re not able to take advantage of lower interest rates.\xc2\xa0 So this program, which we think will reach between -- could reach between 4 and 5 million Americans -- will help people take advantage of lower interest rates and, in that context, provide substantial reductions in monthly payments.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second program is a $75 billion program of incentives and measures to help improve affordability of mortgage payments for those families most at risk of foreclosure.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My colleagues, Shaun Donovan and Sheila Bair will provide more details on that program.\xc2\xa0 You have a detailed fact sheet that shows how that works.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a combination of powerful incentives to lenders to participate and some conditions and other inducements to try to make it work.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This will reach between 3 and 4 million Americans.\xc2\xa0 Again, the focus is on improving affordability in mortgage payments for people at risk of losing their home.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The third important part is some additional financial support to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\xc2\xa0 These two institutions, in effect, are the mortgage market today.\xc2\xa0 They account for the vast bulk of mortgages originated today.\xc2\xa0 They play a critical role in these markets, and we need to make sure that they have the ability to play that role going forward.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'ve increased substantially, using the authority Congress provided the administration last summer, to increase our financial commitment.\xc2\xa0 This will be important to helping keep mortgage rates down and is a very critical, important part of recovery.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is -- all Americans have a stake in making this work, not just those Americans who were the victim of bad underwriting standards, or in communities where you\'ve seen -- foreclosure.\xc2\xa0 It has broad-based effects, again, by helping Americans take advantage of lower interest rates, and helping improve affordability, helping keep overall mortgage rates low.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Important to just emphasize the way this affects the economy as a whole:\xc2\xa0 Two important effects -- again, by helping keep mortgage rates down and helping reduce monthly payments, you\'re putting money in the hands of Americans.\xc2\xa0 In that case, it acts like stimulus.\xc2\xa0 Second is we\'re going to help reduce the risk that housing prices fall more than they would otherwise fall.\xc2\xa0 So again, by keeping interest rates low, by making it more affordable for people to stay in their homes, and by reducing the amount of foreclosures ahead, we can reduce the risk that housing prices fall further than they otherwise would.\xc2\xa0 Those two -- for those two reasons, again, all Americans have a stake in making this work.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is necessary policy.\xc2\xa0 It\'s smart economics.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s just and fair -- because Americans across the country that were responsible in how much they borrowed are being significantly damaged by the actions of those who are less responsible, both people who borrowed more than they could afford, and banks that took risks they didn\'t understand and could not sustain.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to end by complimenting Shaun Donovan, Sheila Bair, and a range of people across the administration who helped design this.\xc2\xa0 They both have enormous credibility in this area.\xc2\xa0 Sheila, I just want to say, was an early, powerful, pragmatic, creative advocate of action on the housing front.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m very pleased she was able to join the President and Shaun and I here today.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Shaun, do you want to add anything?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Tim.\xc2\xa0 As Tim has said, this is critical -- the announcement today is critical to getting the American economy back on the right path.\xc2\xa0 And let\'s be clear, housing has been a significant part of initiating the economic slide that we\'re in, and will be a key part of getting us out.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Close to 10 percent of all American families today are either in foreclosure or behind on their mortgages.\xc2\xa0 And to dramatize how important this is to the continuing slide in home prices that we see, estimates are that in December, 45 percent of all home sales were distressed sales -- 45 percent of all sales were distressed sales -- which is continuing to drive prices lower.\xc2\xa0 So we have to get out of that spiral.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here in Arizona, over 6 percent of all mortgages are more than 90 days late or in foreclosure -- so a crucial problem to be solved here, as well as across the country.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the first two pieces of the announcement that Secretary Geithner has talked about, between our refinancing initiative -- or so-called "underwater" borrowers -- and our modification plan, mortgage modification plan, we will reach between -- up to 7 to 9 million American families.\xc2\xa0 This is a smart, targeted investment which can reach and help to make more affordable more than $1.5 trillion of mortgage debt.\xc2\xa0 Those 7 to 9 million families hold roughly over $1.5 trillion in mortgage debt.\xc2\xa0 So we just have a scale that can have a real impact on turning the housing problems around in this country.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First of all, to focus on the refinancing portion, this will be focused on up to 4 to 5 million homeowners who have played by the rules, that have been making their payments on time.\xc2\xa0 These families have seen, through no fault of their own, values in their communities on houses drop by 20, 30, 40, even 50 percent, and find themselves in a situation where even if they\'re holding a mortgage that is far above market rates, they cannot take advantage of refinancing down to what are really historically low mortgage rates that we see in the market today.\xc2\xa0 This just isn\'t fair, and it\'s something that we will help to fix through the announcement today.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The typical family that has one of these so-called conforming mortgages, or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgages, that can re-fi to today\'s markets rates will save roughly $2,300 a year in lower interest payments, simply by refinancing to today\'s market rates.\xc2\xa0 And let me be clear:\xc2\xa0 These families have played by the rules; they\'re families that only have been victims of their houses falling in value and, therefore, their mortgages are close to or higher than the value of their homes today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the first.\xc2\xa0 The second is a mortgage modification plan, in many ways, based on the pioneering work that Sheila Bair did at FDIC, to show that a streamlined, large-scale modification plan can have major impacts.\xc2\xa0 It will reach between, we believe, up to 3 to 4 million American families.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s be clear about the scale here.\xc2\xa0 Our expectation is that -- we saw 2.2 million foreclosures, a record number, last year.\xc2\xa0 We expect to see as many as 6 million foreclosures in the coming years.\xc2\xa0 So between these two initiatives, reaching 7 to 9 million families is at a scale that can really begin to turn this problem around.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The modification program -- first of all, we must be clear that while this crisis in housing started as a mortgage crisis, in many ways, it has become a job-loss crisis, as well.\xc2\xa0 And so the signing yesterday of the recovery plan, which will create about 3.5 million jobs, is a critical piece of getting housing back on track by getting people back to work.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, this modification plan does a number of things to make sure that up to 3 to 4 million families can stay in their homes and have affordable mortgages.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First of all, it focuses on the right people:\xc2\xa0 investor-owners, flippers, speculators will not be eligible for the program; only owner occupants.\xc2\xa0 Second of all -- and this is something that is I think very innovative about this plan -- is that we are saying for the first time that any borrower that is current -- you don\'t have to be delinquent to qualify for this plan.\xc2\xa0 This is different from what\'s been done in the past.\xc2\xa0 What we\'ve found in our research is that the earlier we can get to homeowners that are in trouble, the more chance they have at successfully modifying their mortgage and being homeowners in the long term.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so we are providing new, innovative incentives for servicers to modify mortgages where people are current, where they haven\'t reached the state of 60 or 90 days delinquent, when they\'re more likely to fail.\xc2\xa0 And those again are the most deserving borrowers because they played by the rules, they struggled to make payments, but they have made those payments and they haven\'t been able to benefit from modification programs before.\xc2\xa0 So we are changing that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, we will provide a series of incentive payments for success both for owners where you can benefit from a $1,000-a-year payment up to five years -- if you\'re successful and succeed in your modification for up to five years, $5,000 that can reduce the principal on your home mortgage -- as well as incentive payments to servicers and lenders that if the modifications work over the years we will make payments to them as incentives to keep people current.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in all, this will help, as I said, 3 to 4 million families.\xc2\xa0 But let\'s be clear:\xc2\xa0 This will also help millions of other families, as well.\xc2\xa0 Recent research shows that neighboring homes to foreclosed homes lose as much as 9 percent of their value.\xc2\xa0 So people who are not in danger of foreclosure still are suffering from nearby foreclosures.\xc2\xa0 This will help those families, as well.\xc2\xa0 Our estimates are that the average home -- not the average home in foreclosure, but the average home across the country will gain $6,000 in value relative to had this plan not been put in place.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, the third leg of this plan which Tim has talked about, keeping the GSEs providing low interest mortgages is absolutely key.\xc2\xa0 Together with FHA they represent more than 90 percent of the mortgage market today, all new mortgages issued. Combined with the $8,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit that was in the recovery bill signed yesterday, we believe these efforts can help to prop up the housing market and return it to stability.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. BAIR:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just like to thank the President and Secretary Geithner and Donovan, and Larry Summers in absentia, for the leadership they have shown in putting this package together so early in the new administration.\xc2\xa0 They\'re committing real resources to this problem.\xc2\xa0 And the FDIC has long felt that the missing link really in all of our strategies so far is we\'ve not tackled the problem at the core, which is at-risk borrowers, millions of unnecessary foreclosures weighing down home prices and creating a lot of external costs for neighborhoods, communities, and the economy as a whole.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that missing link is being filled today in a way that I think is effective and responsible.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a program of shared responsibility, looking to servicers, investors, borrowers, as well as the government, to all work together and make a contribution to get these loans restructured.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It aligns economic incentives in the right way.\xc2\xa0 Because of the securitization features, where a lot of these at-risk mortgages are held, economic incentives have been skewed, so that loan restructurings that make sense, that are more valuable than a foreclosed home, have not been happening.\xc2\xa0 And with this package the economic incentives should be aligned so that those loan restructurings that make economic sense and are viable will occur.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I would just like to thank again the new administration for their leadership in getting this done, being willing to commit real resources to it. \xc2\xa0And I\'d be happy to answer any questions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been hearing $50 billion and now today we\'re talking $75 [billion].\xc2\xa0 Why the increase there?\xc2\xa0 And also, if you\'re doubling the financial guarantees for Freddie and Fannie, does that mean that you have a more dire view of their books and the state they\'re in?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 The $75 billion because we think that\'s necessary to make a program like this work.\xc2\xa0 We wanted to make sure we were putting enough resources into this that we were going to achieve as much as possible.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Fannie and Freddie front, again, you should view this as underscoring our commitment to stand behind these institutions so that they can play this critical role going forward.\xc2\xa0 This is not a judgment about the expected losses ahead; it\'s just a way to make sure people understand that they will be able to play this role going forward.\xc2\xa0 It underscores a commitment to make sure they can do that.\xc2\xa0 And that is very important to try to help keep mortgage rates low.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President talked in his speech about the inter-relatedness of the mortgage crisis, the banking crisis and the economy.\xc2\xa0 So I want to ask you, do you think there will be fewer bank failures as a result of this specific housing plan?\xc2\xa0 And then also I have a technical question:\xc2\xa0 Are there any income limits on the incentives for borrowers, or is anybody eligible for them if they\'re underwater?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 Okay, let me start with the first.\xc2\xa0 All these things are closely related.\xc2\xa0 The recovery act, which is a very powerful set of investments and -- is not going to be as forceful if we have a financial system that\'s not providing credit to businesses and consumers.\xc2\xa0 So those two things work together.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If those things are effective that will help make sure that people can -- because they\'re not losing their jobs -- more likely to stay in their home.\xc2\xa0 They\'ll also help support the housing crisis as a whole.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we think that alongside those things you need to get directly to the housing thing, too.\xc2\xa0 As Sheila Bair said, I think, the cost of inaction on this front has been very severe.\xc2\xa0 So you\'re absolutely right -- you need to think about these things together.\xc2\xa0 Each will be more effective if you\'re moving with as much creativity and careful design force as we can, each will be more effective moving together.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now on the --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- overall banking plan more effective.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 More people will stay in their homes if fewer people lose their jobs.\xc2\xa0 Banks will be stronger if fewer people lose their jobs.\xc2\xa0 House prices will fall less than they otherwise would if you have a stronger economy and a financial system that\'s working better to support recovery.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, on the issue about qualification.\xc2\xa0 These programs are targeted to people that, again, were relatively responsible.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not going to be directed at helping those who borrowed just huge amounts of money, well beyond their capacity to repay, and it\'s not going to go -- it\'s not going to be targeted at those people who really don\'t need the assistance, have very substantial amounts of equity in their home and, therefore, are able to refinance, take advantage of lower interest rates.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'s targeted to those people really in the middle and to make sure, again, they can refinance to take advantage of lower interest rates and they can take advantage of lower mortgage payments and, therefore, are more likely to be able to stay in their home, afford their home.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about income -- just to follow up -- there are people who are struggling in San Francisco with million-dollar mortgages, even though they have two incomes and things like that.\xc2\xa0 Would they be -- would any of those people be eligible?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 The program does have a limit on mortgages that are below what we call the conforming loan limits, which were -- just in the recovery bill signed yesterday, were maintained at a higher level than they have typically been.\xc2\xa0 The highest -- they vary around the country, depending on home prices -- up to just over $700,000.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, only about 2 percent of mortgages around the country are above that, but we want to try and make sure that this assistance is not targeted at millionaire homes, homes where we, frankly, don\'t think that assistance is needed, that it\'s targeted to people who really do need the assistance.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just mention one other thing on your question about the help to the banking system.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Secretary Geithner is focused on the entire banking system.\xc2\xa0 But within the homeownership market you hear about these toxic assets -- well, these toxic assets are really toxic mortgages in housing.\xc2\xa0 And there are two fundamental problems.\xc2\xa0 One is it\'s been hard to value these mortgages.\xc2\xa0 This plan helps because it establishes a standardized net present value test, which will be released on March 4th when we release the broader guidance that we\'re going to put in place as part of this plan.\xc2\xa0 That will help to create a more standardized system to value these mortgages across the country and take some of the uncertainty away.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other thing, frankly, is the reason they\'ve been toxic is because families haven\'t been able to pay.\xc2\xa0 And so this will take millions of mortgages that currently aren\'t affordable to families and make them affordable.\xc2\xa0 That will also help to stabilize the balance sheets of these banks, as well.\xc2\xa0 So those are two key points.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s kind of a technical one -- the $10 billion -- is that part of the $75 billion, or is it an additional dollar amount?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 It\'s part of the $75 billion total cost.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the $10 billion coming from TARP?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you able to enact this just by executive order, or do you have to go through a legislative process?\xc2\xa0 And then I have a follow-up.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 We\'re using authority that already exists for the bulk of these initiatives, although an important part is some changes to the HOPE for Homeowners program.\xc2\xa0 And there is legislation now pending before Congress that would help strengthen that program, make it more effective.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are other pieces of the program, too, that require legislation, like the bankruptcy reform provisions.\xc2\xa0 But the core parts of this program -- to improve affordability, to help people refinance -- are using authority Congress has already provided.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, I know you\'re trying to realign the incentives.\xc2\xa0 But how do you respond to critics who say that when it comes to especially the pay for success program, that you\'re providing rewards for things that lenders and borrowers -- I\'m sorry -- lenders and lendees already should be doing because of the extraordinary measure the government is taking?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 You\'ve seen a lot of experience over the last year or so -- people try other approaches to help fix this problem, and they are not working.\xc2\xa0 So what we try to do is put together a more powerful package of incentives and other inducements, I\'ll call them, to try to make sure you get a level of participation and a level of relief in mortgage payments that has not been achieved. \xc2\xa0We haven\'t even begun yet.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this represents our best judgment of that.\xc2\xa0 And you have to look at those costs against the very substantial benefits this will bring to homeowners across America and to the overall economy as a whole.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any aspects of the plan that could work right away?\xc2\xa0 There was an official who said March 4th as a possible guideline.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to put out the detailed guidelines on March 4th.\xc2\xa0 We expect people to go ahead and continue modifying today. \xc2\xa0And although it will take a little longer for the entire operation or architecture of this thing to be in place, modifications done as of March 4th will benefit from these financial incentives.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is going to work, our judgment is, really quite quickly.\xc2\xa0 You\'ll start to see the effects quite quickly, really a extraordinarily rapid pace for a program -- for an administration this early in office.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A senior administration official says 23 percent of the nation\'s mortgages are underwater right now. \xc2\xa0Does that mean that most people who bought homes in the past couple of years are now underwater?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 It is true that a substantial number of families -- you can see in our program, there\'s 4 to 5 million Americans who have had the value of their homes decline and therefore cannot refinance, take advantage of lower interest rates.\xc2\xa0 And this program will help those.\xc2\xa0 And there was no program on the table in prospect before this program to be directly affected those families -- at those families.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s very important.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, there are other families who have much, much higher levels of mortgages outstanding relative to the value of their home, that this program should not reach, really cannot reach.\xc2\xa0 So it won\'t reach all homeowners.\xc2\xa0 It won\'t prevent all foreclosures.\xc2\xa0 And it can\'t really help a range of people who were -- got themselves in the position where they had just borrowed way, way beyond their means.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shaun, do you want to add to this?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Excuse me, if 23 percent of the nation\'s homes are underwater, and you hope to help 9 million -- 7 to 9 million -- how many people won\'t this reach?\xc2\xa0 What percentage of 23 percent of the nation\'s homes is 7 to 9 million?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 A couple things I would say on that.\xc2\xa0 One of the problems is there is no good accurate information about exactly the value of these homes.\xc2\xa0 So there are estimates like the 23 percent that you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 One of the features of this plan is to try and create through standardized guidance that will be issued by Treasury that will apply not just to Fannie and Freddie, not just to FHA, but across the mortgage market in general, to try to get a more standardized process for valuing these mortgages.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s a critical piece of it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we are all -- there are a couple different groups of homeowners within those who are underwater.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not just the 4 to 5 million that Secretary Geithner talked about that are currently in conforming mortgages that are underwater that will benefit.\xc2\xa0 You also have a group of homeowners who are part of the 3 to 4 million -- that are included in the 3 to 4 million that we will help, as well, who are both underwater and have affordability problems.\xc2\xa0 Those will benefit, as well.\xc2\xa0 So all of the folks who are being helped today through those first two initiatives are part of that group.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, finally, recognize that HOPE for Homeowners is a program that, if we can get legislative changes, will help underwater borrowers.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, allowing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to continue to be active at lower interest rates, because of the support that we\'re providing, will help a large share of those homeowners, as well.\xc2\xa0 So I think the scale of the plan that we got through the various components is adequate to get to the scale of folks who are underwater.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to be able to bring every one of those borrowers to a point where they have equity in their homes.\xc2\xa0 But at least we can make sure they benefit from refinancing, lower their payments, and get to an affordable level in their home.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You suggested that there would be help for people with non-conforming loans.\xc2\xa0 I thought that there was not.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 To be clear, the modification program that is being announced today will allow any servicer who -- whether that loan is a conforming loan with the GSEs, or it is held by a private label security -- any type of loan as long as the servicer and the investor are willing to step up, they have some skin in the game, so to speak, they\'re willing to bring the payments down to 38 percent what we call DTI -- debt to income ratio -- we will provide incentives.\xc2\xa0 We will split 50/50 the reduction of those payments down from 38 percent to 31 percent.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So any loan, whether it\'s a GSE loan or not, can participate in that program.\xc2\xa0 And those homeowners who are underwater and also can\'t afford to pay their mortgages can participate.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- respect to the lender?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, we do have guidance --\xc2\xa0 as Secretary Geithner said earlier, we have guidance as part of TARP, that anyone receiving TARP funding must participate in this program.\xc2\xa0 And we have a range of incentives that will make sure that servicers who have not been able to participate before can do so.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\'s be clear:\xc2\xa0 One of the problems is these securities that hold many of these loans are so complex -- they\'ve been sliced and diced into so many pieces -- that they are lots of problems for servicers that have a financial incentive to modify, but they haven\'t been able to do that.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re going to provide standardized guidance across all the mortgage market that defines what a reasonable modification is.\xc2\xa0 That will provide a lot of comfort to these servicers who have been concerned about lawsuits.\xc2\xa0 That\'s first of all.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second of all, we\'re going to provide the incentives that I talked about before, so there\'s a financial incentive to participate.\xc2\xa0 And third, a program which really Sheila Bair has been a leader on -- we\'re going to provide this insurance pool -- the $10 billion insurance pool -- to make sure that future price declines aren\'t a reason for servicers to not participate.\xc2\xa0 Right now, many are afraid if they modify and home prices fall further, that they\'re going to lose from that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to help ensure against that so we get greater participation, as well.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We think the combination of the carrots and the sticks will be effective in getting much greater participation.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sheila, do you want to add on this?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. BAIR:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I just need to clarify, there\'s a difference between a conforming loan and a loan under the conforming limit.\xc2\xa0 So the loans, the modification, "do they have to be below the conforming limit?"\xc2\xa0 That doesn\'t mean they have to be conforming loans.\xc2\xa0 A lot of them are not.\xc2\xa0 A lot of the high-risk mortgages are in these private label securitizations.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I guess to go back also to an earlier question about, well, why pay them for doing something that makes economic sense already.\xc2\xa0 And I can assure you, our hands-on experience when we became conservator of IndyMac and we\'re dealing with the investors to try to get those loans modified in the servicing portfolio of IndyMac, and there were two key problems.\xc2\xa0 One, is that investors have different interests.\xc2\xa0 If you reduce the interest rate on these loans, some investors get hurt by that, some get help.\xc2\xa0 If you foreclose, some get hurt, some get help.\xc2\xa0 So the economic incentives are misaligned.\xc2\xa0 The servicer has no skin in the game at all, right?\xc2\xa0 So there\'s inertia there to begin with.\xc2\xa0 The investors are pushing different ways, perhaps threatening lawsuits.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think what we\'re trying to do is align economic incentives by saying, if you come this far for us, 38 percent, then we\'ll help with the interest deduction between 38 and 31.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll also give you some protection.\xc2\xa0 We know home prices are going down.\xc2\xa0 We know that some of these loans will redefault -- may redefault later and you will have to take a loss because the foreclosure value will be less.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re going to give you some additional insurance, guarantee against that.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those are the two huge issues that we\'ve heard from investors over and over again.\xc2\xa0 And we think -- it would be nice if it happened voluntarily.\xc2\xa0 We tried voluntary.\xc2\xa0 It didn\'t work.\xc2\xa0 And we are woefully behind the curve.\xc2\xa0 So I think this program is necessary.\xc2\xa0 I think it does have the right incentives that should get the job done.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These modifications, though, absolutely make business sense.\xc2\xa0 At IndyMac, we -- even assuming a 40 percent redefault rate, which is very high, higher than we think -- we\'re still making $50,000 on average for every loan we modify, just because the value of a performing loan is so much higher than that of a foreclosed home.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is -- this makes economic sense.\xc2\xa0 It will help the economy.\xc2\xa0 It will help stabilize home prices and prevent us from overshooting, which I think we are in a distinct danger of doing right now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s my understanding that this only applies to first mortgages, so that if you had a second -- a first mortgage and you\'re not technically underwater with it, but you are with your first and second combined, you\'re not eligible for assistance, correct?\xc2\xa0 And why not?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not correct, actually.\xc2\xa0 We do have one element of the program that says if your total debt, including second lien but also credit card and other debt, is more -- your payments on all that debt is more than 55 percent of your income, then we think you\'re very unlikely to succeed.\xc2\xa0 And therefore, we\'re going to require those families to go into counseling to try and reduce their other debts, and then they could become eligible for the program.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 If they want to benefit from the program, we\'re going to have to do something to reduce their overall debt.\xc2\xa0 What we don\'t want is to provide a modification that\'s set up for failure.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that we\'re setting people up to succeed.\xc2\xa0 So if their overall household debt is too high, that\'s going to be a requirement to be able to participate in the program, if they want to get the -- but on second liens, you are eligible to participate.\xc2\xa0 And what we have generally seen is that the second liens on modifications are not a problem to participation, because no payments are made to the second liens whatsoever under this program.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to focus on getting affordability.\xc2\xa0 Their payments have to get down to the 31 percent level.\xc2\xa0 And we will not be making payments to those second liens, because, frankly, they\'re not -- they don\'t have a value in this case if the homeowner can\'t even afford to pay the first mortgage.\xc2\xa0 So no payments will be made.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been in extensive discussions with the servicing community; we don\'t believe that\'s going to be an issue for the program and they will be able to participate.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How quickly are you going to go push this bankruptcy change in Congress?\xc2\xa0 Is it --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 We\'re working with the leadership in Congress to find a appropriate way to move that forward, and we\'re working on it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is it weeks, months?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 We\'re working on it.\xc2\xa0 We\'re trying to find the best path to early enactment.\xc2\xa0 And we want to have a carefully defined package of reforms.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you said, there are millions of people who ultimately could be eligible for this help, and they\'re all wondering how do I go about doing this?\xc2\xa0 Can you in a concise way explain who is eligible for this and who absolutely would not be eligible for the various forms of these programs?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 So you are eligible if your debt-to-income ratio -- in other words, the payments that you have to make on your mortgage -- are above 31 percent of your income; if the size of your mortgage -- and Sheila\'s clarification is important -- the size of your mortgage is below the amount of the conforming loan limits.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t have to be a GSE loan, but it has to be below that limit, which varies across the country depending on home prices.\xc2\xa0 And you have to have a reasonable chance of success as measured by whether your mortgage is underwater.\xc2\xa0 In other words, if you\'re so far underwater, more than about 150 percent loan-to-value, we think you\'re very unlikely to succeed -- those will not be eligible, as well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You answered part of my question.\xc2\xa0 So the lower threshold on refinancing is loan-to-value of 150 [percent]?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 In other words, if you\'re over 150 percent loan-to-value right now you\'re not eligible for the program.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one point, one thing that\'s not in the list is being delinquent.\xc2\xa0 Programs have typically required 90-day delinquency.\xc2\xa0 We believe that we have to move this modification process earlier to help people be successful.\xc2\xa0 And so we do not have a requirement that you have to be delinquent.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we have incentive payments to try to bring non-delinquent borrowers in, because we think we have a better chance of success.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From 38 down to 31 -- does that include principal, as well, or just interest?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 That is up to the servicer.\xc2\xa0 We are willing to match payments for principal reduction or interest reductions or extending out the term.\xc2\xa0 Whatever the combination is that can get payments down to 31 percent, that\'s critical.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen a lot of modifications that have failed because they\'ve actually increased payments rather than reduced payments.\xc2\xa0 So getting payments to 31 percent debt-to-income ratio is critical.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did hear you say that you\'re eligible -- not eligible if the size of your mortgage is below the amount -- or has to be below the amount of the conforming limits.\xc2\xa0 I thought you just said in an earlier answer that the non-conforming mortgages were eligible.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, two different things.\xc2\xa0 A conforming mortgage is a Fannie Mae or a Freddie Mac mortgage.\xc2\xa0 Conforming loan limit is a dollar figure, okay?\xc2\xa0 So what we\'re saying is, very large mortgages aren\'t eligible.\xc2\xa0 Smaller mortgages are eligible whether they are Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgages or other kinds of mortgages.\xc2\xa0 Sorry about that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the definition of that?\xc2\xa0 Because in New York or San Francisco, very large is very large -- but, I mean, there\'s different levels --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 And we\'d be happy to provide more detail to you.\xc2\xa0 It varies across the country, depending on what home prices -- the maximum is about $730,000 in the highest-priced areas.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a relatively complex formula I don\'t want to bore you with, but we\'d be happy to get you what those numbers are across the country.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\'s a regional --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there\'s a regional variation, depending on home price, exactly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Three very factual questions.\xc2\xa0 First, does the $75 billion come from the TARP money, the second tranche of the $350 billion of TARP money?\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Most of it but not all of it is from the TARP.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where is the rest from?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Part of the way that we\'re going to implement this program, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will do modifications of their own loans that qualify in this program.\xc2\xa0 And we are not providing TARP funds to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for modifying their mortgages.\xc2\xa0 But obviously that has a cost to them to modify them, and we are including that in the $75 billion that will be dedicated to doing that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And secondly, you said you would expect about 6,000 foreclosures in the coming years.\xc2\xa0 Can you be specific about the coming -- what do you mean by "the coming years"?\xc2\xa0 And also, again, can you give us your best estimate of how many people will still go into foreclosure despite this effort?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 So, two things.\xc2\xa0 Roughly 6 million foreclosures is expected over the next three years.\xc2\xa0 Those estimates vary, depending on -- but that\'s, we think, a good estimate at this point, without implementing this program.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We believe we can help a very large share of these.\xc2\xa0 It\'s going to depend on participation in the program.\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, between 7 and 9 million homeowners, families can benefit from the modification and the refinancing program.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s a substantial scale.\xc2\xa0 What\'s impossible to predict is exactly how many of those 7 to 9 million families would go into foreclosure.\xc2\xa0 But we think we can get to a majority of the foreclosures.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me also be clear:\xc2\xa0 There are speculators who are not owner occupants who will continue into foreclosure because this program is not targeted for them.\xc2\xa0 There are families, frankly, whose debt is so high that even with this modification we\'re not going to be able to help them.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that we do with our plan is to provide incentives for those families to be able to transition out of homeownership in a way that doesn\'t hurt them and doesn\'t hurt the communities around them.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do I mean by that?\xc2\xa0 Right now a foreclosure hurts their credit rating, makes it very hard for them to ever buy a home again, and also hurts surrounding communities because those homes tend to sit for months vacant, lowering prices of surrounding homes.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ve provided incentives for transitions short of foreclosure, like deed in lieu, or short sales, through this plan as well.\xc2\xa0 So we believe even for those who are headed towards foreclosure, we\'ve provided tools that will limit the impacts on families and on communities, and help to limit the decline in housing prices in surrounding communities.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 Can I just add one thing on this?\xc2\xa0 It\'s just important to recognize that one of the biggest factors that effects the level of foreclosures is what happens to the economy as a whole and what happens to the path of unemployment.\xc2\xa0 So these programs will address part of that risk.\xc2\xa0 But overall path of foreclosures is hugely dependent on how quickly we get growth back, how quickly we get job creation back on track.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, does having Fannie and Freddie endorse these loans or continue to be involved in loans where people are below 20 percent increase their exposure in the long term?\xc2\xa0 Have you tried to do any estimate of that?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be good for them in the long term in your estimate?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other question is on the investors and speculators.\xc2\xa0 How are you sure that these aren\'t investors and speculators, and could there be second homes that are eligible for this program?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 On the first, Fannie and Freddie believe that the program we announced, this refinancing program is economically sensible for them and will leave them overall in\xc2\xa0 a better position going forward.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As Shaun said, I think Sheila said, too, to be eligible this has to -- you have to be in an owner-occupied home.\xc2\xa0 And that simple test will reduce the risk that any investors or second homes would benefit from the program.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Second homes are not eligible.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is that verified?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 It will be verified.\xc2\xa0 It\'s easily verifiable.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 The first is on the second part of the program, will people apply for the help, or will the servicers suggest the help to their debtors?\xc2\xa0 And is the interest rate</div> <div class="legacy-para">-- by changing interest rates alone, will that be enough to get all these people to 31 percent of their income?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 On the first -- Shaun or Sheila may approve this, but you want -- for this to work, borrowers are going to have to take the initiative to approach their lenders to try to take advantage of the program.\xc2\xa0 And you want servicers to take a more proactive approach to contact borrowers who are at risk and where it may make economic sense for everyone for them to be in.\xc2\xa0 So you need to have both those two things happen.\xc2\xa0 And this program creates pretty powerful incentives for initiative by the servicers to move.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On your second point --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 You can come and initiate that process.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s a variety of -- to make that easier, easier to happen more quickly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On your second part of your question, as Shaun said, you can bring those mortgage payments to 31 percent through a mix of interest rate reductions, principal reductions, or extensions of the loan.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re trying to incent and help that actually happen.\xc2\xa0 And whatever mix works is okay.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the principal, as well?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, just one more thing.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that Fannie and Freddie can sort of -- are they strong enough to absorb this much new responsibility?\xc2\xa0 Are you at all concerned about their ability to handle --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 They are confident they can handle this.\xc2\xa0 And they have a substantial economic incentive in doing so.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) -- foreclosures are skyrocketing.\xc2\xa0 And the number one thing we hear from homebuyers, homeowners struggling:\xc2\xa0 lenders won\'t play ball.\xc2\xa0 So I hear the incentive, and then I hear TARP involvement.\xc2\xa0 Are there penalties for lenders if they don\'t participate?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, as Shaun said, you\'re seeing there\'s a, I think, pretty powerful set of incentives,
