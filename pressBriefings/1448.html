GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, guys.\xc2\xa0 Sorry we pushed it back a couple of times -- the President ran a little late this morning in some meetings and wanted to make sure the pool had access to this without stepping on this.</p>\n<p>So, Phil, take us away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us about the decision to split up the President\'s trip to Copenhagen and Oslo?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\'ve known the dates on both of these for a while, so why the need to reschedule?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President believed -- we announced the trip prior to Oslo, believing that talks in Copenhagen would be good for the President to go and give some momentum to those talks at the beginning of the period -- I think it\'s going to last upwards of 11 or 12 days -- in Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>Based on developments, primarily with the Chinese and the Indians, I think everybody agrees that we are in a better position -- I mean, "we," globally -- to get some sort of agreement out of Copenhagen.\xc2\xa0 And the President believed, having helped to work both in enunciating our commitments, as well as ensuring that the Indians and the Chinese talked about their commitments, that we could move that to the end of the conference when some agreement is likely to need some help from world leaders.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much help is the U.S. position going to get from the EPA decision today to classify greenhouse gases as a pollutant?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Phil, this was set into motion by a 2007 Supreme Court decision, Massachusetts v. EPA, which ruled -- which ruling set in motion the scientific process to determine whether the public health was threatened by carbon dioxide as a pollutant.</p>\n<p>The President continues to strongly believe that the best way forward is through the passage of comprehensive energy legislation, the type of which previously passed the House and is being considered now on the Senate side; that the best way to move forward is through the legislative process, understanding that the Court ruled that some action had to be taken based on the lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the timing looks politically convenient.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The timing is based on the fact that the first step of this process is being completed.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions.\xc2\xa0 One on the EPA and one on Oslo; I\'ll start with Oslo.\xc2\xa0 Will the President mention Afghanistan and the troop increase during his speech accepting the Nobel Peace Price?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us the flavor what he\'ll say?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get ahead of him on this, but, look, suffice to say, Jeff, it would be -- the President is under no -- will address directly the notion I think that many have wondered, which is the juxtaposition of the timing for the Nobel Peace Price and his commitment to add more troops into Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That\'s obviously something that he will address.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He is accepting the Nobel Peace Prize as a war President.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On the EPA issue, will the negotiators who are there now and President Obama when he arrives next week not mention the fact that if legislation to cut greenhouse gases does not come through the Senate next year, that they have this in their hand as a backup?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, again, going back to what I said to Phil, that process was set in motion by the Supreme Court\'s ruling on a lawsuit in 2007.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think what our administration would say -- and I think when the President meets later in the week with business leaders that are supportive of comprehensive clean energy legislation that puts America at the forefront of creating millions of jobs based on clean energy, that we do so -- we do so through the legislation process, that that\'s what\'s important.\xc2\xa0 And quite frankly, we have the ability to do that.</p>\n<p>I think what the President would say, and I think what everyone would say, is the power to control the solution to this is indeed in our hands; we just have to act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\'s nice to have the EPA in your back pocket.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, this was set in motion, what, more than -- almost two years ago.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the exact date, it would have been more than two years ago because of the Supreme Court\'s rulings would have come down before December.\xc2\xa0 This was set by a court two years ago.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The report that the administration is sending to Congress today -- that we made public on Wednesday -- about the TARP money, one of the less -- one of the parts of the report that the administration hasn\'t been talking about as much is the fact that it looks like the taxpayers will lose about $30 billion from the AIG leak, deal, bailout, and about $30 billion from the automakers bailout.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the message that the President has for the American people about that $60 billion likely being lost?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Jake, we\'re -- I think the President would say in any dealings with TARP that collectively some very tough decisions were made to stabilize the financial system over the course of now a couple of different years.\xc2\xa0 Nobody liked having to make those decisions, but the President believed, and the leaders that made those decisions before the President got here believed that steps had to be taken in order to stabilize the financial system.</p>\n<p>What\'s important are a couple of things going forward, and that is, first and foremost, that we get financial reform, so that when you have something like an AIG, an insurance company with a hedge fund perched on top of it, that using resolution authority you can break those two entities apart in order to stabilize the financial system and ensure that one does not unduly harm the other.</p>\n<p>But, again, Jake, I think he would reiterate that we\'ve regrettably made -- had to make some tough decisions.\xc2\xa0 We have on some of these payments gotten repaid by banks and gotten repaid with interest.\xc2\xa0 But we had to make some tough decisions to ensure the security and stability, ultimately, of the financial system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the same thing with the automakers?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think so.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, the President -- again, not an easy or -- not a decision that he probably believed he would be making, but the President believed that it was important to use a portion of that money to help stabilize GM and Chrysler and put them on a path towards sustainability by themselves.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve already seen that through recent auto sales figures that some progress is indeed being made on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On NATO troops, as you know, a lot of the international contributions to the troop levels in Afghanistan come with very --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Some of them do.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not -- I don\'t -- some of them do, some don\'t, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Come with constraints.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Caveats, right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Caveats about no fighting in the south, no flying at night, no combat.\xc2\xa0 Are you working, is the administration working to change that so it\'s not just a few countries that are willing to put troops in harm\'s way?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, first and foremost, Jake, we are pleased by the international effort that has NATO increasingly stepping up to meet international commitments.\xc2\xa0 I think what you will hear and see from commanders on the ground from our perspective is we can take -- now we can take troops in other parts of the country and focus them on more in the south and the east as others come in to fill more of the north and the west.</p>\n<p>I think what you see as a result of the President\'s engagement on this policy is a hefty international commitment that will help meet an international problem.\xc2\xa0 I think I\'ve said and the President has said numerous times that this is not one country or one region\'s problem -- this is an international problem.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re quite pleased with the steps that the international community has taken to meet those commitments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it not be more fair or more in keeping with NATO\'s charter and more in keeping with the statement you just made about how this is an international obligation, not just a Western obligation, for other countries to be willing to send troops to engage in combat with the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, quite a few are and we\'re pleased that they\'re -- that they will be adding to those commitments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but I\'m asking about the ones who aren\'t.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, certain people have, again, certain caveats that are there.\xc2\xa0 Suffice to say, though, we can find ways -- COMISAF can find ways to use those troops.\xc2\xa0 We can pull -- some of those troops obviously will be used for training, either of the Afghan national army or ultimately the Afghan national police.\xc2\xa0 And without that training, without meeting the force requirements for an Afghan national security force, it gets harder for Afghans to ultimately assume responsibility.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got obviously some very important goals that commanders believe can be met, and these troops will help us do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on troops, I want to talk about the U.S. forces.\xc2\xa0 Admiral Mullen a short time ago was making public comments and said that July 2011 is not a deadline.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that statement?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think Secretary Gates said that yesterday and then followed that by saying, what that is, is the date by which -- the date on which a transition will begin of our forces handing security responsibility over to the Afghans.\xc2\xa0 Understand, July 2011 comes from the Pentagon and Admiral Mullen.\xc2\xa0 So I think the Pentagon gave to, as part of the process that concludes, gave to the security team a series of ideas that included July 2011 as the transition date.</p>\n<p>And I\'ll tell you this -- I talked to the President as recently as this morning on this -- as the Commander-in-Chief, he\'s clear about what July 2011 means.\xc2\xa0 That is the point in which we will transition handing the security responsibility for Afghanistan to the Afghans, understanding that, as the President said a little under a week ago in West Point, the trajectory with which that withdrawal will happen will be based on, appropriately, conditions on the ground, as has happened in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why, if it\'s clear, did General Jones yesterday say that this is a ramp and the troops start coming off --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s exactly what I just said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but then General Petraeus was asked that and he said it\'s not a ramp.\xc2\xa0 And he said --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it may be a difference in -- no, no, no, I think -- I think, having been in these meetings, I think maybe the word "ramp" has tripped people up, because we talked about the deployment off- or on-ramps, which, again, I -- the ramp I think that General Jones was discussing -- I talked to General Petraeus about this on Air Force One both to and from the West Point speech.\xc2\xa0 I think the ramp that he\'s referring to, that we\'re all referring to is, from that July 2011 date that the President has made clear that there will be a transition, there is a ramp at that point where, based on the conditions on the round, will decide the pacing for the thinning of American forces.</p>\n<p>But, again, Ed, the President has been crystal clear on this.\xc2\xa0 That date of transition in July 2011.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one quick thing on Copenhagen.\xc2\xa0 One of the complaints Republicans have this morning and this afternoon about the EPA decision is that they want better investigation of this e-mail controversy.\xc2\xa0 And several senators wrote a letter -- others in the House, as well -- saying that they believe that the science is not sound and that this -- what is the President\'s reaction, what\'s your reaction to this e-mail controversy?\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\'s legitimate, raises legitimate concerns --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think everybody is clear on the science.\xc2\xa0 I think scientists are clear on the science.\xc2\xa0 I think many on Capitol Hill are clear on the science.\xc2\xa0 I think that this notion that there\'s some debate, minus Lester, on the science is kind of silly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing -- I\'m sorry -- on Max Baucus.\xc2\xa0 Melodee Hanes we know was one of three names Senator Baucus sent to the White House to be U.S. Attorney.\xc2\xa0 Did Jim Messina, who\'s very close to Senator Baucus, did he play any role for the White House?\xc2\xa0 Did he recuse himself from any of those discussions?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what Jim\'s involvement was on those discussions, but I think as the senator told the media over the weekend and as we told you and others that asked, Senator Baucus did not give us any information about those three names.\xc2\xa0 Nobody here was involved in that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Jim is very close to Max Baucus.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But, Ed, when I say nobody was involved in it, I don\'t mean "everybody but people that know Senator Baucus" -- I mean nobody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he didn\'t play any role in getting a Justice Department job for her either?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Those are obviously jobs that are based on who\'s best for the job.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 On the anniversary of Pearl Harbor, what is the President\'s attitude toward the Japanese wanting to relocate their bases?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we discussed a process whereby -- we discussed in Japan with the Japanese a process of going through those discussions with them.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more to add than what the President and the Prime Minister talked about in Japan a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then you don\'t have a position yet?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, there is a position because there\'s an agreement.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what both the sides reiterated.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My other question is, why didn\'t the President bring up the public option and abortion when he met with Congress yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President has throughout this process talked about the importance of getting it done; talked about ensuring that those that have insurance will see their costs go down; that we\'re serious about addressing the budgetary implications -- not just in paying for health care reform, but understanding that we\'re changing the direction of the cost curve and providing accessible and affordable insurance to those that don\'t have it.</p>\n<p>The President reiterated that message, the idea of continuing to work toward that goal in the Senate and get something out of the Senate and passed.\xc2\xa0 The President didn\'t get into individual amendments -- like he hasn\'t throughout this process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he care about these?\xc2\xa0 Are these too -- too difficult to overcome?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t believe so.\xc2\xa0 I think Leader Reid has appointed, in terms of the public option, Democrats on both sides of this issue to come get together and discuss the issue.\xc2\xa0 And by all accounts those discussions are going well and they are making progress.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On July 2011 -- first of all, I understand it was a date picked by the Pentagon, but, still, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think the reason people seem to be struggling with it and why so many people were talking about it on the shows yesterday is it just feels so arbitrary.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what if June 2011 turns out to be a better time, or August turns out to be a better time?\xc2\xa0 Will the President say, doggone it, I said July 2011 and that\'s it, we\'re not changing that date.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Without getting into your arbitrary hypothetical, again, I\'d point you to -- this wasn\'t arbitrarily picked by the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 This was a decision based on what the strategy that the President had settled on and what had to happen between now and whatever date in order to ramp up the training of the army and the police that comprised the national security force of Afghanistan, at a point in which they\'re capable of taking over that responsibility.\xc2\xa0 The Pentagon determined that that date was July 2011.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which could change if they do better than we think.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that would be a nice problem to have.\xc2\xa0 Understand that what happened --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it could change.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it could happen earlier, sure --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it won\'t happen later.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It won\'t happen later.\xc2\xa0 The President is quite clear on this.\xc2\xa0 Understand what happened between the meeting by which this date was originally discussed, what happened in the process moving forward was the ramp up of troops actually happened faster than the original chart that the Pentagon had.\xc2\xa0 So what that means is our forces, under the President\'s mission, will in fact get there faster, therefore be there longer in order to help accomplish the goals necessary for that thinning to take place.\xc2\xa0 That date starts in July of 2011.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What if the Pentagon comes to him and says, we\'re not going to be ready July 2011, is he going to say, too bad, that\'s the date I set.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are going to have assessments throughout this process that will measure us attaining the goals leading up to that point.\xc2\xa0 The President, though, Chip, has been clear:\xc2\xa0 The transition point begins on July 2011 because the Pentagon says that\'s the point in which the mission will be able to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s what they say now.\xc2\xa0 But if they change what they say is the point, then the President would change with them?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'re discussing what is being discussed now and I\'m telling you the President is clear on July 2011.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On TARP, any change from Friday?\xc2\xa0 And I was a little unclear on what the President was suggesting in his comments just now on using TARP money for a jobs bill.\xc2\xa0 Where does that stand right now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that this White House is looking at.\xc2\xa0 I think the -- I will repeat what the President said.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not getting ahead of what he\'s going to talk about tomorrow, but one of the things that the report that Jake made mention of is that if you compare the amount of money that the administration believed would be necessary as part of the Midsession Review and what we believe is necessary now, that difference is $341 to $141 billion, which is approximately -- obviously $200 billion; and that the White House is looking at whether or not using that for legislation to create an environment for increased hiring for jobs, whether that would be available.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that money wasn\'t really appropriated for --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that money was appropriated to stabilize the economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It wasn\'t appropriated for things like weatherization and the kind of thing that you had in the first stimulus.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are the kinds of -- money to states to keep them from laying off workers, tax breaks for small business, weatherization infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like exactly the kind of stuff that was in the stimulus.\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\'t it a little silly not to say this is a second stimulus?\xc2\xa0 And how can you use money from TARP to pay for a second stimulus without it turning into basically a slush fund, as Republicans say?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Republicans are just simply dead wrong.\xc2\xa0 I think you can look at any number of figures to denote that while they have continued to criticize the Recovery Act, we\'ve seen the first positive job growth in four economic quarters.\xc2\xa0 And we saw the best jobs report that we\'ve seen in 22 months, dating back to the dated beginning of the recession in December 2007.</p>\n<p>The President again, and the team, as well as members of Capitol Hill are looking at these questions to see what are the important and necessary next steps, some of which, but not all of which, the President will discuss tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you still saying this is not a second stimulus, but it\'s going to be?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not.\xc2\xa0 Even though many of the components are the same thing that was in the first stimulus?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question, just a straight, factual question.\xc2\xa0 The Chicago guy indicted on the Mumbai situation, do you know anything about that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 That\'s my job.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can factually say that indeed I do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what the latest is?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I would, for information relating to his indictment, obviously I would point you to the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, which handed down the indictment.</p>\n<p>Obviously, I continue to say, and the President does, too, that we have taken and will continue to take every step necessary to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 Today was an important day in doing that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on something, Robert.\xc2\xa0 The President just now actually, when he was asked about the use of TARP funds, he seemed to indicate that he believes there are parameters around what can be used.\xc2\xa0 He said that, you know, the initial reason to use the TARP funds was to unfreeze credit markets and that\'s one of the things that he\'d be looking to use that money for when it comes to trying to move credit for small businesses.\xc2\xa0 So I guess my question is does that mean he believes there are some parameters on what this money can be used for and what it can\'t be used for?\xc2\xa0 Do you guys believe the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, no final determinations have been made.\xc2\xa0 And when final determinations are and have been made then we\'ll discuss what those decisions are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this an interpretation of the law as it was passed? Is that what you guys are looking at?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what\'s the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the exact criteria of which they\'re going through each and every thing, except the top line of -- that they\'re looking through this.\xc2\xa0 And as we move forward we\'ll make that determination.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that will be clear tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Or could that be --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If it\'s clear tomorrow it will be.\xc2\xa0 If it\'s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but I mean, is it possible --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- if a determination isn\'t made then it won\'t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so he may roll out some things, but leave it up to Congress to decide whether TARP money can be used?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would describe tomorrow as not the totality of all the President\'s ideas.\xc2\xa0 The President will discuss a few ideas that he has heard in his discussions with CEOs and small businesses.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously one of the things the President talked about today was that even as things are getting better for larger banks that there are many, many small businesses throughout the country that still have a lot of problems in getting access to the type of credit that they were normally getting before the economic -- the great economic downturn.</p>\n<p>We are looking at ways that would help small businesses get that credit, find access to that capital, and the President will discuss other ways that he believes the government can assist the private sector in an atmosphere that leads to additional hiring of jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a Cash for Clunkers-style program that has to do with weatherization that was sort of one --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I won\'t get ahead of where the President is on that tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick December deadline questions on the international front.\xc2\xa0 START -- anything new this week?\xc2\xa0 Can we expect anything this week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, the two sides continue to take part in negotiations, and we believe that we can get something done soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Soon this week, or soon, you\'re not ready to commit --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you rule this week out as a week that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not if they get it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Look, I mean -- you know what I mean.\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, we\'re going to be in Europe, that\'s why we have -- that\'s why I ask.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t -- I don\'t expect any European vacations, how about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Iran front.\xc2\xa0 Where do things stand with pushing on the sanctions?\xc2\xa0 And then the second question is, there\'s been some confusion about whether -- is Iran a supportive actor of what we\'re doing in Afghanistan or are they part of the problem?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how much do you believe they\'re playing a role in the insurgency in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some guidance from the NSC on the second part.\xc2\xa0 On the first part, Chuck, the President will -- continues to actively work with our partners in the P5-plus-1 in order to -- in order to continue to ask the Iranians to live up to their obligations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are those negotiations still active?\xc2\xa0 That hasn\'t been shut down, sort of -- has it moved to the U.N.?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But again, that\'s -- it\'s not up to the P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not up to us.\xc2\xa0 It\'s up to the Iranians, right.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve got a certain set of obligations that they\'ve always had.\xc2\xa0 Those obligations can be met at any time by the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 Failure to meet those obligations, as the President and others have said, will result in next steps.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have they failed -- I guess -- I\'ve heard this failure -- have they failed to meet these?\xc2\xa0 Have you guys determined --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As of right now, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right now they have failed and therefore you\'re moving on to step -- plan B?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think we\'ve talked largely about the fact that time is running out, that that -- hold on, hold on -- that the sand in the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is going to run out.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, running.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The sand in the hourglass is running out.\xc2\xa0 As of this moment -- minus anything that these guys tell me has happened since I\'ve been up here -- have they failed to meet their obligations?\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve failed to meet their obligations --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And therefore you go to plan B?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we would move to next steps.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you haven\'t yet.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not yet.</p>\n<p>Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last week the President obviously held a jobs summit here.\xc2\xa0 He invited business leaders, union leaders to come and talk about jobs ideas.\xc2\xa0 Today the EPA promulgated its -- had its finding on greenhouse gases, and the Department of Labor also unveiled -- promulgated a bunch of new workplace regulations.\xc2\xa0 Do you see -- does the White House see a potential short-term jobs cost to energy, environmental and --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, there\'s a short -- there\'s a short-, medium- and long-term benefit to establishing our nation as the clean energy leader of the world.\xc2\xa0 Somebody is going to build millions of solar panels.\xc2\xa0 Somebody is going to build wind towers and wind turbines and create the power that\'s going to light our homes and heat our homes and cool our homes for decades to come.\xc2\xa0 The question is, which country is that going to be?</p>\n<p>The President, through the Recovery Act, incentivized the building of those implements that I just discussed in a way that had not previously been incentivized.\xc2\xa0 I think the President wants to see us create that type of clean energy economy through comprehensive legislation that would establish us as the leader in the world.\xc2\xa0 That will create -- it\'s created jobs all over this country and it has the ability to create far, far more.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he believe that a cap-and-trade system, like the one that passed the House, like the one that he would like to see pass the Senate, is a better instrument to do what you\'re talking about than a regulatory approach like EPA --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President\'s belief is that the preferred method is through legislation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President would tell you if he were standing here today.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President and I have said going back probably since the beginning of this administration.\xc2\xa0 Again, Massachusetts v. EPA was not something that was decided sometime last week and the process was started.\xc2\xa0 This was decided back in 2007 and the clock, in a sense, has been ticking since that time period.</p>\n<p>But, again, if we incentivize, through comprehensive clean energy legislation, an economy that puts a premium on alternative energy like wind and solar, we\'re going to create a lot of jobs -- in the short term, in the medium term, and ultimately in the long term.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Real quickly on TARP, does the President believe that a jobs bill funded in part out of savings from unexpectedly smaller TARP payments -- does he believe that that\'s revenue neutral, that it does not cost the taxpayer money?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it goes to the same pot of money that ultimately would have been used for something else.</p>\n<p>Did you have a follow on energy?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you know that the -- regulations like that will create more jobs than they might cost?\xc2\xa0 You\'re regulating industries across the country, but you\'re talking about one sector that you want to grow -- the green sector.\xc2\xa0 How do you know it will create more jobs than lose them?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because how are you -- if you can\'t -- if you\'re finding incentives in other ways to produce power, for instance, that\'s less polluting, then you\'re going to do that through solar and wind.\xc2\xa0 I forget the number now -- the number of electric car factories in this country at the beginning of the year I think was none and I think we\'re somewhere either between three or four.\xc2\xa0 The largest pollutant emitter of greenhouse gases -- the largest sector of that is used in transportation.\xc2\xa0 We can create jobs by meeting the requirements of clean energy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that you will create jobs, but what I\'m asking is how do you know you will create more jobs than you will lose by putting these restrictions on all industries across the country?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or is there a study or have you studied that at the White House?\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure there are tons of studies that do indeed say that, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know of any?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We can get you some, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to the Copenhagen meeting and the timing of these announcement by the EPA today, first of all, did the President have to sign off on this himself or was it approved at some other level here?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check.\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, we\'ve stated throughout the campaign and through our time here that science isn\'t going to get -- science won\'t be vetoed in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 Science is up to the scientists.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And you said that the timing is based on the first step being completed, and you pointed to the Supreme Court action on this that required this endangerment finding.\xc2\xa0 So you\'re telling us that it was just a coincidence then that it happened today, a week --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m telling you this is part of a process that started more than two years ago with the Supreme Court finding that the EPA should regulate greenhouse gases that threaten the public health because it\'s a pollutant.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it all came down, just coincidentally, a week before he\'s going to Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the stimulus plan is to save or create 3.5 million jobs by the end of next year in this new environment to foster job growth that the President will discuss tomorrow, how many additional jobs does he want to see saved or created?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get ahead of what the President will talk about tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But whether he talks about it or not, how many jobs would the President like to see added on top of the stimulus spending next year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, understand that we\'re seven and a half, I think, seven and a half million jobs below what the employment level was in December 2007, which was the last unemployment report released by the Department of Labor that showed positive job growth.</p>\n<p>We\'ve got quite some way to go, but understand, Julianna, the President is not going to unveil the silver bullet idea, which adds all the jobs that are -- all the jobs that will be made up by the loss in the economic downturn and then some.\xc2\xa0 This is -- if there was one idea to do this, I assume it would have been done sometime in the intervening 22 months, that, by which we haven\'t seen a jobs report that showed positive job growth.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he like to see new measures add to that 3.5 million number?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and also, back to the TARP funds, some Democrats are talking about using as much as $70 billion from the unspent TARP funds to go toward new jobs for infrastructure and whatnot.\xc2\xa0 Is that a figure that the President is comfortable with?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, when there\'s a decision on that made here, we\'ll let you guys know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so hypothetically speaking --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll refer you to my Chip Reid hypothetical answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if TARP funds were used to go towards measures to create jobs, what message does that send to Main Street?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What message does that send to Main Street?\xc2\xa0 Help is on the way.\xc2\xa0 It sends the message that your economic vitality is just as important as anybody that lives or works or breathes on Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the message the President has hoped and wanted to send for his entire administration, and that\'s what he\'s done in the recovery plan; that\'s what he\'ll continue to do tomorrow in his speech.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you just answer a hypothetical?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, she said, "what would that mean," and that\'s easy -- that\'s both knowable and announceable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if it\'s knowable it can\'t be a hypothetical.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, if it\'s knowable, then it\'s not hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She actually started the question with the word, "hypothetically."</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I largely dispensed with that clause.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of quick ones.\xc2\xa0 Robert, when the announcement was made on the Nobel Peace Prize, the White House said the President would devote that money to charity.\xc2\xa0 Has a charity been determined yet?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A series of charities are being looked at, but we haven\'t made any final decisions yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Has the administration decided whether or not it is permissible under the existing TARP law to use these funds?\xc2\xa0 Republicans argue that it\'s not; that the funds that are unobligated should go to debt reduction only.\xc2\xa0 Has a determination been made there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not whether you will or not, but whether you can.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, no decisions have been made, and once those decisions are made we\'ll enunciate those unhypothetical decisions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess what I\'m trying to get at is not whether a decision has been made but whether you\'ve determined whether or not you can even make that decision.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any guidance other than the fact that the decision hasn\'t been made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Picking up on what Admiral Mullen said today, he referenced when he was talking to the Marines at Camp Lejeune about July 2011, he said "There is no exit strategy associated with that."\xc2\xa0 That\'s a direct quote.\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate, and does that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to look through --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s exactly what he said.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what the context of the surrounding --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand, I\'m sure that\'s -- I\'m sure he said more than that at Camp Lejeune.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a nice flight to get there.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure he had more than six words to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I know.\xc2\xa0 He said, I know you Marines are interested in the 2011 July deadline, and I want to tell you, there is no deadline, which is what Ed asked about.\xc2\xa0 Right after that, the very next phrase:\xc2\xa0 "There is no exit strategy associated with that."\xc2\xa0 That\'s a direct quote.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what he meant.\xc2\xa0 I can simply -- I can simply, again, reiterate what I did at many points last week and in discussions with the President this week:\xc2\xa0 July 2011 is the transition date, the date --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The date when forces begin to come out.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- the date by which our forces will be thinned and responsibility for Afghan security will be the responsibility of the Afghans.\xc2\xa0 Now, again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you define "thinned"?\xc2\xa0 What does that mean?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, what I\'ve said and what the President has said --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that we will begin, based on conditions on the ground, to make decisions about the pacing for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not whether it begins.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there have -- not whether it begins.\xc2\xa0 That has been determined.</p>\n<p>Look, there were erroneous reports the day of the speech that somehow the President was going to say everybody involved would be out of Afghanistan in three years.\xc2\xa0 That wasn\'t true then and it\'s not true now.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\'t envision, like is happening -- similar to what\'s happening in Iraq, where there\'s a drawdown based on what General Odierno says are conditions on the ground.\xc2\xa0 The same will take place in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 There\'s not going to be some drop off of a cliff.</p>\n<p>But, again -- and I think, quite frankly, look exactly at what was said yesterday by Secretary Gates.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the date in which the transition will begin.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t be any clearer than that; the President can\'t; I doubt Secretary Gates could.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to run something that Joe Barton, a Republican, said today about the EPA decision and about the climate e-mails.\xc2\xa0 "When the scientists whose work is the bedrock for our global warming policy use words like \'travesty\' and \'trick\' to describe their actions, it\'s time to slow down and consider what we\'re doing, not sound the charge.\xc2\xa0 Good sense got run over today when the EPA hit the gas instead of tapping the brakes."</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not entirely sure what all that meant, but -- no offense, but I -- that seemed --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, they\'re saying that the climate e-mails --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It seemed to hit the rhetorical gas rather than sort of tap on the brake.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- again, it\'s hard for me to discern what all that meant, except to say --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the folks (inaudible) have set down.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. has begun its own investigation into this.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But none of those things should slow the momentum in any way, shape, or form?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It shouldn\'t because the science is clear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And settled?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And settled.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is Friday\'s surprisingly strong jobs report factoring into the President\'s thoughts about a jobs bill?\xc2\xa0 Is it making him sort of limit what he --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The truth is obviously that was better news than we have seen, understanding that the report still mentioned that we lost 11,000 jobs in the previous month, adding on to the already large jobs losses.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it changed in any way the President\'s viewpoint on decisions that he will -- in the speech that he\'ll make tomorrow, largely because the depth of our downturn -- I should just have the chart loaded up -- but just the sheer depth of the trough in terms of job loss from -- dating back to the beginning of the recession far exceeds anything that we\'ve seen in recent recessions.\xc2\xa0 We have to do, and the President and his team have talked about doing everything that is possible and responsible to fill that trough in, and that\'s what the President will talk about tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he see things on the -- being on the right trajectory now, even absent his --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say, yes, the President does believe things are on the right trajectory.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen -- before you can have positive job growth, you have to have positive economic growth, and we saw that last quarter.\xc2\xa0 This report continues moving in the right direction a trend -- again, the first jobs report I think we got when we were here was January\'s jobs figures, which showed 741,000 jobs had been lost in that month.\xc2\xa0 Last month showed 11,000 jobs.</p>\n<p>Now, the President would continue to be cautious in understanding that there will no doubt be bumps along the way, and we just should keep in mind that that\'s going to happen and the President will do all that he can to continue to force that trajectory in the direction of which it\'s going.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As health care moves forward, if the Senate decides to work up until the 24th and if the Senate decides to work the week after Christmas, will the President adjust his Hawaii trip schedule?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to him about -- I mean, obviously he can -- they can -- we can all do our jobs wherever we need to do our jobs.\xc2\xa0 I would say that if the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That sounds like no.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- if the President can be helpful, the President will be helpful.\xc2\xa0 It\'s getting into that Hawaii hypothetical.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the Senate is in session the week after Christmas, which is a possibility, why would he not want to rethink being here?\xc2\xa0 And wouldn\'t it be awkward for him to be on vacation -- or not, is he not needed in the process?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he\'s needed in the process.\xc2\xa0 I think he went up and was part of the process.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- when the Senate makes some scheduling decisions, we\'d be happy to look at them.\xc2\xa0 Jeff, I daresay the President can do his job wherever he is.\xc2\xa0 They invented phones -- they\'re wonderful.\xc2\xa0 There\'s secure video teleconferencing if anything needs to happen.\xc2\xa0 And the President can conduct his business -- like he will do in Oslo just this week.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President is not going to cancel his trip to Norway or Copenhagen because the Senate is in session.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the same as vacation though, if I can just ask one more?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that the same as being on vacation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, I think if you ask the President whether he is ever really on vacation, and I think if you asked any President whether they were ever really on vacation, one call, one report, one piece of information I can assure -- I can assure you, can change all of that in a heartbeat.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain the purpose of the meeting with Al Gore?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just to talk through the upcoming trip to Copenhagen and his thoughts on that.\xc2\xa0 This will -- we\'ll have more information today, or later today, on a similar meeting with business executives and CEOs that are supportive of comprehensive climate change -- a comprehensive climate change agreement as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What happens to the 2011 July date if President Karzai\'s government simply proves unable to address corruption and they\'re just unable to train a significant number of soldiers in time?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, suffice to say we won\xe2\x80\x99t figure that out in June of 2011, that and I think the President addressed a series of steps that would be taken at both that level and underneath the national government level as to how to address the delivery of basic services without corruption.\xc2\xa0 There will be a month-by-month assessment on -- on our training.\xc2\xa0 This isn\'t going to be a surprise.</p>\n<p>But what\'s important is we create an incentive with the government to take the actions that are ultimately necessary to improve their own security situation.\xc2\xa0 The President believed that was important.\xc2\xa0 Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff thought providing those incentives were important.\xc2\xa0 The Pentagon came up with that as a day -- as a date, and the policy and the strategy fit all of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the Afghans want to do it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve said that.\xc2\xa0 The proof is in the pudding.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll hold them to that, and take whatever steps are necessary to meet those goals if they\'re unable or unwilling to do so.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a bunch of Democratic candidates are running against the President\'s surge in Afghanistan -- the top four contenders in tomorrow\'s Massachusetts Senate primaries, the top two candidates in the Ohio Senate race, several other House candidates.\xc2\xa0 Will this deep opposition among Democrats on the campaign trail harm your hopes for -- your chances for success on Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, I think the President would be the first to tell you that people can look at the situation and come to different conclusions on both the Democratic and Republican side.\xc2\xa0 I think that was, in some ways, obviously true for Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The President put forward a plan and a strategy and a mission that he believed was narrow enough to succeed, coupled it with the resources that he believed were necessary to have it succeed.\xc2\xa0 And now it is up to the commanders on the ground and others to implement the strategy the President laid out.</p>\n<p>I think you all know from the guidance, later on this afternoon the President will see in the Oval Office Ambassador Eikenberry, General McChrystal ahead of their testimony later this week.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President will reiterate with them what he\'s told the American people, and quite frankly, what he told them on the secure video teleconferencing that all of what has to go in to, and all of what is necessary to make this plan succeed.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ve heard from General McChrystal and Ambassador Eikenberry that they believe that this is both the right strategy and has the resources to succeed.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, people can come to different conclusions, but the President made his decision based on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what if the Taliban knows those resources?\xc2\xa0 Last week, I believe you said the administration hasn\'t made a decision yet regarding a supplemental.\xc2\xa0 Can you just talk about what are some of the issues involved in making that decision?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what they\'re trying to figure out now is the degree to which they\'re -- obviously, a lot of issues that will go into account as we create -- put together a budget.\xc2\xa0 We determined the length and ability of money that\'s there now to fund operations in the theater.\xc2\xa0 And I think the most important point that the President said in his speech in West Point, that we cannot -- we cannot -- we\'re unable to walk away from the human cost as well as the cost to our Treasury.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s -- I think -- the President said we have to said we have to take this into account; we\'re going to have to take this into our budgetary account, which is something that hadn\'t previously been done for a while.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, since Fed Chairman Bernanke testified last week at his confirmation hearing, there are more and more Democrats who seem to be concerned or offended by some of the comments he made suggesting that Medicare and Social Security might need some tinkering.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any concern that there is this kind of pressure from within the party?\xc2\xa0 Does the President stand by his nomination?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President obviously stands by his nomination.\xc2\xa0 I, truthfully, Ken, have not seen the comments on those issues that he made, but the President has -- the President nominated him for a reason and believed he\'d be the best person to serve going forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\'s policy on privatizing Social Security or privatizing a part of Social Security?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President obviously, I think, stated his opposition to plans to do that in 2005 and 2006.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I know you can\'t get into specifics for security reasons, but does the President plan to go to Afghanistan personally anytime soon?\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us sort of, by the end of the year, or in the first quarter of next year?\xc2\xa0 And what would be the value -- does he think it\'s important, in the process of executing this new strategy, to be there in person?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, look, the President, as you know, visited in I don\'t remember which month it was, June or July of 2008 -- I\'m not going to get into future scheduling decisions about something like that.\xc2\xa0 I think the President obviously would love to honor the commitment, the sacrifice and the service of all those that serve in Afghanistan, that serve in Iraq, and serve around the world, without getting into some specific scheduling decisions.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Has the President called President-elect Lobo in Honduras in the same way that he\'s called other leaders after they were elected?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We can check.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does he plan to send a representative to his inauguration in January?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can -- I don\'t know the answers, but we can certainly check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, I\'m going to go to April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Neither of them are on global warming -- alleged global warming.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You caught yourself.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\'re going to get kicked out of the secret club, Lester.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Come back to me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to go April, then I\'ll go Lester, and then I\'ll seek refuge.</p>\n<p>Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on jobs and black America, President Obama made some comments to some reporters recently.\xc2\xa0 He said, "I think it\'s a mistake to start thinking in terms of particular ethnic segments of the United States rather than to think we are all in this together and we\'re all going to get out of this together."\xc2\xa0 The Kirwan Institute says that when you have certain groups that are unique, having unemployment rates maybe double that or close to double that of mainstream America, you have to deal with unique approaches.\xc2\xa0 What say you and this administration about that, even as the President is saying that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\'t think there\'s any doubt that what the President will do is seek -- I think if you go and look through -- and I did not do this for the most recent figures -- but the economic team has, on certain different months, provided me -- broken out by high school and college education, I think one of the things you see in this recession is that unlike previous recessions, this has -- the joblessness has affected a huge swath of the American public.\xc2\xa0 I think what the President will do and what he has done is look for ways, understanding, as I said earlier, there\'s not a silver bullet.\xc2\xa0 There\'s not one solution that will lift everybody.\xc2\xa0 It is, how do we create jobs in -- and bring manufacturing back by that investment in clean energy?\xc2\xa0 How do we lay a foundation for our future economic growth with education so that people can go to college and get the skills that they need for the jobs of the future?</p>\n<p>I think what the President is saying is that we have -- we are facing such a large problem that we need to do everything in our power to make it better, and I think that\'s what he\'s -- that\'s what he\'s done as part of the Recovery Act, and ultimately as part of the jobs --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Congressional Black Caucus has come out strongly about his comments about this universal approach.\xc2\xa0 Is this White House talking with the CBC?\xc2\xa0 Because they have -- they\'re more grassroots in the communities to find out what people are saying.\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, you know, obviously the chief of staff and others were up talking to the CBC last week.\xc2\xa0 One message I think everyone would have is part of getting our economy back in order is getting financial reform moved through Congress.\xc2\xa0 Whether it\'s establishing that resolution authority that I talked about earlier that allows us to take something like an AIG, break it apart, and deal with what threatens our economy versus haphazard risk-taking -- that\'s part of financial reform; as is a consumer financial administration that would protect anybody from skyrocketing credit card rates, loans that are -- teaser rates that are used to attract people for loans that ultimately don\'t have the wherewithal to pay.\xc2\xa0 I think the first step in that is ensuring that that legislation moves forward, and I think the White House hopes that all of Congress will come together to support and move that forward.</p>\n<p>Lester.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Senator Mark Warner is supporting Virginia\'s 90-year-old Colonel Van Barfoot, who\'s a Medal of Honor recipient, whose homeowner\'s association near Richmond has threatened to sue him if he fails to remove the flagpole on which each morning he raises the U.S. flag.\xc2\xa0 And my question, the President joins Senator Warner in support Colonel Barfoot, doesn\'t he?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t talked to the President specifically about this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously I\'ve heard about this through news accounts.\xc2\xa0 I think the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You would presume the President supports him, wouldn\'t you?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'d like to presume to finish my answer.\xc2\xa0 The President believes, and I think all of us believe, that the very least we can do is show our gratitude and thanks to somebody that served our country so admirably.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s silly to think that somebody that\'s done that can\'t have a flagpole and show the proper respect and appreciation that any flag deserves by flying that in their neighborhood.</p>\n<p>I dare say that we\'ve all had run-ins with neighborhood associations that somehow have forgotten what it means -- whether it\'s to display -- I got into an argument about displaying -- in fact, it might have been for Mark Warner for governor -- in my yard a sign when I lived in a townhouse.\xc2\xa0 And I have had the same thing happen to me in flying a flag that I got that flew over the Capitol.\xc2\xa0 I think the notion that you can\'t do that is kind of silly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s an excellent answer and I have one other.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I should probably leave then with that, shouldn\'t I, Lester?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 To The Point News reported that President Obama is the first President to refuse to address the Gridiron Club since Grover Cleveland.\xc2\xa0 And if that is accurate, why did he refuse?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the history of this.\xc2\xa0 I know that the President addressed the Gridiron Club before the President was President, and before the President was a senator.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he didn\'t this time.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 See, I knew I should have left, right, Lester?\xc2\xa0 I think the President has -- look, I don\'t know what you got against Sarah Palin.\xc2\xa0 I thought she was quite funny.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything against --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:59 P.M. EST</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
