Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:39 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 I hope you had a terrific weekend, and I welcome you here back at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Before I take your questions, I wanted to highlight something that\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the House of Representatives, where instead of ensuring that our bills are paid and obligations met and that we do not default, and instead of helping achieve opportunity for all Americans by extending emergency unemployment insurance or by raising the minimum wage, creating new jobs and promoting growth, this week, House Republicans are trying to move a bill that would weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and hurt consumers who finally have a watchdog looking out for them.</p>\n<p>THE CFPB\xe2\x80\x99s sole mission is to protect consumers from the abuses of the past and to help people not get cheated on their finances, on their credit cards, on their student loans, and on their car loans.\xc2\xa0 Since its creation, the CFPB has put in place safer national mortgage standards to protect borrowers; begun to implement protections governing non-mortgage products; improved disclosure requirements so that consumers are better informed; created a national consumer complaint center that has handled nearly 270,000 consumer complaints to date; secured more than $3 billion in relief for nearly 10 million consumers through enforcement actions against bad actors who violated the law; and established federal oversight of important financial industries for the first time, including non-bank mortgage lenders, payday lenders, debt collectors, and credit-reporting agencies.</p>\n<p>Now, what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in the House is part of an ongoing tired and partisan Republican agenda to unwind the protections that were put in place to protect our economy and consumers from another economic crisis.\xc2\xa0 And of course, if the President were to see this bill come to his desk, he would veto it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We should be working together to continue the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 Right now, we could be working together to help create more good manufacturing jobs.\xc2\xa0 We could be working together to help our economy by passing patent reform, by passing housing finance reform \xe2\x80\x93- not by engaging in the same old tired debates that do nothing to build on that progress.\xc2\xa0 The CFPB was and is an extremely important piece of the Wall Street reform agenda the President pressed hard for against some very powerful vested interests, and it is vital that Republicans in Congress keep in mind the consumers out there who need what the CFPB provides, which is protection.</p>\n<p>With that, I take your questions.</p>\n<p>Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A couple different topics.\xc2\xa0 U.S. officials have told the AP that the administration is at least considering using a drone strike to take out an American al Qaeda operative overseas.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been involved in these discussions?\xc2\xa0 And what would the legal rationale for taking that action be?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, as you know, I would not comment on something like that -- an alleged specific operation.\xc2\xa0 And I would not discuss particular targets that may or may not be under consideration.\xc2\xa0 I would, of course, be able to point you to what the President said about the issue of the government taking lethal action against an American citizen in his speech in May of 2013 at NDU.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In that speech, he said that he does not believe it would be constitutional for the government to target and kill any U.S. citizen without due process, nor should any President deploy armed drones over U.S. soil.\xc2\xa0 But he also said that when a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against the United States, and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens, and when neither the United States nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot, his citizenship should not serve as a shield.</p>\n<p>But beyond that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on alleged specific plans or operations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether he has been involved in the discussions?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that would be commenting on an alleged specific plan or operation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a separate topic, Michael Sam, who is an all-American college football player, announced over the weekend that he\xe2\x80\x99s gay.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady and the Vice President I think have both commented on Twitter.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any response?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have nothing specifically from the President at this time except to say that he shares the sentiments expressed by the First Lady and the Vice President and so many others in marveling at his courage and congratulating him on the decision he made, on the support he\xe2\x80\x99s had from his team, and wishing him well in the future, including in professional football.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of discussion that this could affect his standing in the NFL draft, which is coming up in the next couple of months.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to the President about this, but do you know if he would think that this announcement should affect his standing in the draft and how NFL teams might look at him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, without having this be a reflection of a conversation with the President, I can tell you that in general that it is his view that it should not have an effect.\xc2\xa0 I mean, any athlete\xe2\x80\x99s abilities should be measured by what -- in the traditional way, in terms of how he or she performs in the sport and on the field, in this case.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, his performance has been exceptional.\xc2\xa0 So I think that would be the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans are meeting to talk about how to proceed on the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 Apparently one of the plans is to link raising the debt ceiling to restoration of retired military personnel benefits that were cut.\xc2\xa0 How does the President feel about that?\xc2\xa0 Would he sign such an increase?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our position on the responsibility of Congress to ensure that our debts are paid, that the bills that Congress racked up are paid has not changed.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to pay a ransom of any kind in return for Congress doing its job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ll take Republican leaders at their word when they say that they won\'t let the United States default, and they will not play the kind of brinksmanship that led to a shutdown last fall and to doubts about whether or not we might default.\xc2\xa0 That did great harm to the economy, to the middle class, and to the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that Republicans will be true to their word here and simply take care of their business, do the right thing and ensure that that ceiling is lifted.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does that mean that he would not sign a bill --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re speculating -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a \xe2\x80\x9cwhat if this were the bill or that were the bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Our position has not changed.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed for a long, long time.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not negotiating over Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to pay its bills.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On immigration, Senator Schumer said over the weekend, or suggested that perhaps one way to get the bill done would be to put off the affected implementation date of any immigration reform until after the 2016 election.\xc2\xa0 Would that be acceptable to the President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve put out our principles.\xc2\xa0 The President has strongly supported a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate that reflects those principles.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re now at a stage of waiting to see what the House can produce.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s been significant progress.\xc2\xa0 Amid a lot of other discussion and debate, the fact is House Republicans and House Republican leaders have made progress on this issue.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward standards and principles of their own, and those principles contrast pretty significantly with the de facto position held by Republicans as recently of last year, which was self-deportation.</p>\n<p>So we will wait to see what the House produces.\xc2\xa0 The need for comprehensive immigration reform is stronger every day.\xc2\xa0 The benefit that it would provide to our economy, to our middle class, to the security of our borders, and to our capacity to be a magnet for innovative entrepreneurs is as great today -- and greater today -- as it has ever been.</p>\n<p>So we believe the consensus here is significant and growing that the House will act and do the right thing, not because the President says it should, but because so many voices out there are joined in unison calling on Congress to act.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that the American people want and agree on when it comes to Washington it\xe2\x80\x99s action as opposed to obstruction or inertia.\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for a bipartisan effort that by every outside economic analysis would do enormous good to our economy, for our middle class and for our businesses, as well as our security.\xc2\xa0 So there are solid reasons for Republicans as well as Democrats to move forward on this, and we look forward to that happening.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could ask one last question on Cuba.\xc2\xa0 The European Union has apparently agreed to launch negotiations with Cuba to increase trade, investment, and dialogue on human rights.\xc2\xa0 How does the United States feel about this warming of ties?\xc2\xa0 Has the United States consulted with the E.U., or vice versa, on this matter?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that report.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>Move around -- yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I have a few questions.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any schedule to visit South Korea on his upcoming trip to Asia in April?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling announcements to make today beyond those that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already made for upcoming travel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more question.\xc2\xa0 Last week at the National Prayer Breakfast, President Obama mentioned about that he was working on the release of Kenneth Bae from North Korea.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any specific plan to do?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that we are deeply disappointed by the DPRK decision for a second time to rescind its invitation for Ambassador King to travel to Pyongyang to discuss Kenneth Bae\xe2\x80\x99s release.\xc2\xa0 The DPRK announced publicly in May of 2013 that it would not use the fate of Kenneth Bae as a political bargaining chip.\xc2\xa0 We remind the DPRK that the U.S.-ROK military exercises are transparent, regularly scheduled and defense-oriented.\xc2\xa0 These exercises are in no way linked to Mr. Bae\xe2\x80\x99s case, and we believe they know that.</p>\n<p>We, again, call on the DPRK to grant Mr. Bae special amnesty and immediate release as a humanitarian gesture so that he may reunite with his family and seek medical care.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to work actively to secure Mr. Bae\xe2\x80\x99s release.\xc2\xa0 Per our longstanding offer, we remain prepared to send Ambassador King to North Korea in support of that effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, North Korean government announced that they cancelled the Robert King visit to North Korea.\xc2\xa0 How did you respond to that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I just said that we are deeply disappointed by that decision and would point to what the DPRK said in May of 2013 that it would not use the fate of Kenneth Bae as a political bargaining chip.\xc2\xa0 And we are very disappointed by the cancellation of the invitation to Ambassador King on this issue and we stand ready per our longstanding offer to dispatch Ambassador King to North Korea to help secure Kenneth Bae\xe2\x80\x99s release.</p>\n<p>Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Following on Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question on the drones, the President clearly feels very deeply about the drone policy.\xc2\xa0 Is this the kind of decision that would need to rise to the level of his desk?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the effort to ask the same question about a specific particular alleged reported action, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be able to discuss that kind of activity.\xc2\xa0 I can point you to what the President said and I think he spoke quite forthrightly about these issues in May of 2013 at NDU.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the University of Arkansas, archives have opened up records of a good friend, close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93- Diane Blair.\xc2\xa0 And it talks a lot about her personal notes, considerable notes about her discussions and friendship with them, and what they said during the times they were in the White House.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed that with the President, some of the interesting comments.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I have not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at the time that those documents \xe2\x80\x93- the information was not accessible was during the 2008 campaign.\xc2\xa0 And Senator Obama held Hillary Clinton to account, saying that the very time she was using those records as a basis to demonstrate her own experience for office that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t accessible, and he said, and \xe2\x80\x9cI think, Hillary, that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a different perspective now that perhaps now that he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office that private records and rememberances for a political figure, especially a candidate, ought to be kept private?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a long windup to a question I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I understand.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying, does the President have a view on Diane Blair\xe2\x80\x99s personal reminiscences?\xc2\xa0 I have not discussed that with him or how it would apply to him.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that I would point you to what he\xe2\x80\x99s said in the past.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you seen the information that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not, no.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about the AP story on an operational basis or even to confirm it.\xc2\xa0 But is there a protocol established since the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech that establishes a due process review within the various agencies involved \xe2\x80\x93- Defense, CIA, the White House, NSC \xe2\x80\x93- on cases like this where there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing war on terrorism or effort to deal with a potential terrorist threat that does involve an American? And how does that process \xe2\x80\x93- can you give us any idea about how that process works and how it changed after the marker the President laid down in that National Defense University speech?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can tell you is the President laid out in pretty explicit detail his approach to these issues at that speech.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the targeting of any American raises constitutional issues that are not present in other strikes.\xc2\xa0 But the high threshold that we have set for taking lethal action applies to all potential terrorist targets, regardless of whether or not they are American citizens.</p>\n<p>And I would remind you that we take extraordinary care to make sure that our counterterrorism actions are in accordance with all applicable domestic and international law, and that they are consistent with U.S. values and policy.\xc2\xa0 Of particular note, before we take any counterterrorism strike outside areas of active hostilities there must be near certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured -- the highest standard we can set.</p>\n<p>So, again, I can\'t talk about specific alleged or possible operations.\xc2\xa0 I can point you to what the President said in, I think, fairly deep granularity back in May of 2013 about the approach he takes and the administration takes and the changes that he\xe2\x80\x99s made in policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On immigration, I want to give you a chance to respond to something that is becoming a bit more thematic for Republicans in the House as they approach this issue and as they deal with their own internal divisions about it, this question of trust.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker said on Friday that, if the President uses executive orders that could be a deterrent for House Republicans to press forward in the sense that this administration to the minds of House Republicans enforces law in a bit of an arbitrary fashion. I want you to address that, take that head on, and respond to that in the context not of how this administration views its actions, but whether or not it should be linked in any way to this immigration debate.\xc2\xa0 And does it pressurize the President to change behavior?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major, I appreciate the question and I am glad to answer it.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the struggles the Republican Party has with this issue have nothing to do with the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is a tough issue for Republicans, as Republicans themselves acknowledge on the record all the time.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly -- those troubles -- I don\'t think it stands up to scrutiny to suggest that the troubles Republicans have on this issue are the President\xe2\x80\x99s fault, nor could they be attributed to a lack of trust.\xc2\xa0 After all, when comprehensive immigration reform came up as an issue in 2006, when President George W. Bush was in office, Republicans killed it because of their internal divisions.\xc2\xa0 Do you know how we know that?\xc2\xa0 Because John Boehner said so on the record.</p>\n<p>So, again, we understand and are even sympathetic to the fact that this is a tough issue for Republicans.\xc2\xa0 But nobody buys that Republican reluctance to deal with and pass comprehensive immigration reform has to do with the issues that you lay out.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case in 2006; it\xe2\x80\x99s not the case now.</p>\n<p>The reason -- we need to get this done legislatively in a bipartisan way because of all the benefits that passing comprehensive immigration reform would provide to our economy, to our border security and to our businesses.\xc2\xa0 And as I said earlier, we\xe2\x80\x99re confident this is going to happen.\xc2\xa0 We remain optimistic that 2014 is the year that it will happen, but not because I\xe2\x80\x99m saying it should happen or the President says it should happen, but because there are so many voices in this coalition and in this consensus that are making clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do, and including voices that not just Democrats but Republicans tend to listen to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what does it tell this White House when Charles Schumer, who is an ally of this White House, who works very hard on this issue, has had negotiations with House Republicans behind the scenes, wants to get this done, suggests a way to take open this pressure valve would be not to implement some of it until after this President has left office?\xc2\xa0 What does that tell you?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speak for any individual lawmaker.\xc2\xa0 I think that the issue itself --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that say that a Democrat who wants this to happen sees this as a problem also?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that that discussion highlights the fact that that excuse is bogus and that the issues here have to do with longstanding tension within the Republican Party about the need for immigration reform -- tensions that predate this President\xe2\x80\x99s arrival in office by quite some time.</p>\n<p>Brianna.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On the debt ceiling, if House Republicans were to wrap the increase in with some other measures that both Democrats and Republicans are amenable to, is there really a problem with that from the White House\xe2\x80\x99s perspective?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a whole bunch of \xe2\x80\x9cifs.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Our position has not changed --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that an issue, though, if it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of squished together with things that the White House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t oppose?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would suggest that you look at previous instances that the debt ceiling has been raised where there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been brinksmanship or the threat of default, and note that Republicans were able to do it in the past and they should be able to do it this time.\xc2\xa0 Republican leaders have said they will do it.</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about how that process works except to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to pay ransom on behalf of the American people to Republicans in Congress so that Republicans in Congress fulfill their constitutional responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 This one is easy because our position is clear and it has not and will not change.\xc2\xa0 And it is simply not necessarily a pleasant responsibility but one that Congress has to own, and that Republicans in Congress have to accept.\xc2\xa0 They appropriate, they pass bills that require funding, they need to pay those bills.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what raising the debt ceiling is about.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about new spending; it\xe2\x80\x99s about the money you put on a credit card and the bill that comes every month.\xc2\xa0 And this is basic stuff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can ask you about something that some are saying should be discussed by President Obama and President Hollande -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a rail company that is owned primarily by the French government owned -- its parent company SNCF.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bidding on the Purple Line project in Maryland, huge transportation contract with the state.\xc2\xa0 And historians say that SNCF carried Jews and other Nazi prisoners to the French-German border on the way to concentration camps, and now there\xe2\x80\x99s critics -- Democrats and Republicans in Congress in the state of Maryland as well who say that the rail company under this company -- I know it\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat convoluted -- should be paying restitution to the victims if it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be allowed to bid on a contract because it\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. taxpayer money.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that President Obama will address with President Hollande?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 Generally, and when it comes to the specific question about what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to discuss, I would wait for both Presidents to read out their discussions to you.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a preview.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we have a broad and deep relationship with our oldest ally, and there will be many issues that the two leaders will discuss.</p>\n<p>On the broader question, it sounds like maybe Department of Transportation and others may be of more help to you, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to look into it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually a state issue, but now --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just -- Brianna, I just confess I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the details of it so I would hesitate to provide an answer, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the question.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in the op-ed today the two Presidents start off by talking about Iran and they hail success in what they call rolling back elements of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 But today there are reports about Iranian warships moving closer to U.S. borders. There\xe2\x80\x99s also reports where Iran is claiming that they successfully tested two missiles.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could react to those reports and answer whether or not that casts more doubt on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s intentions in these talks.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, there was an Iranian announcement that they are moving ships close to the United States and we have no evidence that Iran is, in fact, sending ships close to the U.S. border.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the second issue, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on that, but I can tell you that we have been clear that even as we work with the P5-plus-1 to test the hypothesis that Iran is ready to meet its obligations to the international community with regards to its nuclear program, that we are at odds with Iran on a number of issues and we continue to press hard both directly as the United States and with our international partners on those issues.\xc2\xa0 And that includes matters regarding missiles.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific response to that.\xc2\xa0 Maybe State does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- you\xe2\x80\x99re raising doubt about whether they\xe2\x80\x99re moving warships closer to the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reason to believe --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is FOX reporting that they\xe2\x80\x99re moving warships closer to the U.S.?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was reported over the weekend that, as you say, they claim that.\xc2\xa0 They also claimed today \xe2\x80\x93- and it\xe2\x80\x99s reported by AFP and many other wires -- that they say they successfully tested missiles.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe them or do you --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific answer to that report.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we can get it to you and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure State has it. What I can tell you is that we continue to have major disagreements with Iran and we press very hard -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s their support for international terrorism, for Hezbollah, or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement of existing sanctions, we are not letting up on Iran on a wide variety of issues where we are profoundly in disagreement with them, and have rallied an international consensus around that fact.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you also comment on -\xe2\x80\x93 you spoke earlier about Michael Sam\xe2\x80\x99s announcement.\xc2\xa0 Eric Holder, the Attorney General, made a substantive policy announcement over the weekend about making sure all employees of the Justice Department, anyone representing the U.S. government in court, other arenas, are making sure that same-sex marriage benefits go to as many people as possible.\xc2\xa0 How far-reaching do you think this will be?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Department of Justice for specifics about the Attorney General.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, well, sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into every count of it, but it would seem to be this is a pretty important policy pronouncement from the President\xe2\x80\x99s administration, beyond just what Justice is technically going to do.\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at how important is this to the President.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That American citizens enjoy equal rights?\xc2\xa0 Pretty important; profoundly so.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, going back to this AP drone story, I guess the part I\xe2\x80\x99m confused about is the President laid out that he wanted to shift the decision-making process from the CIA to the Defense Department.\xc2\xa0 In the budget agreement that the House and Senate came up -- it specifically blocked money from being used to do just that.\xc2\xa0 What is the status of the drone?\xc2\xa0 Can you at least say who\xe2\x80\x99s running America\xe2\x80\x99s drone wars?\xc2\xa0 Is it the CIA or is it the Defense Department?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I would point you to what the President actually said, and repeat what I said earlier about the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on how we reach near certainty when it comes to civilian casualties not occurring in targeted strikes, and his views and our views on matters surrounding American citizens who may have taken up arms against the United States and who pose a direct threat to U.S. citizens.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the issues that you raise I would refer you to the content of the speech.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I know the content of the speech said that, but then there was what Congress passed in the budget bill, which was, among other things, also had Gitmo not being allowed any --does this mean the change happened or didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you on it, Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, Senator Menendez is being investigated about whether he has intervened on behalf of these fugitive brothers from Ecuador, the Isaias brothers.\xc2\xa0 He told a colleague of mine on Friday that because the White House \xe2\x80\x93- because the Obama administration has not pursued extradition of these brothers back to Ecuador that it means the Obama administration agrees with Senator Menendez and that the White House agrees with Senator Menendez that they should not be extradited.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any way that you can characterize this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Does anyone else?\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, on issues of extradition I would refer you to State and Justice, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any \xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any specific information on the Isaias brothers?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I do not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of Attorney General Holder, he told The New Yorker today he is going to step down sometime this year.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the President about that report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House or the administration have a position on whether it was rebels or Syrian government that was behind the attacks this week on U.N. envoys?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good question.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that we\xe2\x80\x99re following developments and reports from Homs extremely closely.\xc2\xa0 And we are aware of the conflicting reporting, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- in terms of who is responsible, we\xe2\x80\x99re not in a position to confirm or corroborate these reports at this time.\xc2\xa0 We are looking for further clarity and additional information as well.</p>\n<p>However, it does appear that whoever targeted the humanitarian aid convoys deliberately did not want the food and other assistance to get into Homs.\xc2\xa0 What does that tell you?\xc2\xa0 Based off of past words and actions, we all know which side in this conflict was in the past opposed to getting aid into Homs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re investigating conflicting reports, so we cannot confirm one way or the other at this time, but there is some past practice here and past rhetoric here that suggests who might be responsible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s some discussion of a potential U.N. resolution to make sure the aid does get into Homs.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the U.S. would support?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We support a humanitarian resolution in principle, as do other U.N. Security Council member states.\xc2\xa0 The Security Council must actively support the principle that all barriers preventing humanitarian access to all parts of the country and all civilians be removed immediately.\xc2\xa0 The United States has worked with our partners on the U.N. Security Council to develop a draft resolution that we feel includes provisions that go beyond the October 2nd Security Council presidential statement to address the need for greater humanitarian access.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to work with Security Council member states on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Leslie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, going back to Eric Holder -- a public advocacy group today filed a lawsuit in D.C. seeking to block the agreement between Justice and JPMorgan Chase, saying that it was an overreach of executive power.\xc2\xa0 Given the President was a constitutional scholar, would he agree that this case didn\'t go before a court or a judge --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I would refer you to the Justice Department for that kind of ruling.</p>\n<p>Andrei.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the Olympics -- what can you tell us about the President following the Olympics or not following the Olympics?\xc2\xa0 Did he watch the opening ceremony?\xc2\xa0 What did he think?\xc2\xa0 Any other highlights you want to share?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the President is very excited by the fact that the games are underway.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s been some terrific competition already, some amazing performances including by some American snowboarders.\xc2\xa0 But I have not gotten a detailed readout from the President yet as to which events he was able to catch and which he has just caught up on.\xc2\xa0 But I think everyone here is thrilled that the games are underway and that the competition has been exciting thus far.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And on the other issue, the history -- May was before Snowden came out, right?\xc2\xa0 And basically my question is if Snowden is an American citizen free from the threat of physical harm from his government?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The position of the administration is that Mr. Snowden has been charged with felony offenses and ought to be returned to the United States where he will be accorded the full rights and benefits and due process of those who are accused in our system of justice.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Three topics, one question each.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, the White House expects --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 At least he\xe2\x80\x99s honest about it, right? (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said before the White House expects Russia to conduct the Olympics in a way that welcomes everyone.\xc2\xa0 According to The New York Times over the weekend, at least 61 protestors were arrested nationwide, some over LGBT rights.\xc2\xa0 Is that in line with the President\xe2\x80\x99s view for welcoming --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think broadly speaking, in terms of the matter of LGBT rights in Russia, the President has been very clear, and I think he was clear in his interview with Bob Costas of NBC on the evening of the opening ceremonies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we strongly express our views when it comes to any crackdown on those who are expressing their opinions peacefully. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific with regards to the games themselves on these matters.\xc2\xa0 But our views on them haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Michael Sam, I gather from what you said that the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t reached out to him in the wake of his announcement last night.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you on the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering because Jason Collins -- he called Jason Collins when he came out last year.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do the same thing for Michael.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, Eric Holder\xe2\x80\x99s announcement over the weekend regarding the extension of same-sex rights -- there was a lot of media attention and sort of reaction to that over the weekend for an announcement that basically amounted to complying with a court order so that a spouse wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be forced to testify against their spouse in federal court.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you were surprised by the reaction about that over the weekend.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a characterization to make about the coverage or the reaction except to say that the President believes every American ought to be afforded equal rights.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly supports that instance of his view -- or actions taken that reflect his view in this case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, the second round of the Geneva talks started today.\xc2\xa0 The expectation is pretty low.\xc2\xa0 How do you expect it to be different from the first round?\xc2\xa0 And also, it was reported over the weekend that Iran has been supporting ISIS-al Qaeda in northern Syria, and they give some details of names and operatives and some kind of evidence.\xc2\xa0 Can you share some information with us on that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask you to repeat the second question in a minute.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the second round of discussions did begin today in Geneva and Joint Special Representative Brahimi met with the two sides separately to discuss the agenda of the second round.\xc2\xa0 And we are pleased that these talks will continue, but there is obviously a lot of work ahead.\xc2\xa0 We recognize that this will be a long and difficult process.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more detail about the agenda.\xc2\xa0 We obviously are pressing, together with our partners on this issue, for a negotiated political settlement to the conflict.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to end this conflict.\xc2\xa0 And it is certainly a good thing that the two sides are sitting down together in Geneva.</p>\n<p>And the second question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First on the first one -- so the success to you is basically both sides are staying in the same room and negotiating?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 I said progress.\xc2\xa0 It is important that they are sitting down and together, but there is a long way to go.\xc2\xa0 There is no alternative to a negotiated political settlement in this case.\xc2\xa0 And that is what the Geneva process is all about, is trying to reach that negotiated political settlement on behalf of the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second question is, there were reports that Iran has been supporting ISIS in northern Syria and al Qaeda and they have some detailed information about operatives\xe2\x80\x99 names, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 Can you shed some information, how does this affect the relationship with Iran and the nuclear five, or even separately?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that on all the broader issues that we have with Iran we maintain the exact posture that we did in the past, and that includes Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for its destabilizing efforts in the region, its support for Hezbollah and terrorism and terrorist organizations in general, and it also includes the enforcement of existing sanctions when it comes to its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re very clear-eyed about Iranian behavior.</p>\n<p>We are also working with our international partners, the so-called P5-plus-1, to see whether or not we can resolve this major challenge to the international community and to the safety and security of the people in the region and the world, and that\'s Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapons program, through peaceful diplomacy because it is in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s interests to see whether or not it can be resolved through diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re very clear-eyed about that process and certainly about the broader issues we have with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s conduct around the region and the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is if there is clear evidence that actually they are supporting al Qaeda and ISIS, would there be consequences for it?\xc2\xa0 I\'m not talking about --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying \xe2\x80\x9cif, if.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that our support for a very tough approach to Iran when it supports terrorist organizations will not and has not changed.\xc2\xa0 And separately, we are pursuing with our P5-plus-1 partners the potential for a negotiated resolution to the issue and the challenges posed by Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, a verifiable resolution that would reassure the international community that Iran does not and will not obtain -- does not have and will not obtain a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Goyal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, India is going through major national elections in the next few months, and the ruling party may not be very favorable in the future, but the major candidate is Mr. Narenda Modi, who is a very famous from the BJP party.\xc2\xa0 But his visa has been a problem for the U.S.\xc2\xa0 He is not getting a visa to visit the U.S., even though he\xe2\x80\x99s president and other party leaders --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do you have a question, Goyal?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is that, the President has been briefed on this because since he may be the next Prime Minister of India?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer questions about visas to the State Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, as far as immigration is concerned, millions of people are living -- are underpaid and living under sweatshops and all that, and they are paying taxes.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re asking if they are eligible for the Obama -- this health care program.\xc2\xa0 And also what message the President has for those people who have been paying taxes and living really under the sweatshops and so forth?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\xc2\xa0 Are you speaking about the United States?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here, yes, in the U.S. -- illegal immigrants.\xc2\xa0 They\'re paying taxes and also --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Affordable Care Act does not extend benefits to non-U.S. citizens undocumented immigrants.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what they\'re asking really that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been hoping that the President will come out and support this immigration issue, and they\'re relying on him for the last five plus years.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President believes strongly that working with Democrats and Republicans in Congress, we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 But the Affordable Care Act is very clear on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:21 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
