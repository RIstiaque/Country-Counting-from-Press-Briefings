Brady Press Briefing Room<br/>  \xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">2:33 P.M. EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How is everyone?\xc2\xa0 My only announcement is I endeavor to make this briefing</div> <div class="legacy-para">shorter than this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s Gridiron dinner.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But other than that -- Ms. Loven.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about the bank rescue program \xe2\x80\x93- go ahead.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m just trying to get the podium -- go ahead, sorry.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Talk a little bit about the bank rescue program.\xc2\xa0 I know that the --</div> <div class="legacy-para">(Interruption as podium rises.)\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, bank rescue -- serious, somber.\xc2\xa0 Leverage, lifting out the money, you\xe2\x80\x99re still</div> <div class="legacy-para">only going to get out, as I understand it, between $500 billion and a trillion of these bad</div> <div class="legacy-para">assets, which is about either a quarter or a half -- depending on what it gets to -\xe2\x80\x93 of what</div> <div class="legacy-para">people think is the amount on the books.\xc2\xa0 What is the \xe2\x80\x93- how is that effective?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I think \xe2\x80\x93- let\xe2\x80\x99s understand before we surmise what that number could be, to</div> <div class="legacy-para">understand that one of the things the health assessments on the banks will do is give a</div> <div class="legacy-para">greater understanding of exactly what that is.\xc2\xa0 I do think what Secretary Geithner laid out</div> <div class="legacy-para">today, though, will \xe2\x80\x93- using both public and private money in order to clear from the</div> <div class="legacy-para">balance sheets of these banks toxic or legacy assets is a plan that will get the economy</div> <div class="legacy-para">moving and get credit flowing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s my question \xe2\x80\x93 how do you know it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get the economy moving?\xc2\xa0 If you\'re</div> <div class="legacy-para">only getting at what some say -- as I said again -- either a quarter or half of --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again -- I guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to buy into the premise that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the bad assets and you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know \xe2\x80\x93 if you you\'re saying you don\'t even know</div> <div class="legacy-para">how much is on their books, then why even go ahead with the plan now?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because you guys keep asking for it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, again, look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s</div> <div class="legacy-para">safe to say that these troubled assets are there and Secretary Geithner and the President</div> <div class="legacy-para">are taking strong action through this plan to get them off the balance sheets and to get</div> <div class="legacy-para">credit moving again.\xc2\xa0 I think that obviously this is a plan that balances public and private</div> <div class="legacy-para">risk.\xc2\xa0 It allows the market to set the rate so that the government doesn\'t overpay for assets.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And we\'re confident that, as the President said, that this will take steps in the right</div> <div class="legacy-para">direction in order to remove these from balance sheets and get credit flowing again -- loans</div> <div class="legacy-para">that will go to small businesses and families, big businesses alike -- I think is a strong steps in</div> <div class="legacy-para">the right direction.</div> <div class="legacy-para">In terms of the size and the amount, obviously this is a bid use $75 to $100 billion worth</div> <div class="legacy-para">of TARP money to leverage a much larger pool of capital to do this, and I think it\'s -- it\'s</div> <div class="legacy-para">a strong step in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 I would point out, as -- this is one of many steps</div> <div class="legacy-para">that the economic team and the Obama administration have taken since coming to office.\xc2\xa0 This</div> <div class="legacy-para">is yet another facet to this -- the challenges that the economy has faced just through</div> <div class="legacy-para">financial stability, leaving aside the President\'s strong desire to have an Economic</div> <div class="legacy-para">Recovery and Reinvestment Plan that will create jobs and get the economy moving again.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But this is another step in terms of unfreezing credit markets, dealing with home prices and</div> <div class="legacy-para">home foreclosures.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the remaining step, through the health assessments, is to</div> <div class="legacy-para">determine what capital banks might need under a worst case scenario.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I think, again, it\'s a positive step in the right direction and one of many steps that</div> <div class="legacy-para">we\'re taking under -- under this administration to get the economy moving again.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has said this toxic debt plan is almost</div> <div class="legacy-para">certain to fail.\xc2\xa0 He\'s called it a rehash, a recycling of a cash-for-trash plan that was</div> <div class="legacy-para">abandoned -- that was proposed and then abandoned by the Bush administration in the fall.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Any response to that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, look, I -- without responding I guess directly to that, I think</div> <div class="legacy-para">what -- look, the alternative to a plan that manages risk and reward and doesn\'t have the</div> <div class="legacy-para">taxpayers shouldering 100 percent of the burden is to do exactly that and shoulder the whole</div> <div class="legacy-para">thing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I also think that if you look at -- as I said a minute ago, I think this is a system that</div> <div class="legacy-para">also takes into account having market help in determining the price of -- the price of some</div> <div class="legacy-para">of these troubled assets to ensure that the government doesn\'t overpay.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And, look, I think some of Mr. Krugman\'s argument is also -- in some ways deals with a</div> <div class="legacy-para">different aspect of the plan, and that\'s bank capitalization.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I don\'t think</div> <div class="legacy-para">anybody that reads anything about these plans should misunderstand that there is another</div> <div class="legacy-para">step in terms of the health assessments, as I said, of these banks in order to determine,</div> <div class="legacy-para">through public or private means, whether additional capital is needed in order to survive</div> <div class="legacy-para">under the worst case scenario of an even more severe recession than we\'re experiencing right</div> <div class="legacy-para">now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But the President and the team are confident that the plan as outlined will take crucial</div> <div class="legacy-para">steps in freeing up credit and getting the economy moving again.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how do you reassure private investors who might invest in this plan that they might</div> <div class="legacy-para">not -- that they wouldn\'t be subject to the same kind of push-back on, say, executive</div> <div class="legacy-para">bonuses that AIG is facing, since in fact the investors in this plan would be receiving</div> <div class="legacy-para">discounted taxpayer -- discounted investments?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I mean, I think this obviously is a -- this is a different program</div> <div class="legacy-para">than what was set up under or what exists under TARP.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\'s a line that has to</div> <div class="legacy-para">be walked in understanding that the public and the taxpayers shouldn\'t and don\'t want to</div> <div class="legacy-para">shoulder a hundred percent of the risk.\xc2\xa0 But I think the balance that\'s struck here in</div> <div class="legacy-para">sharing that risk and spreading the reward is one that is able to navigate that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Chip.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of navigating, introducing this plan puts you in between Wall Street</div> <div class="legacy-para">executives who are skeptical because of the precise point that was just made, that there</div> <div class="legacy-para">might be some sort of populist backlash, and legislation trying to clawback something from</div> <div class="legacy-para">earnings that they make from this, and populist rage on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 What have you done --</div> <div class="legacy-para">or the administration, what has the administration done to reach out to both sides to make</div> <div class="legacy-para">sure that this works?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, this is a result of extensive discussions with both Capitol</div> <div class="legacy-para">Hill and people both on Wall Street and involved in the market in order to set up a plan</div> <div class="legacy-para">that we think will best achieve the objective of freeing up capital.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think whether</div> <div class="legacy-para">-- I mean, I think the President spoke clearly about this over the weekend in the interview</div> <div class="legacy-para">that he did with "60 Minutes," in understanding that we -- taxpayers are very much correct</div> <div class="legacy-para">that we have to understand and deal with excessive compensation and bonuses.\xc2\xa0 And the</div> <div class="legacy-para">President has outlined a plan to start on that, so that bonuses aren\'t a way of rewarding</div> <div class="legacy-para">people that are not succeeding; bonuses have typically been something that\'s given to people</div> <div class="legacy-para">that are doing well.\xc2\xa0 But also we have to take steps to ensure that whatever is done, is</div> <div class="legacy-para">done in a way that furthers our recovery and stabilizes our financial system.\xc2\xa0 And look,</div> <div class="legacy-para">it\'s something that the President is aware of.</div> <div class="legacy-para">In all honestly, Jake, I don\'t -- I think this is -- this has not been a -- this is not a</div> <div class="legacy-para">new tension.\xc2\xa0 I think this tension has been certainly prevalent if not completely, if it had</div> <div class="legacy-para">lacked -- even if it lacked obviousness, in all honesty, for a long, long time, even dating</div> <div class="legacy-para">back to the -- before the middle of September of last year when bailouts became a word that</div> <div class="legacy-para">more Americans were hearing --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\'s peaking a bit, I mean, in terms of Wall Street skepticism and also populism on</div> <div class="legacy-para">the Hill.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering if you could be a little bit more specific about what specific</div> <div class="legacy-para">outreach you\'ve done.\xc2\xa0 Did the President, once the plan was in place, did he call bicameral,</div> <div class="legacy-para">bipartisan leadership in the Hill and brief them?\xc2\xa0 Did Geithner go to Wall Street and talk</div> <div class="legacy-para">to people there and talk to CEOs?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know -- I know that Secretary Geithner is in New York tonight, obviously</div> <div class="legacy-para">speaking, and I\'m sure that will involve an audience that includes both CEOs and bankers.\xc2\xa0 I</div> <div class="legacy-para">can certainly check.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have in front of me what the -- whether or not the President</div> <div class="legacy-para">talked to -- explicitly to Capitol Hill about this.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But look, I think that is -- that\'s something the President understands, that tension.\xc2\xa0 And</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think the steps that he has taken and will take underscore the notion that we have to deal</div> <div class="legacy-para">with what are sometimes forces that are pulling in opposite directions.\xc2\xa0 I think it</div> <div class="legacy-para">underscores the necessity of working to try to get it right, and not lurching in any one</div> <div class="legacy-para">direction but navigating opposite forces in order to do what\'s right for the economy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, in rolling out the details today, Timothy Geithner used a more, sort of, quiet</div> <div class="legacy-para">approach -- pen-and-pad with reporters, not getting out there on television in a very public</div> <div class="legacy-para">way.\xc2\xa0 Why?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You guys always -- every time we do one of these things, we do a background</div> <div class="legacy-para">briefing, and somebody asks if it can be on the record --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this was a major --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and, you know, we don\'t want just a speech, we\'d like to do some Q&amp;A, and so</div> <div class="legacy-para">we put the Secretary of Treasury out on the record to --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This was a major event.\xc2\xa0 Everyone was waiting for the details, and it almost seemed</div> <div class="legacy-para">like it came out in a less than, sort of, bombastic way.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I guess he\'s worried a little bit less about what the packaging is on the</div> <div class="legacy-para">present, and more importantly, what\xe2\x80\x99s inside of the box.\xc2\xa0 I suppose we could have rigged out</div> <div class="legacy-para">some flags and printed up some placards and cued up some old campaign music, but I think</div> <div class="legacy-para">what\xe2\x80\x99s important -- maybe not for Washington reporters, but what\xe2\x80\x99s more important for the</div> <div class="legacy-para">American people is to get the details of a plan that works to get their bank lending money</div> <div class="legacy-para">again.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think that\'s, in all honesty, what the Americans people care most about.\xc2\xa0 I think if you</div> <div class="legacy-para">objectively look at what this administration has done, or what the economic team has done in</div> <div class="legacy-para">the course of about nine weeks of service, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard-pressed to find nine weeks</div> <div class="legacy-para">where more solutions were outlined of problems and challenges that have been facing this</div> <div class="legacy-para">country probably since the 1930s.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow another question \xe2\x80\x93- Christina Romer, in\xc2\xa0 an interview with CNN earlier</div> <div class="legacy-para">today, talked about how if this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work that we\xe2\x80\x99ll review it \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99ll tweak it, I think</div> <div class="legacy-para">was the exact language that she used.\xc2\xa0 Is there a backup plan if this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work?\xc2\xa0 And to</div> <div class="legacy-para">say "tweak" it, does that sort of instill sort of a lack of confidence that this will</div> <div class="legacy-para">actually work?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do we have a backup plan if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, and if we do have a backup plan,</div> <div class="legacy-para">does that denote that we\'re preparing for it not to work?\xc2\xa0 I want to sift through the</div> <div class="legacy-para">circular --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I asked a backup plan because she said if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work we\'ll "tweak" it.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m</div> <div class="legacy-para">just wondering, does that give a sense of --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it is safe to assume that any policy that this administration or</div> <div class="legacy-para">-- I\'ll speak broadly for any politician in the country -- if they roll out a plan, it\xe2\x80\x99s</div> <div class="legacy-para">constantly evaluated to ensure that the objectives by which the plan was introduced are met</div> <div class="legacy-para">by the implementation of the plan.\xc2\xa0 And if the plan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meet through its implementation</div> <div class="legacy-para">the objectives of what it was outlined to do, that that plan might be augmented to meet</div> <div class="legacy-para">those objectives.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was deep.\xc2\xa0 That was deep.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That was more this than that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On pricing, what makes you confident that they will be able to find prices here that</div> <div class="legacy-para">private investors are attracted to, and what happens if they don\'t?\xc2\xa0 Does this thing just</div> <div class="legacy-para">fail?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- and obviously -- and I think Secretary Geithner talked about this</div> <div class="legacy-para">this morning -- but, look, you have competing interests and putting these two competing</div> <div class="legacy-para">interests together gives each involved an incentive to find a way to do business that</div> <div class="legacy-para">ultimately works for the American people.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously we\'ve talked a lot about the need -- in this room -- for banks to have bad assets</div> <div class="legacy-para">off of their balance sheets.\xc2\xa0 So that gives somebody the incentive to figure out how to do</div> <div class="legacy-para">that in a way that makes sense for them and still provides them that belief.\xc2\xa0 Obviously</div> <div class="legacy-para">having a public-private partnership also gives both taxpayers and private investors that</div> <div class="legacy-para">have the wherewithal to deal with a lot of this stuff -- gives them the incentive to look</div> <div class="legacy-para">for something that makes sense for them and for the taxpayer.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve created basically a supply-and-demand type auction that allows people to</div> <div class="legacy-para">get what they need.\xc2\xa0 That market, through that supply-and-demand model, can set a price that</div> <div class="legacy-para">allows each objective to be met.\xc2\xa0 And I think obviously -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous</div> <div class="legacy-para">incentive for banks to want to take advantage of an opportunity that allows them to get past</div> <div class="legacy-para">some of these bad assets.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will it simply be a free market out there for pricing these assets, or is the</div> <div class="legacy-para">government going to be in there at some point almost as an arbitrator trying to push the two</div> <div class="legacy-para">sides together?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s probably a little early to talk about that.\xc2\xa0 I know there are</div> <div class="legacy-para">people that are interested in the program, as was denoted in the morning papers.\xc2\xa0 And I</div> <div class="legacy-para">think that whenever you have willing buyers and willing sellers, the market can help</div> <div class="legacy-para">instructively set a price that works for both entities and, in this case, something that</div> <div class="legacy-para">will protect the taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 You won\xe2\x80\x99t find the pressure of the government alone shouldering</div> <div class="legacy-para">all of the risk and the burden, willing ultimately to pay much more than an asset might be</div> <div class="legacy-para">worth.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Chuck.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you give us sort of a little bit of a scorecard for the public?\xc2\xa0 So when</div> <div class="legacy-para">are the first purchases?\xc2\xa0 When should we expect to start seeing the first purchases?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think Secretary Geithner did not necessarily give a date, but said that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">obviously and this is -- they\'ve had discussions obviously with the Fed and FDIC about</div> <div class="legacy-para">setting up this structure.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the FDIC has some experience in this, as well as the</div> <div class="legacy-para">ability for each in terms of their role in the financing.\xc2\xa0 So I think this is something that</div> <div class="legacy-para">people will see quite soon.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\'s going to run the public investment corporation?\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be one person</div> <div class="legacy-para">who is going to be like, sort of, a CEO or a manager?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point to -- Treasury might have a more specific answer, if there\'s one</div> <div class="legacy-para">person that does it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, are you comfortable that there is a -- that this is democratized?\xc2\xa0 So, for</div> <div class="legacy-para">instance, that it -- it does seem like this is geared toward getting people with a lot of</div> <div class="legacy-para">money, but there isn\'t a component for Joe in Kansas City, you know, or Jane in Des Moines.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you know a Joe in Kansas City?\xc2\xa0 Like, every example is some Joe in Kansas</div> <div class="legacy-para">City.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s wrong with Kansas City?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The plumber --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, we\'re on a --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look at me, you don\'t think I like Kansas City?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is a (inaudible) meat shop.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the poor Royals franchise.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There you go.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in all seriousness, that they -- that there does seem to be a -- where there wasn\'t</div> <div class="legacy-para">an ask of the American public to sort of get involved in this or -- do you feel like there\'s</div> <div class="legacy-para">enough of a way for average citizens to participate in this?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think -- yes, I think, obviously through investments and obviously</div> <div class="legacy-para">-- look, the taxpayers will share in the reward for assets that do.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, right now it\'s hedge fund guys and pensions plans -- sort of like this --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you know, the same Wall Street that everybody has been beating up on.\xc2\xa0 Is there --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, but, I mean --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like you --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do I think -- you know, we\'ve talked a lot about pension funds and what\'s</div> <div class="legacy-para">happened to them over the course of the last few months.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously them being</div> <div class="legacy-para">involved does give Joe in Kansas City the ability, through an investment in his pension</div> <div class="legacy-para">fund, to do well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Jonathon.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You got a couple of big things happening on Capitol Hill this week.\xc2\xa0 First, if the</div> <div class="legacy-para">Senate moves forward with its -- toward its bonus legislation -- there was a sense at the</div> <div class="legacy-para">end of last week that what happened to Chris Dodd nobody wants happening to them.\xc2\xa0 And they</div> <div class="legacy-para">felt like, you know, if they did anything that would look like watering down a bonus bill,</div> <div class="legacy-para">they would be excoriated and that the White House or the administration would not bail them</div> <div class="legacy-para">out; that there was a sense that Dodd kind of twisted in the wind until Thursday, when</div> <div class="legacy-para">finally Tim Geithner said, yes, it was us that asked for that change.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I\'m wondering, first, are you guys sensing that -- that you have dance partners on Capitol</div> <div class="legacy-para">Hill to deal with some of the issues you\'ve raised about these bonus legislations?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m don\'t --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel -- are there Senators there who are willing to talk to you about your</div> <div class="legacy-para">concerns that some of this legislation may be going too far?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think what the White House would communicate to Capitol Hill, to</div> <div class="legacy-para">any member, to both sides, is exactly, again, what the President talked about -- how he</div> <div class="legacy-para">would ultimately evaluate any legislation, which I had repeated earlier, which is to</div> <div class="legacy-para">understand that we cannot and should not reward failure with bonuses, and the message that</div> <div class="legacy-para">would send, but also to make sure that we don\'t do harm to the financial system.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you finding a receptive audience?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if they just heard what I said, but I hope it was received well.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Second, the budget bills are going to be rolled out this week, as well.\xc2\xa0 And I</div> <div class="legacy-para">wonder if now you can talk about how appropriate you feel it would be to do a national</div> <div class="legacy-para">health plan with reconciliation language so that it couldn\'t filibustered.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the debate on reconciliation is months and months and months</div> <div class="legacy-para">ahead of itself.\xc2\xa0 I think if anybody is concerned about how this is going to be resolved,</div> <div class="legacy-para">the best way is the exact way the President answered a question, I think, to a Republican</div> <div class="legacy-para">member of Congress at the first event we had here where the President took questions.\xc2\xa0 And</div> <div class="legacy-para">that is, the best way to resolve the rising cost of health care is to have entities from all</div> <div class="legacy-para">sides come together to find a solution.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what -- that\'s the priority of this</div> <div class="legacy-para">administration and certainly of this President.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think the notion that something that might happen in August and September, when it\'s still</div> <div class="legacy-para">chilly outside and we\'re only in late March, I think gives a lot of short shrift to the</div> <div class="legacy-para">notion that people in this town ought to be able to work together to find solutions to some</div> <div class="legacy-para">of our biggest problems.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on that, what some Republicans -- Judd Gregg, for instance -- are saying that if</div> <div class="legacy-para">you have reconciliation language in these budgets on health care, then the liberals who will</div> <div class="legacy-para">be pushing one agenda on health care will know that they have the upper hand, because if you</div> <div class="legacy-para">fail to get some bipartisan deal, then always fall back and --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- two points on that.\xc2\xa0 One is, I think that gives, again, short shrift</div> <div class="legacy-para">to the notion that people should have good ideas about a problem we\'ve talked about for</div> <div class="legacy-para">several decades; there isn\'t a lack of good ideas out there.\xc2\xa0 And the second thing I might</div> <div class="legacy-para">mention is it is interesting to see the views on reconciliation and how they\'ve changed</div> <div class="legacy-para">since, say, the Bush tax cuts in 2001.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Mark.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you say definitively now that the President won\'t sign the House-passed</div> <div class="legacy-para">bonus tax bill?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would repeat exactly what he said last night, which is --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, he declined to embrace it, certainly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, he -- I guess the -- well, let me tell you what I heard, and we can argue</div> <div class="legacy-para">about that.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President, I believe, said that the bill would be evaluated again on</div> <div class="legacy-para">the two pillars with which I talked about.\xc2\xa0 And, you know, I think to get ahead of where</div> <div class="legacy-para">anybody else is in understanding that the process will go through the Senate, and we will</div> <div class="legacy-para">certainly evaluate whatever were to come down Pennsylvania Avenue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a related issue, do you feel or does the President feel that the American people</div> <div class="legacy-para">are beginning to suffer from bailout fatigue, with all of the bailouts going on, and today</div> <div class="legacy-para">you announced yet another new bailout program for the toxic assets?\xc2\xa0 How do you go about</div> <div class="legacy-para">dealing with that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the American people very much lament, as does the President</div> <div class="legacy-para">and everyone in his administration, that we find ourselves at the point today that we do,</div> <div class="legacy-para">because of any number of factors that have led up to this point that find ourselves facing a</div> <div class="legacy-para">declining jobs market, a home foreclosure crisis, a financial stability crisis, a lack of</div> <div class="legacy-para">appropriate regulation in the market that matches where we are and the advanced technical</div> <div class="legacy-para">nature of our financial system.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But I think the American people as -- again, as the President said last night, I think he</div> <div class="legacy-para">wants the American people to understand that the steps that he\'s outlining and that we\'re</div> <div class="legacy-para">taking today will help free up money in the system so that they can borrow money again, so</div> <div class="legacy-para">that their small business that has a spotless credit rating isn\'t hounded to get money every</div> <div class="legacy-para">two weeks from a bank because -- not of their doing but of something in the larger financial</div> <div class="legacy-para">system; or that if -- again, if they\'ve got a good credit history but can\'t find a willing</div> <div class="legacy-para">bank to borrow money to send their child to college, that the steps that are being taken,</div> <div class="legacy-para">and I explained a little bit of this, obviously there is -- there can be a tension between</div> <div class="legacy-para">Wall Street and Main Street, but I think the President was clear that we\'re all in this boat</div> <div class="legacy-para">together and that the only way that we\'re going to get this economy moving again is to do a</div> <div class="legacy-para">series of things:\xc2\xa0 invest in the recovery; reregulate our financial industry; deal with home</div> <div class="legacy-para">foreclosures; but also stabilize our financial system -- that all of these have to be done</div> <div class="legacy-para">together.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Look, the truth is, Mark, that today\'s announcement alone is not going to fix our economy,</div> <div class="legacy-para">just as any individual piece of this taken in only itself isn\'t going to alone fix the</div> <div class="legacy-para">economy.\xc2\xa0 But all these things together can help what ails the system, free up credit,</div> <div class="legacy-para">create jobs, put money back in people\'s pockets, and get the economy moving again.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At enormous expense.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 At an enormous expense that the President believes should be done in a more</div> <div class="legacy-para">transparent way so that the benefits can be recouped by the taxpayers and that our economy</div> <div class="legacy-para">can get growing again.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back to the bonus legislation, does the President or the White House have some</div> <div class="legacy-para">suggested language for the Senate to consider?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, no.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you leaving hands off, letting them work their will upon it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can certainly check and see if there\'s any updates to a legislative strategy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going to jump into it at the House-Senate conference committee?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'re ahead of the process by at least a good step.\xc2\xa0 So --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t hear you saying that you\'re going to guide the Senate or offer them some</div> <div class="legacy-para">language, so I assume --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'d check on the update of where we are and tell you the way the</div> <div class="legacy-para">President would evaluate legislation that might come out of something like a conference</div> <div class="legacy-para">committee.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other thing.\xc2\xa0 Is there any financial regulatory package coming this week?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe Secretary Geithner will testify Thursday -- I\'m not sure if it\'s on</div> <div class="legacy-para">the House or the Senate side -- and begin to outline principles for regulatory reform that</div> <div class="legacy-para">we hope will pass by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 And obviously you know that this will be a big</div> <div class="legacy-para">topic in a week or so, when we go to London.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to roll it out at the hearing?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the President think of the formation of this group of moderates?\xc2\xa0 Is it</div> <div class="legacy-para">designed to sabotage his agenda by Democrats?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Look -- no, I think for a long time we\'ve had groups of like-minded</div> <div class="legacy-para">legislators that have banded together to make -- and embrace policy prescriptions that they</div> <div class="legacy-para">think are the best way to solve the challenges that we face.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think he looks forward to working with anybody in the Senate not constrained by their</div> <div class="legacy-para">membership in one area or constrained by any label.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, isn\'t it premature to try to undermine these programs?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the assembling of a group of moderate either Democrats or</div> <div class="legacy-para">Republicans the President certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see as undermining his agenda.\xc2\xa0 I think in many</div> <div class="legacy-para">ways seeking solutions to these challenges is something the President would hope everyone</div> <div class="legacy-para">does and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t provide any impediment to what he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to do.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Major.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one on the FDIC and one on executive compensation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Treasury and the</div> <div class="legacy-para">Fed are part of this, the private investors are, but the largest component of this credit</div> <div class="legacy-para">system to absorb the toxic assets is the FDIC.\xc2\xa0 And most Americans who think about that as</div> <div class="legacy-para">thinking about the guarantor of their own savings accounts.\xc2\xa0 What can you say to those</div> <div class="legacy-para">Americans who might hear this and understand that the FDIC is going to be the biggest player</div> <div class="legacy-para">in this to ensure that their confidence in their own savings remains valid and what steps</div> <div class="legacy-para">the administration is going to take to make sure the FDIC can not only do this task, but its</div> <div class="legacy-para">central task, which is protecting depositors?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you can -- I think the American people can reasonably be assured</div> <div class="legacy-para">that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be taking steps forward with the chair of the FDIC if both the President</div> <div class="legacy-para">and the FDIC weren\xe2\x80\x99t very assured that this was the right step to take and that the function</div> <div class="legacy-para">that they have performed for a long, long time would in any way be undermined.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I think Secretary Geithner was asked this question at his briefing this morning, as</div> <div class="legacy-para">well, and I think the notion that -- he reassured those that the FDIC can do, as you</div> <div class="legacy-para">mentioned, the primary function that most Americans would associate with it, as well as</div> <div class="legacy-para">their ability to take on an additional role and shoulder a burden for the taxpayers.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On executive compensation, there were some reports this weekend that the administration</div> <div class="legacy-para">is open to limits on executive compensation for publicly traded companies that have nothing</div> <div class="legacy-para">to do with TARP, that aren\xe2\x80\x99t asking for any government financing for anything.\xc2\xa0 Is that</div> <div class="legacy-para">true, number one?\xc2\xa0 And number two, if you are a buyer into this program, if you are helping</div> <div class="legacy-para">the government soak up some of these toxic assets, should you assume that if you enter that</div> <div class="legacy-para">pool you might, yourself, as a company or a equity fund or investment house, be limited or</div> <div class="legacy-para">subject to future executive compensation limits?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as I mentioned earlier, I think the program that was outlined today</div> <div class="legacy-para">is separate from what has previously been outlined in the TARP program.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, no?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so are publicly traded firms.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration open to that all?\xc2\xa0 Does it</div> <div class="legacy-para">think it needs to change the culture there?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think the President has talked broadly about this, but I think details</div> <div class="legacy-para">of a proposal on that are ahead of itself.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the administration at least is open to that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President previously supported providing shareholders with a</div> <div class="legacy-para">non-binding vote, a say on their pay, that through public opinion, the White House believes</div> <div class="legacy-para">would sway executive compensation.\xc2\xa0 But --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s a bottom-up, not a government --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any details far beyond that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- about the government doing this?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Mike.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the head of the European Central Bank said that Europe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to</div> <div class="legacy-para">increase spending more to combat the financial crisis.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the administration</div> <div class="legacy-para">about what appears to be kind of a growing opposition in Europe to further stimulus</div> <div class="legacy-para">spending, which seems to be a direct contradiction to what the President wants?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I actually think that there -- well, I think the President has talked to,</div> <div class="legacy-para">and will talk to even more leaders that will be involved in the G20 throughout this week --</div> <div class="legacy-para">obviously Prime Minister Rudd will be here tomorrow and he\xe2\x80\x99s got some calls scheduled for</div> <div class="legacy-para">later in the week.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But I think that certainly coming out of the finance ministers\xe2\x80\x99 meeting a few weeks ago,</div> <div class="legacy-para">there was actually broad agreement that -- and the administration, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said from here,</div> <div class="legacy-para">has never -- there was never any intention to have everybody sign a document that required a</div> <div class="legacy-para">certain level or percentage of spending relating to their GDP, as was mentioned -- as the</div> <div class="legacy-para">IMF suggested.\xc2\xa0 But I believe that what was agreed on at that meeting was to continue to</div> <div class="legacy-para">monitor what might be needed to stimulate economies in order to address the downturn in</div> <div class="legacy-para">production that each economy will see as part of a global recession.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I think the President will address this more tomorrow and throughout the week -- that I</div> <div class="legacy-para">think there is a lot of commonality in the agenda that the administration will pursue and</div> <div class="legacy-para">that other nations in the G20 will discuss next week at the summit, including, again,</div> <div class="legacy-para">monitoring the spending situation to ensure that if the recession becomes deeper or more</div> <div class="legacy-para">severe, that steps might be taken; that financial regulation is something that is enormously</div> <div class="legacy-para">important in a changing world; and lastly, that -- I know there is strong agreement that as</div> <div class="legacy-para">their markets have shrunk quickly because of this global recession, that exports have been</div> <div class="legacy-para">pulled back greatly, particularly those in more developing nations, that funding and help go</div> <div class="legacy-para">to those developing nations through the IMF in order to spur job creation and exports here</div> <div class="legacy-para">in this country.</div> <div class="legacy-para">You know, the President I think will probably use the same term on this -- I think you\'ll</div> <div class="legacy-para">hear him say this later this week -- that he looks at the London economic summit as an</div> <div class="legacy-para">agenda that is both/and rather than either/or.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Sheryl.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a spokesman for Mikhail Gorbachev says that the President met Mr. Gorbachev</div> <div class="legacy-para">here at the White House on Friday.\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us about what they talked about?\xc2\xa0 And</div> <div class="legacy-para">why didn\'t the White House disclose the meeting?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe it was in the guidance that the Vice President was meeting with Mr.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Gorbachev.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the President.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President tends to roam around the larger house, and sometimes walks</div> <div class="legacy-para">into meetings that weren\'t previously on his schedule.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He could roam -- he could roam here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we did that once, and it seemed like Bourbon Street on Fat Tuesday.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">(Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what did they talk about?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What group did he -- (laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President -- well, look, obviously Vice President Biden met with the former</div> <div class="legacy-para">Soviet President Gorbachev, and obviously they discussed continued ways in which the United</div> <div class="legacy-para">States and Russia can work together to reduce our nuclear arsenal.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s going to</div> <div class="legacy-para">be part of the upcoming topic when President Obama and President Medvedev meet in London;</div> <div class="legacy-para">that we continue to talk about ways in which we can further the agenda on mutual interests</div> <div class="legacy-para">like nuclear proliferation; on energy; on a whole host of ideas.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he try to solicit Mr. Gorbachev\'s thoughts on missile defense and perhaps how to</div> <div class="legacy-para">secure cooperation with the Russians on that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can certainly check on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that was discussed in the</div> <div class="legacy-para">meeting.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the assets program, briefly.\xc2\xa0 Eventually, and especially if the program takes</div> <div class="legacy-para">off, you\'re going to have to go back to Congress for more money.\xc2\xa0 Do you think they\'re</div> <div class="legacy-para">likely to stump up substantial amounts of money to help private investors make money off of</div> <div class="legacy-para">--</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the American people and I think Congress and I think the President and</div> <div class="legacy-para">the administration are focused not on what has to happen months from now or longer than</div> <div class="legacy-para">that, but how best to implement a program that will get the economy moving again.\xc2\xa0 I think</div> <div class="legacy-para">it\'s wildly premature to get -- to get a whole lot farther down the road on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow up on the question about Gorbachev.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden, prior to</div> <div class="legacy-para">that, met with a different Russian delegation, with some business people.\xc2\xa0 Is he the point</div> <div class="legacy-para">man now at the White House on relations with Russian?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think he\'s the point person.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously the Vice President</div> <div class="legacy-para">plays an extraordinarily important role in this administration\'s foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 He has</div> <div class="legacy-para">great experience through many years serving on the Foreign Relations Committee, and I think</div> <div class="legacy-para">is a valued member that the President leans on repeatedly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you remember a meeting on Russian policy where the President directly participated?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Where he didn\'t participate?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where he directly participated -- the President.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just told you he was at Sheryl\'s secret meeting just a minute ago.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m glad you called it "secret," Robert.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- Sheryl\'s secret meeting.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t say it was secret.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was talking more about strategy -- strategy-setting meetings here at the White House,</div> <div class="legacy-para">not with guests.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, oh.\xc2\xa0 I can look back at his schedule, but I think it\'s safe to assume that</div> <div class="legacy-para">we\'ve discussed, as has been written, developments on policy that either is bilateral policy</div> <div class="legacy-para">with Russia or policy that includes Russia as one of many that take part in important</div> <div class="legacy-para">issues.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last thing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I have to get to Ann -- I\'m all Russia\'d out.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what happened to the word "toxic"?\xc2\xa0 Do you have some marketing czar now who</div> <div class="legacy-para">decided that "legacy loans" is more attractive to private investors than the word "toxic"?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I used "toxic" earlier, so if the -- if there\'s a marketing czar, I\'ve</div> <div class="legacy-para">failed to get his or her memo.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what does the President --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe I didn\'t read my own memo.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Sorry, go ahead.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the President hoping to communicate tomorrow night with the press conference?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as he\'s done over the past -- certainly the better part of the</div> <div class="legacy-para">past week, whether it\'s on "The Tonight Show" or on "60 Minutes," is to address directly</div> <div class="legacy-para">with the American people that challenges that the country faces and the choices that he\'s</div> <div class="legacy-para">working on with Congress to put our economy back on track and put the nation back on firmer</div> <div class="legacy-para">footing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think the -- I think the President has -- believes that a continued dialogue with the</div> <div class="legacy-para">American people about where we are and where we\'re going is necessary certainly in times</div> <div class="legacy-para">like this to give people a sense of what we\'re doing and a sense of where we\'re going; that</div> <div class="legacy-para">they may or may not like all the decisions that he makes, but I think he believes it\'s</div> <div class="legacy-para">important that they understand why he\'s making the decisions that he is.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there will be an opening statement?\xc2\xa0 Lengthy?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not lengthy -- well, I guess it depends on your definition of lengthy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, two, three hours.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gridiron-lengthy?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I want to note that Chuck said that about the Gridiron, not me.</div> <div class="legacy-para">April.\xc2\xa0 Ms. Ryan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 For your lengthy question.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anyway --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just playing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I know.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 On the continued dialogue issue, will there be any news</div> <div class="legacy-para">tomorrow night --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that largely depends on the many important and impressive reporters</div> <div class="legacy-para">assembled in the room in which they will ask the President cutting questions and elicit</div> <div class="legacy-para">news.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, you know what I\'m talking about.\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about an opening statement.\xc2\xa0 Stop</div> <div class="legacy-para">being flip.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If I can\'t be flip, April, this is going to be pretty darn boring, isn\'t it?\xc2\xa0 I</div> <div class="legacy-para">guess we\'ll just have to go back to the lower podium.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">I have not -- I have not read the full opening statement yet, but I will make sure that if</div> <div class="legacy-para">there is news, that the news reporters are apprised of such.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, all right.\xc2\xa0 Also --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In defense of Gridiron, I want to say the Vice President was half-hour late.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, well, I\'m going to get somebody down here to give a 30-second response to</div> <div class="legacy-para">that, Helen.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one more question on the economy.\xc2\xa0 As the President is trying to save this</div> <div class="legacy-para">economy, the global economy is suffering as well, and this country has in the past borrowed</div> <div class="legacy-para">money from other countries, particularly China.\xc2\xa0 What happens if some of these countries</div> <div class="legacy-para">call their debts due from the United States?\xc2\xa0 You know, many of have said it would</div> <div class="legacy-para">destabilize this country.\xc2\xa0 What happens?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, two points on that.\xc2\xa0 One, this certainly came up a few weeks ago when --</div> <div class="legacy-para">relating to the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 And I think said then and I would said again that this country</div> <div class="legacy-para">remains the strongest and deepest capital market on the planet and the safest investment</div> <div class="legacy-para">that anybody could make.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Secondly, I would say that the President recognizes that we have to change our path of --</div> <div class="legacy-para">our fiscal path and put ourselves back on one that\'s far more sustainable than what we\'ve</div> <div class="legacy-para">seen recently.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the budget that he sent to Capitol Hill makes investments that</div> <div class="legacy-para">will grow our economy, but most importantly will cut the deficit in half in his first term;</div> <div class="legacy-para">that the President recognizes that we can\'t continue to do what\'s been done with simply</div> <div class="legacy-para">passing debt on to different generations.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If a country does call some of the money due, are we -- no, it\'s a serious question.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t say it wasn\'t a serious question; it\'s a seriously hypothetical</div> <div class="legacy-para">question and one I\'m not --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\'s a reality -- it could be a reality in this tough global economic recession.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April, I -- the minute it becomes a reality, I assume your hand will be straight</div> <div class="legacy-para">up in the air and I will call on you then.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the EPA has forwarded its endangerment finding to the White House.\xc2\xa0 Can you</div> <div class="legacy-para">enlighten us on whether there\'s an actual plan?\xc2\xa0 Are they recommending a scheme for</div> <div class="legacy-para">regulation?\xc2\xa0 And could you also talk about the timing of it, how quickly --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think something popped up right before I came out here and I haven\'t</div> <div class="legacy-para">delved into this.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- I think the President has made quite clear on this that he</div> <div class="legacy-para">is -- the way to deal with greenhouse gases is to work with Congress in order to put</div> <div class="legacy-para">together a plan that deals with this and creates a market for renewable energy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">As you know, the Supreme Court, through their ruling, requires the EPA to look at the</div> <div class="legacy-para">potential public health risk that CO2 might cause, and I think that is -- not having seen</div> <div class="legacy-para">it, I think this is the -- just a step in that process.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Steve.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the President sent out his political operation into the field over the weekend,</div> <div class="legacy-para">going door to door all over the country to muster support for the budget.\xc2\xa0 What\'s your --</div> <div class="legacy-para">what\'s your -- what have you heard?\xc2\xa0 How did it go?\xc2\xa0 What kind of reaction did they get?\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And is it producing anything?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the only number I heard this morning was that about a million doors were</div> <div class="legacy-para">knocked on over the course of the weekend in order to build support for the President\'s plan</div> <div class="legacy-para">to make the important investments in health care, energy independence, and education reform,</div> <div class="legacy-para">and put ourselves back on that path toward fiscal sustainability, all of which is contained</div> <div class="legacy-para">in the budget.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I think the President believes that whenever the public can get more greatly involved in</div> <div class="legacy-para">the process, as Congress starts through committees this week and on the floor next week,</div> <div class="legacy-para">approving a budget for next year, that that involvement, and hearing the opinions of people</div> <div class="legacy-para">that are reached through that door-knocking, are important in the process.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it producing emails, phone calls?\xc2\xa0 And do you have a goal on how many people you</div> <div class="legacy-para">want to call in or send their messages to Congress?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check and see on that.\xc2\xa0 I would say if we knocked on a million doors, then</div> <div class="legacy-para">our goal was probably 750,000.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President see a rebuff or any signs of hope in Iran\'s response to his message?\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And have you guys made any assessment as to how deeply this has penetrated into Iranian</div> <div class="legacy-para">society, how much the (inaudible) has been passed, et cetera?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on -- if there were any Internet metrics that are important.\xc2\xa0 Look,</div> <div class="legacy-para">the President, as you heard him talk about in the message, this was an effort and an</div> <div class="legacy-para">opportunity to speak directly to the Iranian people and their leaders, to underscore the</div> <div class="legacy-para">potential for a new and changed relationship based on our shared rights and</div> <div class="legacy-para">responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 The President believes it\'s time for that change.\xc2\xa0 And regardless of any</div> <div class="legacy-para">response or -- the President is hopeful that the Iranian leadership will work to change the</div> <div class="legacy-para">way that they do business.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Thanks, guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  3:21 P.M.
