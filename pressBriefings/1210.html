CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good morning.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You guys ready?\xc2\xa0 I just want -- before I take your questions, I wanted to remind everybody why we\xe2\x80\x99re here, for the Winning the Future Forum on Small Business.\xc2\xa0 As you know, in addition to the President of the United States, we have Cabinet members attending the event, and that includes the Treasury Secretary, Commerce Secretary, Labor Secretary, Energy Secretary, the SBA Administrator, the CEA Chair, and Gene Sperling, the National Economic Director.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President talked about the need for innovation and for businesses in particular and small businesses to be the engine of growth in our economy.\xc2\xa0 And he wants to hear from small business owners in this forum about what drives success and what barriers lie in the way of success.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cleveland is actually a city that\xe2\x80\x99s done a great deal of positive work in positioning itself in both the field of biotechnology and clean energy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s really poised to be a global leader in the 21st century in these new industries, and the President is obviously very excited about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So from here on there will be other events similar to this that Cabinet secretaries will participate in.\xc2\xa0 This is not just a one-time deal.\xc2\xa0 It was a major theme of the President\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address and will continue to be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, with that, I will take your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Libya, can you tell us what is going on behind the scenes at the White House?\xc2\xa0 And also, is there concern that unlike in Egypt, there is nothing that you can really do, there\xe2\x80\x99s no real ties with Libya and there\xe2\x80\x99s very little the administration can do in that situation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first let me point you to the fact that on Friday, while we were on this plane, the President issued a statement condemning the violence in Libya, the use of violence against peaceful protesters in Libya as well as two other countries.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the Secretary of State issued a very strongly worded statement condemning the violence and expressing our great alarm at the violence used against peaceful protesters.\xc2\xa0 We offer our condolences to the families of the victims in Libya of this appalling violence.\xc2\xa0 And the Secretary of State will speak again today at approximately 2:30 p.m. where she will address some of these issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President speak about this today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a -- can you give us anything on the death of the hostages at the hands of the pirates?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, for details about what happened I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the President was notified this morning at 4:42 a.m. by Homeland Security director -- or advisor, rather, John Brennan about the outcome in which the four American citizens\xe2\x80\x99 lives were lost, the tragic outcome of that event.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President did, over the weekend on Saturday, authorize the use of force in the case of imminent -- of an imminent threat to those hostages, and that\xe2\x80\x99s -- for other details I can refer you to the Defense Department.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there, do you think, measures that -- the Security Council is meeting today on Libya -- are there international measures that the U.S. can take with its partners to try and affect what\xe2\x80\x99s going on inside Libya, or is it a question of lacking substantial leverage?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is activity at the United Nations Security Council today.\xc2\xa0 We are participating in meetings.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to working with the international community so that the international community speaks with one voice in condemning the violence.\xc2\xa0 And we feel like when the international community speaks with one voice, it can be most effective, so we are obviously participating fully in that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House having any conversations with other world leaders about -- the President himself having any conversations with world leaders about Libya?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements on presidential conversations right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oil is at a two-year high.\xc2\xa0 How closely is the President monitoring the situation in Libya?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, when there is unrest in the world and specifically in that region, that can affect oil prices.\xc2\xa0 We are closely monitoring that situation, but I would not speculate on where oil prices would go in the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the events of the last few days have shown perhaps that the attempts to kind of rehabilitate Qaddafi -- particularly the Europeans sort of took part in it the last administration as well -- were a mistake?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99ll say, Steve, is that the future of Libya needs to be decided by the Libyan people.\xc2\xa0 As is the case throughout the region, our policy is -- pertains in Libya or towards Libya as it did -- does to Egypt, to Bahrain and other countries, which is that we call very strongly for an end to the use of violence against peaceful protesters.\xc2\xa0 We call for respect for the universal rights that these -- peoples of this region, as peoples all around the world, have:\xc2\xa0 the right to peaceful assembly, to freedom of expression.\xc2\xa0 And we recognize their legitimate aspirations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We call on the governments of the region to listen to and respect the legitimate aspirations of their people and to reform accordingly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a labor rally in Columbus about the time that the President is here.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s of course the unrest in Wisconsin.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re also seeing it in Ohio and Indiana, and there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a large protest of teachers in early March over labor rules proposed by that legislature.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to address any of that today?\xc2\xa0 And does he have any thoughts on this ongoing situation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on what the President will say today.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s focused very much -- with regard to that, he\xe2\x80\x99s focused very much on this important forum, small business forum.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as far as his thoughts, he expressed them in an interview with a Wisconsin television station -- I believe it was last week -- where he made clear that he absolutely recognizes the need that state governments have, governors and legislators, to deal with their fiscal situation; that everyone needs to tighten their belts, and that includes public sector employees.\xc2\xa0 But he also expressed his concern that the efforts specifically in Wisconsin were aimed at going right after the collective bargaining rights of unions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo -- but that\xe2\x80\x99s the extent of the White House involvement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about Kasich\xe2\x80\x99s efforts in Ohio to go after collective bargaining?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his reaction to the House vote at 4:40 a.m. in the morning, Saturday morning?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we continue to believe that we will be able to work out common ground on these issues.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the fact that all four leaders of Congress, leaders of the House, leaders of the Senate, have expressed their confidence that we can work this out before March 4th, and we believe we can.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration stand by a veto threat if the House-passed package gets to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk with those big cuts?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position was clearly stated in that statement of administration policy.\xc2\xa0 That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any contingency plans yet?\xc2\xa0 Are you still working on any plans for a shutdown?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Office of Management and Budget, which is the agency within the executive branch that needs to deal with these sorts of things.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d simply state that there have been contingency plans for government shutdowns since 1980, and those plans are obviously updated accordingly, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve been around for a long time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said 1980?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 1980 is what I understand, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to Ken Baer at OMB.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How confident are you that a shutdown can be avoided?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said, we believe, as do the leaders of the House and the Senate, including Senator McConnell and Speaker Boehner -- we agree with them that we do not want a shutdown of the government and that we can come to an agreement that avoids that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any comment on the Iranian warships going through the Suez Canal today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nothing new beyond what I said Friday, I think it was, which was that we monitor that situation closely.\xc2\xa0 And obviously Iranian behavior in the region is something we always watch.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnything else before we land, which looks to be in about --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any minute.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- two minutes to three minutes?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone to get hurt.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are you good?\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:49 A.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
