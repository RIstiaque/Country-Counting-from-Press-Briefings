Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:31 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY: Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions I wanted to mention something that I think is breaking now, as Wolf Blitzer would say, and that is that on Sunday, May 26th, the President will travel to the Oklahoma City area to see firsthand the response to the devastating tornadoes and severe weather that have impacted the area on Sunday night and Monday.\xc2\xa0 He will visit with affected families as well as thank first responders.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has directed his administration to provide all available resources to support the response, led by the Governor and her team.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMore detail on the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel will be released when available.\xc2\xa0 With that, I\'ll go to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Nedra.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I have some questions, but first, happy birthday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re very kind.\xc2\xa0 Thank you -- 29 forever.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First on the IRS controversy, given that you all had pledged your full cooperation with the investigations on Capitol Hill, what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House response to Lois Lerner taking the Fifth Amendment today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me say that, as you heard from the President immediately after the release of the independent Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s audit, he is absolutely committed to finding out everything that happened here, finding out who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for the failures, holding them accountable, and ensuring that the IRS take steps so that this will never happen again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, within the immediate aftermath of the release of that report, Secretary Lew, acting on the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction, accepted the resignation of the acting IRS commissioner and the President appointed a new acting IRS commissioner.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you also know, the responsibilities that Secretary Lew has assigned to Danny Werfel in that job through Secretary Lew\xc2\xa0 -- the President has, rather, through Secretary Lew -- include within 30 days, Commissioner Werfel reporting back to the President and to Secretary Lew about progress made in three areas:\xc2\xa0 One, ensuring the staff who acted inappropriately are held accountable.\xc2\xa0 Two, examining and correcting any failures in the system that allowed this behavior to happen.\xc2\xa0 And three, taking a forward-looking, systemic view of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s organizations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President has directed these actions to be taken at the IRS.\xc2\xa0 Danny Werfel, the new acting commissioner, starts today.\xc2\xa0 Today is his first day.\xc2\xa0 That 30-day review begins today.\xc2\xa0 Additionally, we have made clear that we are cooperating with and will continue to cooperate with congressional oversight.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an important component in a situation like this.\xc2\xa0 And the Department of Justice, the Attorney General has announced a criminal investigation into this matter.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo you see two separate branches of government in three different areas working to find out what happened, to find out who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for the failures, the clear failures, the inappropriate behavior, the improper conduct, to hold them accountable, and to ensure that procedures are put in place so that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How can you find out what happened if a person who\xe2\x80\x99s in Ms. Lerner\xe2\x80\x99s position is taking the Fifth --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As far as the President is concerned -- and I would assume this is true of Congress, and I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming it\xe2\x80\x99s true of the Department of Justice -- there is a commitment here to get to the bottom of what happened, and I can assure you that the President intends to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I talk to you also about the investigation into Benghazi and the report that there are five suspects that are under around-the-clock surveillance?\xc2\xa0 Some lawmakers are raising concerns today that the U.S. might lose these suspects as they\xe2\x80\x99re being monitored to find more evidence.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House share that concern?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have seen the report, and I would refer you, of course, to the FBI on the status of their investigation, which, as you know, is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 What I cannot -- while I can\xe2\x80\x99t discuss, rather, the specifics of that ongoing investigation or the internal deliberations related to it, I can say what the President said on the day after those attacks:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cMake no mistake, we will work with the Libyan government to bring to justice the killers who attacked our people.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I would also point you to something that the Attorney General recently said, which is that we have made very substantial progress in that investigation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President is committed, as he made clear from day one, to two things:\xc2\xa0 Finding and bringing to justice those who killed four Americans.\xc2\xa0 Two -- making sure that the failures that led to the deaths, in terms of security, of four Americans be corrected.\xc2\xa0 And he is, through the FBI investigation that he ordered up, ensuring that the first objective is achieved; and through the process that he instituted through the Secretary of State and the Accountability Review Board, ensuring that the second objective is being achieved.\xc2\xa0 He is also following through on that second objective by calling on Congress, as you heard him say recently, to ensure that there is funding available to upgrade our security at our diplomatic facilities around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it his preference or his direction that the investigation and that justice be brought through the civilian courts?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will tell you simply that when we succeed in capturing suspected terrorists who pose a threat to the American people, our other critical national security objective is to maintain a viable authority to keep those individuals behind bars.\xc2\xa0 The strong preference of this administration is to accomplish that through prosecution either in an Article 3 court or a reformed military commission.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith regards to the disposition of this specific investigation, to the progress being made, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to refer you to the FBI.\xc2\xa0 But that has been our position.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Happy birthday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 This is how I chose to spend it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lucky you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know what -- I agree with that sentiment.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On immigration.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the President released a statement saying that the immigration bill that passed out of committee reflected his principles, but that he hoped it would be improved in the amendment process.\xc2\xa0 What improvements is he looking for?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I think he has said all along is that he had some bottom-line principles that were articulated in the proposals that were put forward online and presented to you and the public that have guided what he has said about immigration reform, comprehensive immigration reform, throughout this process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd he has said and he made clear in that statement again last night that the measure that passed out of committee last night with a bipartisan vote does reflect those principles.\xc2\xa0 He has also said that he does not expect that in a bipartisan process that is dealing with a matter of the magnitude of comprehensive immigration reform, that he is going to get everything exactly as he would write it.\xc2\xa0 And he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that anyone in this process will feel, when it\xe2\x80\x99s over, that he or she has gotten everything that he or she wanted, or that the bill emerges exactly as they would have written it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut he will, of course, as we work with Congress, as this process moves forward, work to have the bill reflect as closely as possible what he believes are important objectives.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you be specific about what else he would like in terms of improvement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are some issues -- I mean, I think you know that he supported the -- that he supports an amendment regarding the rights of LGBT individuals, and he made that clear I think in answer to a question he took on his trip to Latin America.\xc2\xa0 And this is not limited to that specific issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99d like that back in?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear that he supports that and would like to see Congress support that.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also made clear that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to get everything he wants in this bill.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean he won\xe2\x80\x99t fight for everything he wants, but he understands that compromise means not getting every single thing that you want.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the process cleared a significant hurdle last night and, in an otherwise busy news environment, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that a major objective, a major bipartisan objective, has been making significant progress in the Senate as well as the House, and cleared that significant hurdle last night.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s more work to be done, to be sure.\xc2\xa0 We are not there yet, but that is something that the President believes needs to be noted, that the senators responsible for that progress need to be commended for, and that serves as a useful reminder of the fact that we are capable here in Washington when we focus, when we work together, when we accept that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get everything we want, and if we want to achieve something in a bipartisan way, we can do big things.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve done it before.\xc2\xa0 And last night\xe2\x80\x99s success coming out of committee demonstrates that we can do it again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick follow-up on the IRS.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot in the briefing room about Kathy Ruemmler and how people were informed.\xc2\xa0 Can you say how many people on the senior staff were included when she informed people?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I want to say in response to I think Hans and some other questions here, we have endeavored to provide a great deal of information to you very quickly.\xc2\xa0 And in a situation like this, we face a choice that when we have a ton of incoming questions, legitimate questions, you guys are doing your job, as I said in answer to a question from Mark I believe last week.\xc2\xa0 This kind of environment when there are a lot of news stories, there are a lot of legitimate questions out there, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of our democracy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a great part of our democracy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the approach we take is we get the information to you that we have as soon as we can.\xc2\xa0 And we try to get that information to you as quickly as possible and as comprehensively as possible.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, quickly and comprehensively are not objectives that always meet.\xc2\xa0 And our approach is we get the information we have to you, and as we get more information, we fill in the details.\xc2\xa0 And if it turns out that the information that -- new information we have requires a correction, we do that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I did on Monday when it came to the so-called timeline.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo you guys -- we have a team here that works really hard at trying to anticipate the questions you\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask.\xc2\xa0 The problem is there are a lot of you, and you\'re good at your jobs and you\xe2\x80\x99re smart.\xc2\xa0 And we almost invariably do not anticipate every question that you ask.\xc2\xa0 So sometimes, we don\'t have the answers, and sometimes we need to go back and get them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut overall in this effort, I think that what the information we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided to you shows is that in response to the notification that people received about the pending completion of an independent Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s review of inappropriate activity by IRS personnel, a decision here was made to wait until that report was finished before any action or any comment was made.\xc2\xa0 Because the cardinal rule here, even though it can be inconvenient from a communications point of view or even a political point of view, is that you don\'t intervene.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t prejudge.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t use the weight of this podium or this building or the presidency to get ahead of the kind of independent investigation that this particular IG audit represents, or in the case of some other matters we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked here about, criminal investigations that take place under the aegis of the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But without filling in details, my question was can you tell us --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, no, and I just wanted to say that because I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been some legitimate criticisms about how we\xe2\x80\x99re handling this, and I say legitimate because I mean it.\xc2\xa0 But we are endeavoring to pursue those two objectives.\xc2\xa0 In an environment that really never has existed before in terms of the speed and information flow, the rapidity with which information is conveyed and then released, we are working to get you everything we can as quickly as we can and as comprehensively as we can.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the alternative, of course, is to -- and it may be a better approach -- you and others can decide -- is to then say, look, I can\'t answer any of these questions until later.\xc2\xa0 And then we can spend all our time trying to get everything that we know, that we can find, and then waiting sometimes hours, days.\xc2\xa0 But the demands of the news environment make that very difficult. So we take the path we\'ve taken and accept that it\xe2\x80\x99s got some potholes in it and diversions that aren\'t always enjoyable.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHaving said that, in answer to your question, here\xe2\x80\x99s what I can tell you.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there was an initial communication to a lower-level person in the White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s office through email just as part of a number of updates on the status of a number of Inspector General matters that included reference to this Inspector General audit coming to conclusion.\xc2\xa0 That was, I believe -- whatever I said -- April 16th.\xc2\xa0 But the White House Counsel herself did not find out until April 24th.\xc2\xa0 She then notified some members -- but not all -- some members of senior staff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI can\'t tell you because -- she notified some -- I can\'t account for every conversation that might have been had outside the White House Mess.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t tell you how many people knew.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is she alerted the Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief of Staff; obviously, others in her office knew.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd from everything we\'ve gathered and all the evidence shows -- whether it was April 16th or April 24th or May 10th, when the news broke, our approach to this has been the same, which is that we should not do anything, we should not act on this information until the report is finished, the independent Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s audit is completed.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the approach we took.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s been criticism of that.\xc2\xa0 I think it was the right call, personally.\xc2\xa0 But obviously others have different opinions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we appreciate your respect for the free press.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s sincere.\xc2\xa0 I think you know that.\xc2\xa0 But go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In that spirit, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s quest for balance between freedom of the press and prosecution of potential criminal leaks, and in the interest of transparency, would he ask his Justice Department to release the names of all reporters and all news organizations whose phone records have been subpoenaed, who are currently being monitored, or who are in any way being investigated as a part of any potential leaks investigation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very interesting question and -- (laughter) -- no, seriously.\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s the challenge it presents, is that that would be -- the action you\'re suggesting any President might take would be to actively involve himself or herself, any President, in an ongoing criminal investigation.\xc2\xa0 And the consequences of doing that are potentially enormous.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult, when you talk about ongoing activity, to suggest that the White House or the President should intervene or take action.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat I can tell you is what I told you yesterday, and that is that the President -- that I\'ve spoken with the President about this issue and I\'ve spoken to him about it generally in terms of his views on press freedoms, the First Amendment, the need for journalists to do their jobs, and on the question that I think I had been asked on an earlier day with regard to one of these specific cases but then extracted not to have -- so that it did not pertain to a specific case, should -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that if you were to ask him should a reporter ever be prosecuted for doing his or her job, the answer in his view is no.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut there\xe2\x80\x99s also a balance here, and I think that everyone involved in these cases who has thought about it and written about it in a thoughtful way, or talked about it on television in a thoughtful way, recognizes that there are real issues here when we talk about our secrets.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned the other day, if there were no consequences to divulging highly sensitive classified information, then we might as well not have it.\xc2\xa0 We might as well not have secrets.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s an extreme -- no consequences.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, but --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So there has to be a mechanism by which we ensure that national security information that is highly sensitive, the divulgence of which could have enormous and detrimental consequences, is protected.\xc2\xa0 And there has to be an enforcement mechanism to that.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I know that\xe2\x80\x99s this President\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xc2\xa0 I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s been the view of his predecessors.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt is also his view that we need to ensure that reporters are able to conduct investigative journalism freely and that they are not prosecuted for doing their job.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, again, broadly speaking, not commenting on specific cases because I cannot and should not, that there are procedures in place that deal with this issue, as I understand it, and there should be more done, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he supports a media shield law.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he thinks, as I said yesterday, that this conversation is important to have and that the broader discussion is important to have, and that the questions surrounding these issues are legitimate and that this is one of these issues that he believes should be discussed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you just stated the President\xe2\x80\x99s preference that no reporter should be prosecuted for doing their job.\xc2\xa0 So would it be the President\xe2\x80\x99s preference -- not intervening -- but would it be the President\xe2\x80\x99s preference that the Justice Department release the names of news organizations and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a direction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I understand, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a smart way to ask the question, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t suggest that the President would, as a matter of preference or action, intervene.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How can reporters do their jobs if they don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether they\xe2\x80\x99re being investigated while they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it?\xc2\xa0 How can they fairly ask people to share information if these people are going to lose their jobs, their livelihood?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, the second part of your question -- look, I think that any of us who works for the federal government and who has been cleared for access to classified information is -- we have a public trust not to violate and divulge that classified information.\xc2\xa0 And a decision to do that is a decision that should carry consequences.\xc2\xa0 I think most Americans would --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should reporters not know if they\xe2\x80\x99re being monitored?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I believe and I know the President believes that there needs to be adequate provisions in the law that allow for the press to operate freely, and that is reflected in his support for the media shield law.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in what he has said.\xc2\xa0 It is also the case, Jessica, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to be expansive about in a way that pushes right up against the line here, that he believes that this discussion is important to have and he believes that the questions being asked now are worth asking.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMr. Karl.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Happy birthday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I appreciate fully your point about not being able to interfere with an investigation.\xc2\xa0 I just want to try to understand the limits of presidential power in this case.\xc2\xa0 The President would prefer that reporters not be prosecuted for doing its job --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is his view that reporters should not be prosecuted.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 And if he knew that such a thing was going on with the Justice Department, if there were cases that went over that line, would he have any power to intervene, or would the fact that those were ongoing investigations mean that he would --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of, I mean, again, based on publicly available information, that any reporter has been or is being prosecuted.\xc2\xa0 But what I would say is that of course he could not or should not intervene directly in such a hypothetical case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President can set policy for his administration and he can have policy discussions with his administration and with Congress, especially if policy considerations require legislation.\xc2\xa0 He has done that and he will do that.\xc2\xa0 But the hypothetical you set up, I think the answer to that is, no, because it would be inappropriate to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even if those prosecutors in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view were abusing that power that they have?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical that isn\xe2\x80\x99t really germane to what we know now.\xc2\xa0 And he obviously believes that investigations ought to be conducted properly, that rules and procedures ought to be followed, and in general, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, believes that the press needs to be accorded significant freedom in doing its job.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on the IRS, is the President comfortable -- I know there\xe2\x80\x99s still this 30-day review that\xe2\x80\x99s just starting, there\xe2\x80\x99s still a criminal investigation -- but does he feel that knowing what we know now, the right people have been held accountable at the IRS?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 He believes that we need to find all the facts.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that we know what all those facts are yet, but he believes that the Inspector General, the independent Inspector General, conducted an audit, identified clearly that inappropriate activity was taking place that was wrong and that should not have happened regardless of the motivation.\xc2\xa0 And he believes -- and that is why he has insisted that what\xe2\x80\x99s taking place take place, that the 30-day top-down review be instituted.\xc2\xa0 He believes that we need to find out who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for the failures at the IRS and to hold them accountable, but we need to get the facts before we make judgments about who is accountable. But he\xe2\x80\x99s insisting that that take place and that this move expeditiously.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tConcurrently, as we speak, there is congressional oversight being undertaken.\xc2\xa0 There are senior administration officials participating in that congressional oversight.\xc2\xa0 We will cooperate with all legitimate congressional oversight, as we have in the past.\xc2\xa0 And we think that\'s entirely appropriate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe also note that the Attorney General has announced a criminal investigation into this matter.\xc2\xa0 So I think that folks out in the country can look at the response from both the congressional and executive branches of government here and at least recognize that there is a united sense of seriousness about this problem and the need to find out what happened, to hold people accountable, and to put in place measures that ensure it doesn\'t happen again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\'t think Republicans are politicizing this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Look, as I said yesterday -- and I want to be clear because I think some of it got -- like my first answer to Major was reported and then not the second answer, which is:\xc2\xa0 Let me be clear, the President believes the activity here, the actions here were wrong and inappropriate.\xc2\xa0 He wants to get to the bottom of it.\xc2\xa0 He wants people held responsible if they are responsible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think it\xe2\x80\x99s also clear, as others have reported, that there has been some attempt to politicize this.\xc2\xa0 I think that generally speaking, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, congressional oversight from both parties is wholly appropriate.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s been some analogies thrown out and some other characterizations made, some accusations that are unfounded, that are backed up by zero evidence, that I think represents some attempts to politicize this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut that is not to -- making that observation in this case is not to dismiss the severity of what we know, based on the IG report.\xc2\xa0 And the President, as I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard and seen, is not happy about it and he wants action taken.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMajor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Mr. Shulman said in testimony today, when asked about his many visits to the White House -- White House logs have him coming about 118 times in 2011 -- did he discuss the ongoing situation with the IRS with anyone here at the White House, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNot to my memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Have you, here in the White House, asked everyone who might have been involved if there was any conversations anyone in this building had with anyone at the IRS in the relevant years about this pending matter?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have, obviously, seen what you just reported -- that former Commissioner Shulman in sworn testimony says that he does not -- he did not, to his recollection, talk to anyone at the White House about the handling of 501(c)(4) applications, and I certainly have no information to the contrary that would contradict that.\xc2\xa0 I think he was also asked if he had been directed to have the IRS participate in this activity and he said no.\xc2\xa0 And I obviously have no information to contradict that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAn IRS commissioner appropriately has -- or his designees has meetings on matters of policy all the time but not discussions about enforcement or applications for tax exempt status.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I have absolutely zero evidence to suggest that he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong in that assertion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in your process here in the White House, as you gather information, have you asked that question of everyone in the senior staff?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can tell you -- and I think I would point you to my explanation for how we are trying to answer all the legitimate questions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked here -- that I certainly have no evidence to the contrary finding the absence or finding -- proving a negative can be difficult, obviously, but he has testified to that effect.\xc2\xa0 The IG, the Inspector General himself said that in his audit he found no indication, no evidence of --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask anybody here at the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know, but for the people who -- for the activity itself, he said that there was no evidence of outside influence or pressure from higher-ups.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s his finding, independent Inspector General.\xc2\xa0 There is additional investigating being done by Congress, by the Department of Justice, by the IRS.\xc2\xa0 But I have no -- we have no information that contradicts what former Commissioner Shulman has testified to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the testimony of Mr. Shulman, Stephen Lynch, a Democrat from Massachusetts, was expressing some frustration about the inability to get answers not only related to that, but to Lois Lerner.\xc2\xa0 And he said if we can\xe2\x80\x99t get answers, this inevitably will lead to calls not just from Republicans but from Democrats for a special prosecutor.\xc2\xa0 And the President said last week he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.\xc2\xa0 Is that the permanent position of the White House that it will never be necessary?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 What I would say is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In this matter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we intend to get answers.\xc2\xa0 We intend to get answers.\xc2\xa0 The President insists that we get answers.\xc2\xa0 Congress rightly insists that we get answers.\xc2\xa0 I expect -- independent criminal investigations, so I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had this conversation -- but I expect that the Attorney General and those who will work on the investigation at the Department of Justice expect to get answers.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think you have a 30-day top-down review at the IRS with new leadership.\xc2\xa0 You have congressional oversight.\xc2\xa0 You have Department of Justice investigating.\xc2\xa0 I think that demonstrates the seriousness that both branches of government are -- the seriousness with which both branches of government here are addressing this matter.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think that there\xe2\x80\x99s any indication given that seriousness, given that determination, to get to the bottom of this, to get the facts and to hold people accountable, that there\xe2\x80\x99s any reason to take that step.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view as he said last week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President revisit that if Congress proves incapable or frustrated with its ability to get answers?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major, I would simply say that he expects results.\xc2\xa0 He expects answers.\xc2\xa0 And he has put in place a process that will hopefully fulfill that objective.\xc2\xa0 There is another process in Congress that we are cooperating with that we believe should have that as its objective, and there is a separate criminal investigation undertaken by the Department of Justice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before I let you go, there\xe2\x80\x99s a report in Germany today.\xc2\xa0 The German intelligence now has completely reassessed --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so when I said that there are sometimes questions we do not anticipate, I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure this is one of them.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, just an assessment of Syria and the civil war.\xc2\xa0 And its assessment is that Assad is in a much better position, and that his armed forces have inflicted considerable losses on the rebels; that their own disorganization, which is well understood, is increasingly a problem, and they now predict that Assad is more than likely to hold on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTwo questions:\xc2\xa0 Would you and this government disagree with that assessment, that Assad is in a stronger position than he was, say, six months or twelve months ago?\xc2\xa0 And even if you don\'t agree with that, is there a question now about the efficacy of the entire U.S. policy there if, in fact, Assad is able to hold on?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have not seen the German assessment that you referred to, and I don\'t know whether it is our assessment that Assad is stronger now than he was a month ago or six months ago or weaker.\xc2\xa0 I mean, clearly, he is significantly weaker than he was two years ago.\xc2\xa0 And in that time, the opposition has gotten significantly more organized.\xc2\xa0 It has received assistance from a variety of places, including from the United States.\xc2\xa0 And our efforts to assist the opposition, working with our partners and allies, continue.\xc2\xa0 Our efforts with the international community to -- and with the opposition -- towards implementing the Geneva Communiqu\xc3\xa9 continue, because we believe that ultimately there has to be a political transition, and that the sooner that process begins the better, and that that process has to result in a post-Assad Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere is no question that Bashar al-Assad continues to butcher his own people, to take brutal actions as he clings onto power.\xc2\xa0 And there is no question, as I talked about yesterday, that Hezbollah, for example, is assisting him in that effort.\xc2\xa0 And I think that demonstrates the kinds of friends that Bashar al-Assad has in the world.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve made clear our views on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat is why we have stepped up our assistance.\xc2\xa0 That is why we have stepped up our humanitarian aid.\xc2\xa0 That is why we have stepped up our efforts to bring about a political transition.\xc2\xa0 But no question this is a difficult situation and that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s relevant because one of the decisions before the President is whether to step up the movement of arms to the rebels.\xc2\xa0 And if they\xe2\x80\x99re losing, there are vast policy implications to the U.S. government to make that decision.\xc2\xa0 If they think they\xe2\x80\x99re going to lose, why would you make that decision in the first place?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s relevant, it seems --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that\'s -- look, this is a difficult challenge, and I think your question is excellent.\xc2\xa0 I do not know if it is the assessment -- if the assessment that the opposition is losing is one we share.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that that\'s the case.\xc2\xa0 But it is definitely a brutal environment there and Assad continues to cling onto power.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen we review our options and when the President reviews our options, and he reviews all options, including the question of whether or not to provide lethal assistance to the opposition, we have to look at all the factors.\xc2\xa0 We constantly review that option.\xc2\xa0 To this point, we have made the policy judgment that that is not the right course to take.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we\'ve had really interesting discussions in this room and elsewhere about that you have to look at the potential consequences of making a choice like that, and make sure that if you were to make a choice like that, that you were doing it in a way that helped bring about the policy objective you seek, because this is a very fraught business, as you know.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about composition of the opposition and the need to examine that.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve talked about whether introducing more arms into an incredibly violent situation will, in fact, help bring about the political transition that the Syrian people deserve.\xc2\xa0 We look at that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhich is not to say that this option doesn\xe2\x80\x99t remain on the table; it absolutely does.\xc2\xa0 But I think that the approach that we have taken has been one that has always looked at the potential consequences of these kinds of policy decisions.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we have stepped up our aid, have provided aid directly to the opposition, directly to the Supreme Military Council, but why we have made the decision about what we\xe2\x80\x99re not providing to this point that we have made.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThank you, Major.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back on Justice, since you say the President feels so strongly about the press freedoms, why not take a more specific action, write a letter to the Attorney General from the President saying, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to interfere with criminal investigations, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into individual details, but my principle, the principle of this administration is we should not be surveilling reporters, we should be protecting their rights?\xc2\xa0 Why can\'t he put that in writing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, what you said is not specifically what I annunciated yesterday in terms of -- there is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Reporters should not be prosecuted for doing their jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, okay.\xc2\xa0 I did say that, and speaking for him I said that; reflecting actually a direct conversation I had with him, I said that.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that since the President believes this is a conversation worth having, and he believes that these are legitimate questions and that if we remove them from the specifics of this case so that he can talk about them, he believes that he would participate in that conversation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I don\'t have any -- I don\'t have --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s the President and he believes this, and yet this is going on in his own administration.\xc2\xa0 And it appears --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you have to be careful about what \xe2\x80\x9cthis\xe2\x80\x9d means, okay?\xc2\xa0 And we have --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The New Yorker is reporting that it was more than just James Rosen\xe2\x80\x99s phones that were being looked at by the government.\xc2\xa0 So the President says one thing, his administration appears to be doing something else.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I don\'t think that\'s the case.\xc2\xa0 Again, I can\'t specify -- speak to a specific criminal investigation.\xc2\xa0 I can speak to the fact that publicly available information has indicated that that particular investigation is over, and that charges related to that investigation that will be brought have already been brought.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s that.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\'s commenting on publicly available information.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMore broadly, I think that we can\'t comment on the specifics of an ongoing criminal investigation.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the other matter that was discussed a lot last week and earlier this week, and appropriately so.\xc2\xa0 Because as I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from these public reports, published reports and others, one of the issues here is that when there are leak investigations, investigations of the improper disclosure of classified information tends to mean an investigation at least in part into some portion of an administration.\xc2\xa0 So of course, the White House cannot or should not -- the President cannot or should not insert himself or itself into that process because that would at the very least create the appearance of interfering.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the President does believe that broader discussion needs to be held.\xc2\xa0 He does believe that there are important policy issues here.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s made that clear in his views on legislation, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he looks forward to having that conversation in the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the IRS, the President said he was outraged last week by the IRS scandal.\xc2\xa0 Is he outraged then that Lois Lerner is taking the Fifth since you\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly that he wants answers?\xc2\xa0 Is he outraged that she\xe2\x80\x99s taking the Fifth?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak to any individual\xe2\x80\x99s decision about how they\xe2\x80\x99ll approach congressional hearings.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the President will not be deterred in the effort to find what happened here and who is responsible.\xc2\xa0 He does not expect that Congress will be deterred in its pursuit of what happened here and finding out who was responsible, and insisting that those responsible be held accountable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe does not expect -- again, independent and criminal investigation -- but he does not expect and nor do I that the Justice Department would be deterred in pursuit of finding out that information.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President has made clear what he thinks needs to happen here.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s made clear how seriously he views this misconduct.\xc2\xa0 And he has put in place a process at the IRS that will, as its purpose, gather more information and more facts to find out who is responsible and to ensure that they\'re held accountable, and to ensure that procedures are put in place so that it doesn\'t happen again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we are and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to cooperate with congressional oversight into this matter and with any investigation that the Justice Department might be engaged in.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you say the President wants to hold people accountable in this scandal.\xc2\xa0 Why then is Lois Lerner still working at the IRS today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to find the facts before you hold people accountable.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President through Secretary Lew has instructed a new acting commissioner on the job today to institute a 30-day review.\xc2\xa0 We have, as our starting point, the Inspector General\xe2\x80\x99s audit clearly identifies improper conduct, the improper targeting of specific conservative groups in the application process for nonprofit status -- clearly inappropriate.\xc2\xa0 And now we need to find out who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible.\xc2\xa0 We need to be clear about those facts, and then we need to take action to make sure that those people are held accountable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing on -- you mentioned immigration, making some progress.\xc2\xa0 Other second-term items for the President have not made progress -- gun control, a budget deal.\xc2\xa0 A bit frustrated by those, but he is making progress on immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 Is there any frustration here inside the White House that he\xe2\x80\x99s making progress on this big item, it\xe2\x80\x99s being overshadowed by the IRS, by the questions about some of these other stories?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that we absolutely recognize that the IRS issue is significant and deserves attention.\xc2\xa0 We absolutely understand that some of the reporting on what are apparently criminal investigations are of interest, and in particular interest to reporters, and absolutely valid questions about that, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s an environment that\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate and we understand.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what he has made clear to all of us who work for him here and who work for the American people here is that there\xe2\x80\x99s an agenda that the American people expect us to act on.\xc2\xa0 And in the case of comprehensive immigration reform, that has become, rather rapidly, a bipartisan objective.\xc2\xa0 And that is a good thing.\xc2\xa0 And I think it demonstrates that even in this environment, which at times can be fractious and partisan, that there is the potential for significant progress on a difficult issue in a bipartisan manner, and the President believes that those senators and also those House members who have worked on this issue -- Democrats and Republicans -- and worked with the objective of reaching a deal and a compromise should be commended; and that, amidst everything else, they should be lifted up and pointed to as individuals who are making an effort -- as is the President -- to find compromise on the kinds of issues that only move forward if there\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan cooperation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPeter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For our bookkeeping purposes, if today is the first day of the 30-day review --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For your -- what did you say?\xc2\xa0 Booking purposes?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bookkeeping purposes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, bookkeeping.\xc2\xa0 I thought you wanted to book an interview for 30 days from now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it -- why don\xe2\x80\x99t we do that as well if you want to.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But is it 30 days from now?\xc2\xa0 And can you set a date by which the President is expecting to have the results or that you guys want to hear the results of this review?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, full transparency -- the President, through the Secretary of Treasury, has insisted that the new acting commissioner conduct this top-down 30-day review.\xc2\xa0 It is a fact that today is his first day on the job.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that that clock starts ticking today.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you, obviously, to IRS and Treasury for their specific timeline within that 30 days and what they expect the end day to be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut as far as the President is concerned, Danny Werfel, the new acting commissioner, who is enormously qualified and has experience under administrations of both parties on these matters, is getting to work today and ought to make this his top priority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On separate topics -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a U.N. Nuclear Agency report today that says that Iran has increased its capacity to refine uranium by installing hundreds more centrifuges.\xc2\xa0 I just was hoping to get the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that news.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that I don\'t have more specific information on that except to say that we\'re reviewing the IAEA Director General\xe2\x80\x99s report and we will discuss how best to respond to it with other members of the board.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re currently reviewing the report.\xc2\xa0 It is just released, as you said.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn this matter, the fact that Iran is engaged in continued pursuit of nuclear weapons is clear.\xc2\xa0 We have worked assiduously with our international partners, as well as unilaterally to hold them accountable for their refusal to abide by their international commitments with regards to their nuclear ambitions.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have instituted the most stringent sanctions regime in history, a regime that has had a dramatic impact on Iran, that has made clear that there is a significant cost to their flouting of their international obligations.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- hundreds more -- that\'s why I posed the question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'re reviewing this report and will have a comment on it.\xc2\xa0 We believe, and we are engaged in a process that we know that there is still time for Iran to make this decision to choose to abide by its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with the P5-plus-1, which put forward a substantial offer in Almaty to bring that about.\xc2\xa0 And now it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the Iranians to respond substantively to that proposal and to address the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about the nature of its nuclear program.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another headline made news today that an Army sergeant first class at West Point Military Academy has been accused of planting hidden cameras in the shower in locker room facilities of female cadets.\xc2\xa0 Given what we heard recently from the President in terms of his referring to those who commit these crimes as unpatriotic and the like, how involved is he in knowing about the specifics of individual events, as there\xe2\x80\x99s now been a consistent line of new headlines from around the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know about the specific report.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President is very focused on this.\xc2\xa0 And you heard him -- I think it was in the East Room when he addressed this -- make very clear that he has zero tolerance for sexual assault in the military and that he believes that those who participate in it dishonor the uniform they wear, and that those who are victims of it and who wear the uniform should know that the Commander-in-Chief has their backs.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd he is insisting that action be taken.\xc2\xa0 He has met with Secretary Hagel about this.\xc2\xa0 You have heard Secretary Hagel address this.\xc2\xa0 This is a very serious matter.\xc2\xa0 And he finds it unconscionable and there has to be action taken.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just finally, if you can -- what can you tell us right now about what we can anticipate in terms of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s National Defense University speech on counterterrorism?\xc2\xa0 Is there any new guidance you can offer us?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I went through yesterday what sort of topic areas that you can expect the President to discuss.\xc2\xa0 I think these are weighty, substantive matters.\xc2\xa0 This is a speech that he has looked forward to giving.\xc2\xa0 It is one that he telegraphed in his State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 These are matters that, in some ways, similarly to the subject we were just discussing, he believes are subject to legitimate questions and that these are issue areas that he believes we need to be as transparent as possible about.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that reflected in his remarks tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from him tomorrow then about what his plans are going forward.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m curious, now five years in after the President\xe2\x80\x99s pledge, before he came into office, that he would close Guantanamo Bay what he blames for that not having occurred to this point.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Congress has been an obstacle in this as well, but one of the things this administration did was shut down the office -- the special envoy who was in charge of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and I\'m curious if that action has in some way contributed to this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I clearly don\'t think that\'s an action that\'s contributed to the fact that Guantanamo Bay is still open and I think the President -- you will hear the President discuss this subject, and I don\'t want to get ahead of the specifics.\xc2\xa0 But it is the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that we should be determined, as he is, to see the Guantanamo Bay detention facility closed.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKeeping it open is not efficient, it\xe2\x80\x99s not effective, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the interests of our national security.\xc2\xa0 And I think senior members of the military have testified to that fact.\xc2\xa0 Senior members of sort of the broader national security apparatus of both parties have expressed that opinion.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor has expressed that opinion.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s opponent in the 2008 election, Senator McCain, has expressed that opinion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe fact is Congress has enacted and renewed legislation in order to foreclose our ability to close the detention facility.\xc2\xa0 The legislation restricts our experienced counterterrorism professionals from exercising their best judgment as to what the most appropriate disposition is of the individuals still held there.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President is considering a range of options for ways that we can reduce the population there and move toward ultimate closure, some of which we can take on our own, but some of which will require working with the Congress, which we hope will engage more productively on this process in the future than it has in the past.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd to your point, I would say that one of the options is reappointing a senior official at the State Department to renew our focus on repatriating or transferring those detainees.\xc2\xa0 I would wait for the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks for a fuller view of this important issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s an option, but not an answer.\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of State is in the Middle East today and he is going to discuss the new effort to restart Israel-Palestine peace negotiation.\xc2\xa0 Is the Obama administration hopeful of Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s effort?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that his fourth-time trip will help to reduce (inaudible) between in both sides?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you saw from the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit, and the immediate follow-up by Secretary Kerry, and his follow-ups thereafter that we are focused on this issue, and that we are looking for progress from both sides.\xc2\xa0 And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize our level of optimism, because this is a difficult and challenging issue and has been for decades.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we believe that there is an opportunity to move forward in the peace process, and it requires both sides to be willing to negotiate directly on the issues that remain unresolved.\xc2\xa0 And we are engaging in that process, but it certainly requires both sides to be willing to engage as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to immigration reform. Senator Leahy yesterday withheld amendments that would have included gay couples as part of a larger package.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the Associated Press reported that the White House had asked him to hold off on those measures.\xc2\xa0 Did the White House, in fact, ask Senator Leahy to revoke those amendments?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President address this issue -- I think it was in an interview in Costa Rica.\xc2\xa0 I think the President supports that amendment, and he also made clear that he knows he won\xe2\x80\x99t get everything, necessarily, that he wants in the final comprehensive immigration bill that he hopes the Senate will pass and the House will pass and will arrive on his desk.\xc2\xa0 But he will push for those things that he believes ought to be in it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we make sure that everyone who\xe2\x80\x99s engaged in this process understands that they may not get everything they want, but I think he expressed very clearly his strong support for that amendment.\xc2\xa0 He would hope that if it comes up again that there would be strong bipartisan support for it -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see.\xc2\xa0 But his support I think he expressed very clearly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the President supports that amendment, but that response doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really get to the issue of whether the White House asked Senator Leahy to pull out --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I think you saw the manner in which it was discussed in the hearing by Senator Leahy, who introduced it, and other members of the committee who discussed it.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously engaged in conversations with the main players on this issue on a regular basis.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t have the contents of all those conversations.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the President supports --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\'t deny it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t deny the report.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that conversation.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is the President supports the amendment.\xc2\xa0 The President also believes, as he made clear in Costa Rica, that we need to accept that we may not get everything we want.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t mean we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to fight for the things that we believe in, and this President will.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During the markup last week, it was like one Democrat after the other was -- Senator Feinstein, Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer said they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring themselves to support the measure.\xc2\xa0 And these are senators from the President\xe2\x80\x99s own party.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a reasonable expectation that the President should have worked to bring them on board in time for that vote in accordance with decisions -- in accordance with the decision for immigration reform?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think each senator expressed himself or herself and his or her own views, so I would refer you to them.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s views are clear.\xc2\xa0 He believes this amendment should be passed and has made his views clear on that.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak for other senators.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President\xe2\x80\x99s support of the media shield law acknowledge any existing problems with media protections or any potential abuse of power that this administration or another administration might use?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I would say is the President believes we need a media shield law because we need added protections reflected in the media shield law.\xc2\xa0 And I would note that the negotiated bill from 2009 had the support of media organizations and prosecutors, and that reflects I think the balance that the President seeks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that the media shield law if it were to pass tomorrow and be signed into law next week would end the discussion or would solve the challenges that this issue represents and contains within it, but he does believe that more needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he has long supported a media shield law.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he trace the need for the law to the Patriot Act?\xc2\xa0 Does he trace it to something more ontological with press freedoms?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I confess that it would probably be more fruitful if you look back at the statements he made as a senator when he supported a media shield law, which obviously was prior to his administration, and to the statements that he and his administration made when this matter was up before the Senate in 2009 in terms of the origins of his concerns.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And about the speech tomorrow, Jay, on the promise that the President made in the State of the Union on drones, does the President feel like he has been as transparent as he has promised to be since then in the intervening months?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the issue of drones?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, targeted killings.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have in a variety of forums, through senior members of the administration -- from the President to the Attorney General to John Brennan and others -- provided a substantial amount of information and had a number of substantive discussions about this issue.\xc2\xa0 The President made clear that he wants to expand that even further, that he believes that we need to be as transparent about a matter like this as we can, understanding that there are national security implications to this issue and to the broader issues involved in counterterrorism policy.\xc2\xa0 That is why he is delivering this speech tomorrow, which will encompass a number of issues, including some of the specifics around counterterrorism execution and policy, as you described, also Guantanamo Bay and other issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut this is a matter that, as I said before and as the President has said, he thinks is an absolutely valid and legitimate and important area of discussion and debate and conversation, and that it is his belief that there need to be structures in place that remain in place for successive administrations so that in the carrying out of counterterrorism policy, procedures are followed that allow it to be conducted in a way that ensures that we\xe2\x80\x99re keeping with our traditions and our laws.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President set the bar very high.\xc2\xa0 Has he met his own bar?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, if you ask the President, I think he has endeavored to meet that bar in keeping with the fact that he believes more information rightfully should be disclosed, he\xe2\x80\x99s giving a speech tomorrow about it.\xc2\xa0 And I hope everybody settles in -- I expect it will not be brief.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Happy birthday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, April.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\xc2\xa0 On the matter of the IRS and this whole other issue, has the President been updated on the delay in the federal tax refunds?\xc2\xa0 Has he been told as to if the delay has ceased the refunds going out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that question so I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take it and get back to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he made aware of the delay in the tax refunds?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He may have been, April.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you have a comment on this terror attack in London and whether the President has spoken to Cameron?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you on it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, all, very much.\xc2\xa0 Appreciate it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:28 P.M.
