GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 One quick announcement before we get going.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow the President and the First Lady will travel to Wilmington, Delaware, to attend the funeral of Jean Biden.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have details on press access for tomorrow\'s travel a little bit later in the day, but I just wanted to mention that.</p>\n<p>Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 On health care, would the President sign a bill that did not include the tax on the so-called Cadillac health care plans, or is that a mandatory revenue-producing for him at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, the President will meet with some of the organized labor community this afternoon to discuss health care and presumably to get into that topic, and we\'ll have more of a readout when we get done with that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, how would you say -- how would you characterize his stance at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, he supported the Senate bill and that provision was in that bill for what it does in terms of changing the direction of health care costs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\'s his message to a constituency represented by the labor leaders today that clearly are opposed to this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that will be happening in the meeting and when that meeting is over we\'ll have a chance to talk about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he confident about winning them over?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll tell you that after the meeting as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, there were a lot of reports out this morning that the administration is considering a fee on banks, and I was wondering if you can talk about that -- what you\'re thinking of in that regard?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have specifics to talk about what will be in the budget.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll do that certainly later in the month as we get closer to the budget.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say, Caren, that the President has talked on a number of occasions about ensuring that the money that taxpayers put up to rescue our financial system is paid back in full.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been the President\'s position.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the least that taxpayers are owed.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll have more details on budgetary stuff as we get closer to the budget being released.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we see something specific in the budget that ensures that taxpayers are paid back in full?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s the President\'s goal, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And just to follow up on that, you got a lot of questions last week about Secretary Geithner.\xc2\xa0 And one of the main criticisms there is that he\'s too close to Wall Street and the administration is too close to Wall Street, and I just was wondering what your response to that is.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President made a series of decisions with his economic team on what had to be done to stabilize our economic situation upon taking office -- an economic situation that veered quite honestly -- not simply the worst recession since the Great Depression, but an economy that quite frankly teetered on the edge of larger collapse.</p>\n<p>The President has made a series of decisions to take steps to get our economy jumpstarted on a path toward recovery.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at what people on Wall Street say about some of our -- either our economic decisions or our economic rhetoric, I think that alone disproves that this is all about Wall Street.</p>\n<p>Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the middle of December, OMB put out a memo to all federal agencies about how to calculate the stimulus, how to calculate jobs created and saved, saying that, among other things, that there would be quarterly instead of -- updated more frequently than that, and that also that if somebody were paid even -- two employees of a library who were already working there are paid with stimulus dollars, those two individuals should -- that should count as jobs created by or saved by the stimulus, even if those jobs existed already.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any further explanation about why --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I haven\'t seen the memo but I\'m happy to talk to them and put you in touch with them.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen the memo and don\'t know what the details are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 To follow up on a question I asked last week about the freeing of Qais Khazaali, do you have any more on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then -- all right, that\'s it, I\'m done.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Get back to me when you can.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Harry Reid, the President put out the statement over the weekend accepting his apology, and I\'m wondering why the President didn\'t talk in that apology, or in that conversation I guess that he had with him about unfortunate language that was used -- no mention of that at all.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President put out the statement or you put out the statement on behalf the President, this conversation that he had with Senator Reid, there was no mention at all about the unfortunate language that was used.\xc2\xa0 It was more --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that phrase was in the statement about the fact that -- the unfortunate choice of words by Senator Reid.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it didn\'t seem like he went into sort of anything more than just, I accept his apology and we move on from here.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything more that the President --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no -- I mean, I don\'t have the statement in front of me, but I think the President\'s statement said that Senator Reid had called him about these comments that the President called unfortunate; that he\'s worked with Senator Reid, he knows Senator Reid, the type of values that he has, the agenda that he\'s pushed in the U.S. Senate; and didn\'t take offense at them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President said anything more about that in light of just that what we\'ve been hearing, it\'s been dominating the various shows over the weekend and even this morning?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it wasn\'t something I\'ve heard the President talk more about today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the -- in light of what has happened with terrorism, the terrorism threat, is there anything at all that the administration had planned to do, maybe a second-tier priority, that has been put on the backburner now because there\'s been sort of the ramped-up efforts with terrorism, the attention, and so much of the air sucked out with terrorism at the end of the year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 You mean an agenda item that the President would be focused on -- focusing on that he\'s not because of the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything -- right, exactly.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything else that the President was planning --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dan, this question has sort of come in different forms throughout different times.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not the juggling or the are you handling too much question.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s just that is there anything that you said, listen, we weren\'t planning on spending so much time focused on terrorism at the beginning of the year.\xc2\xa0 Now we have to; there are some other things, some other priorities, that have to be put on the backburner.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t understand.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the juggling question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not saying are you -- I\'m not --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not trying to be sarcastic.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just trying to get -- I\'m lost with the premise of the question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not saying, are you juggling too much -- is it just realize, hey, you know, we have to focus so much on terrorism; let\'s put something else back a bit, let\'s move something off the front burner.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that is the juggling question, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s a balancing question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ahh, thanks for the crystal clear clarity of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not the typical question that says, are you guys --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know how I didn\'t get that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not saying are you guys juggling too much?\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the question.\xc2\xa0 The question is just have you decided to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying are we not doing something because we\'re doing something in lieu of that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But my question wasn\'t, are you juggling too much.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just asking you, is there anything you\'ve decided to put off for now because there are these other issues you weren\'t planning on spending so much time on?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe I should have just said no and gotten out.\xc2\xa0 The answer is no.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\'t you say that in the first place?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I did, and then I sought to understand the premise of the -- never mind.</p>\n<p>I would say this, Dan, that the notion that -- well, let me say this, I think inherent in your question is somehow now the President is having to spend so much more time on something like terrorism that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- that there wasn\'t spending time on that prior to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, you -- I understand you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, right.\xc2\xa0 And I would just say that, you know, again, the President\'s PDB goes over the security situation and threats.\xc2\xa0 The President has spent quite a great deal of time dealing with this.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s no issue that has not been discussed or worked on because of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything going on behind the scenes on immigration reform at all?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t remember if the President has had any meetings on this recently, but I can certainly go back and look through the schedule.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When is the President going to hold a news conference?\xc2\xa0 Not that you\'re not adequate.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Chip asked this question on Friday --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but she\'ll get an answer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, she is nicer than you, Chip.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\'s gone an obscenely long time, not holding one.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But again, not the word "adequate."\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>I don\'t see one on the schedule at least in the short term, which is precisely what I said --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he avoiding us?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, the last time we had this conversation here about the President\'s media strategy I was informed by many of you that the President was overexposed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\'t have a good reason for not holding one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who in this room said that the President was overexposed?\xc2\xa0 One person in this room that said he was overexposed.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, we had a whole round of questioning on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\'s take a vote.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Seriously.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Who at some point --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Raise your hand if you do not believe he\'s overexposed.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so that\'s one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was very confusingly phrased.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, that was actually quite well-phrased and one person --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that is not the answer.\xc2\xa0 The answer is accountability.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who wants a news conference?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, who wants to win the lottery?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying our chances are just the same?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Scratch and win, Major.\xc2\xa0 Scratch and win.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Seriously, one person in this room that said he was overexposed, just one.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not true.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just name one person who said he was overexposed.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will go back and look at the transcript and we can --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we have questions about pundits.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not pundits; we\'re reporters.\xc2\xa0 There are pundits out there who were saying -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you have a question or an opinion, Mr. Pundit?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I actually do.\xc2\xa0 Going back to Wall Street firms, three firms:\xc2\xa0 Goldman, Morgan and Chase have set aside $47 billion, I believe the number is, on bonuses.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that\'s appropriate and is there anything he has talked about or hopes to do, to do something about that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Chip, I think you heard Dr. Romer this weekend and I think you\'ve heard the President throughout the past year talk about the continued divergence from, in all ways, reality of what\'s going on, on Main Street and what\'s going on in some of these firms on Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 There are folks that just continue not to get it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he doing anything about it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has discussed ways of -- well, we can -- we have done stuff relating to banks that have received extraordinary assistance from the federal government.\xc2\xa0 There is a lot less, as you know, that we can do with somebody that\'s not tied in terms of a direct correlation between money that\'s given through TARP.\xc2\xa0 The President has repeatedly pushed, and the House passed as part of their financial reform, a say on pay.\xc2\xa0 We have greatly encouraged anybody that\'s giving out bonuses and executive compensation to tie it not to short-term risk-taking but to the long-term health of the company, as most stockholders and taxpayers would prefer; and that is, give that compensation in stock, have it vest over a series of years so that the health of the firm is first and foremost, not short-term risks that might have people making different actions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But despite everything the President said and everything that he\'s proposed and everything that\'s been done, this may be the biggest year yet for money falling from the sky for these guys.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, there\'s just -- like I said, there\'s a limit to what the President can do for firms that don\'t receive assistance from the American government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Use the bully pulpit more effectively, just get out there?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he could pick up the phone and call these guys.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can assure you the meeting that we had not recently -- not too recently with the bankers in the Roosevelt Room included a discussion about executive compensation.\xc2\xa0 I think they know where we are on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say they\'re just not listening to him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they\'re not listening to the American people, Chip.\xc2\xa0 I think -- like I said, I think there\'s a divergence in reality as to what\'s going on in this economy if you talk to somebody that is in line for a huge cash bonus at a Wall Street firm and a small business on Main Street that\'s trying to get a loan, that\'s trying to get some help, and trying to get their business and this economy back on track, absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President talks about this, does he still get visibly angry about it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\'t -- the truth is -- I think the story that you were referring to was the one in Sunday\'s paper.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know anybody, save for a few that work for those banks, that don\'t get visibly angry and in reading those stories, absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think these banks have been forthcoming in their assets?\xc2\xa0 Why did they need these big bailouts, and they paid them back almost immediately?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any reason to question the financial straits that they were in at the time in which they received TARP recovery money.\xc2\xa0 I will say this, Helen, and the President strongly believes this -- is that was in many ways of their own doing, which I think is what gets people that much more exercised about this.\xc2\xa0 And I think what the President has discussed and the reason why the President has pushed financial reform is to ensure that we have rules of the road that doesn\'t let the type of activity that caused this to happen to ever happen again, forcing the American taxpayers to have to make decisions about the financial system collapsing or providing TARP money for these guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on the $47 billion, is he basically throwing in the towel and saying there\'s nothing I can do?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, no.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, there\'s little we can do legislatively.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ll -- the President will continue to talk about this both in public and in private with these bankers.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Real quick on Mrs. Biden\'s funeral.\xc2\xa0 Will the President speak at that funeral?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe that\'s the case, but I think he and the First Lady are just going, but I think they\'re working on logistics.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On the meeting of Labor leaders today, is the President\'s message to them essentially, tough luck, we\'re going to tax the Cadillac plans?\xc2\xa0 Or can he be persuaded?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think the point of the meeting is to have this discussion.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have more to say about that discussion at the conclusion of the meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So his position could move.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President -- obviously the President has a position, and I think we\'ll talk to them about why he sees this as something that\'s important in the bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I think last week some senior aide said we should expect more of a focus on the economy this week, and I wondered how we might expect that to manifest itself.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think on Wednesday we\'ll have an event in the local area to talk about some jobs ideas and some economic numbers.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the rest of the week\'s schedule in front of me, but I think over the course of the next several weeks you\'ll see a number of economic events on our plate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How involved are you guys, then, in shaping the jobs bill that\'s happening in the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the -- we\'ve certainly been in communications with the House and the Senate about different jobs packages as the President outlined in December here in Washington.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just to follow on the bank fee issue, isn\'t the bank fee being considered as part of the budget?\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t this something -- a way to sort of address this question of bonuses?\xc2\xa0 And I had a question on calibration, given that there are 8,500 banks in the country and a large majority of them would come in for a fee that would be levied on banks.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you square this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into details and specifics on a budget that will be released at a later day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s at the printers?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And when it comes back from Kinko\'s, we\'ll be able to talk about it.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not really at Kinko\'s, though, I was just -- go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is your assessment of the situation in Yemen now as a terror hotbed, if you will, a source of the kind of plots that we saw on Christmas, especially considering the comments that have come out of there in the past couple of days from the President of Yemen and from a leading cleric there talking about foreign intervention and what it would be bring?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, as you well know, this has been on the President and the national security team\'s radar for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 The security situation there obviously remains quite perilous.\xc2\xa0 There are vast areas of largely ungoverned space that have attracted al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and other extremist allies in Yemen and throughout the region.\xc2\xa0 I think the President and his team have been and still are acutely aware of the threats that could be emanating and are emanating from that region.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think this is for domestic consumption, these comments about -- whipping up comments about foreign intervention, and why did the President find it necessary to say what he did in the magazine interview about the prospects for U.S. --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that, you know, whether it was General Petraeus or President Obama, I think discussing whether or not boots, American boots on the ground was something that was -- something the administration was planning I think is something the President simply put to rest is not happening.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on this one, on Yemen, please?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President also said that he\'s willing to talk to al Qaeda member, if they repent -- the President of Yemen.\xc2\xa0 And his national security advisor said that Yemen is not a haven for extremists.\xc2\xa0 Does this undermine the administration and the President\'s effort to combat terrorism, especially in Yemen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I mean, our position on disrupting, dismantling, and defeating al Qaeda is not any different today than it was several days ago.\xc2\xa0 We have worked closely with the Yemeni government to address threats that have come out of Yemen, the security situation there, and we\'ll continue to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he wants to talk to them.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, our posture as it relates to al Qaeda has not changed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me make another pass at the banking one, but in the context of the deficit we\'ve heard a lot from the President on the course of reducing the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Are you guys ruling out any sort of transaction, tax, or bank fee as a way to lower the deficit?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to add more in specificity to what I have yet to add to the previous four people that have asked.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two people.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Two.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re not ruling it out?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not ruling it in or ruling it out, how about that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is like a new jobs bill.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>On START, where are you guys on that?\xc2\xa0 Are you guys getting closer?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are we --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We continue to work with our Russian counterparts on trying to find an agreement that, quite frankly, that works for both sides.\xc2\xa0 I need to go back and look at some notes about whether it was this Friday or the previous Friday that we had a negotiating team that headed to -- headed over to make some headway on that.\xc2\xa0 But nothing as of yet to report.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said in answer to Ben\'s question about the Cadillac plans that the President supports the Senate bill.\xc2\xa0 Well, the President also supported the House bill.\xc2\xa0 He put out statements on both, and they have divergent points of view on this question.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House open to in any way reshaping the level at which the surtax in the Senate bill would apply to the Cadillac so-called health benefits?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that something that is negotiable --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- within the contexts of these conversations --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President looks forward to speaking with leaders today about their ideas and about their concerns, and I certainly think the level is one of the topics that will come up.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have more to say about the meeting after the meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know that the level would come up.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just trying to find out if the White House is open to having that level adjusted.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re certainly open to having that discussion, which will happen today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not adjusting it, necessarily?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think we\'d be having the discussion if we weren\'t interested in hearing their viewpoint.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very good.\xc2\xa0 On Senator Reid\'s comments, the President and other advisors have said it was a poor choice of words.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering if you could tell us what would have been a better way to express what Harry Reid was actually saying?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the opportunity to not just speak for an elected official but speak as the Senator from Nevada.\xc2\xa0 I just think that would be a weird place for me to go given -- I\'d be up here doing impersonations all day, Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess what I\'m getting at is, there was nothing that the President found objectionable or untoward about what he was saying, just the way he said it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President didn\'t take offense personally, but believes that, as the statement said, this was an unfortunate choice of words.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what the statement said.\xc2\xa0 He knows --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not an unfortunate observation about his particular political strengths going into the campaign -- that\'s what Harry Reid was talking about.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think Senator Reid -- I have not read the book -- later in the book makes the point that -- not only does he not think race is going to detract from, but that it will be a positive for the campaign.\xc2\xa0 So obviously it\'s a very poor choice, a very unfortunate choice of words.\xc2\xa0 The President got that apology from Senator Reid, didn\'t take offense to it, and has moved on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you want to react to any Republicans calls for him to step down or asserting that there\'s a double-standard here vis-\xc3\xa0-vis the Trent Lott situation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I think you need to go back and -- I think it\'s helpful to go back and see what was said in the previous instance.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I appreciate that some are drawing a direct analogy.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t understand exactly how one draws the analogy to a former Majority Leader expressing his support for the defeat of Harry Truman in 1948 so that Strom Thurmond would be President running on a state\'s rights ticket.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t see how that\'s analogous to what Senator Reid was saying.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I mean, I understand what people have to say on TV or to get themselves on TV.\xc2\xa0 I would suggest they spend about 20 seconds reading a little history and figuring out that to draw that analogy strains any intellectual enterprise or any real reality, in all sense of the word.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On politics, there are indications the Massachusetts Senate race is tightening up.\xc2\xa0 The DNC sent -- top staff were there today.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any intention of going up to Massachusetts to campaign on behalf of Martha Coakley?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\'t have any travel plans to campaign in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, given the meeting with the Labor leaders later today, do you think the President has done right by a movement that was so much a part of his victory in November, the Labor movement?\xc2\xa0 Is he -- has he done right by them?\xc2\xa0 Has he advanced their agenda in the way that he should?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has represented working men and women in this country in everything that he\'s worked on, whether it was making a decision to save two companies from going bankrupt, whether it was pushing a Recovery plan, I think a whole host obviously of legislative initiatives that have benefited working men and women in this country, absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just one quick question on a timetable on Iran sanctions.\xc2\xa0 You said last year that we\'re looking, once the end of the year came, we\'d be looking at a decision.\xc2\xa0 Do you have -- when do you hope to have a coalition together to move forward on Security Council --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we continue to work with our partners in the P5-plus-1, as you heard the President say last year, in putting together the next steps moving forward.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\'s some magic day in which that all happens at the U.N. -- at least I don\'t have that day.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to -- we will continue to hold Iran responsible for living up to its international obligations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t have a deadline in mind?\xc2\xa0 The administration isn\'t --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the administration is working both internally on ideas that it could do, as well as working with the P5-plus-1 in a broader series that would have the support of the international community.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of quick bookkeeping -- or scheduling issues.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to be going to the Democratic issues retreat this week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I got that last week here; I will look at -- that\'s Thursday and Friday or so?\xc2\xa0 Let me find that out, scheduling-wise.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And any closer to a State of the Union date?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one of substance, if I may -- North Korea, they\'re suggesting -- (laughter) -- well, process and substance -- North Korea\'s assertion today that the United States and it should settle on a treaty by the end of this year to finally -- the peace treaty that would finally end the Korean conflict, and how that is important in terms of settling the nuclear issue, as well.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the North Koreans are well aware of what they need to do to come back to talks with -- to six-party talks in dealing with this issue, and that is give up the idea of a nuclear state on the peninsula, just as it agreed to do several years ago.\xc2\xa0 If they\'re willing to live up to those obligations, then we will make progress in those talks.\xc2\xa0 But this is -- this isn\'t a step for us to take, this is a step for the North Koreans to take in living up to -- living up to those obligations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your position is six-party talks and solving the nuclear issue first, then we\'ll talk about a peace treaty?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the way to have the most constructive talks is for them to come back to the table living up to the obligations that they agreed to and then walked away from, absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a question on the labor meeting -- are you going to put out a list of the attendees in advance of the meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can get that -- we\'ll send that out to you as soon as we\'re done here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you keep on saying you\'re going to have a readout or you\'ll tell us later, in what form are you going to tell us whatever?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just a little e-mail.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a little -- okay.\xc2\xa0 And a question about the meeting itself:\xc2\xa0 A lot of labor leaders have been saying recently that it\'s going to be very hard for them to motivate their members and their kind of mid-level leaders to do the kind of foot-soldiering the Democratic candidates are really going to depend on in the fall if they don\'t see progress either on the Cadillac plans or the Employee Free Choice Act, other things that are very important to them.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a lot of kind of disillusionment in their ranks.\xc2\xa0 What can the President say to help change their minds?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President looks forward to having this discussion today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I think working men and women in this country will be plenty motivated in 2010 about the choices that they have in front of them.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I have a quick follow up?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- let me finish the answer and I will -- I don\'t think working men and women --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many working men and women are meeting with labor leaders?\xc2\xa0 I mean, they\'re part of the Democratic infrastructure --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking about the same group of people, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying they\'ll be plenty motivated because -- if you could finish that last --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because of the -- I think when one looks at what the President\'s agenda is, and one looks at the lack of an agenda on the other side in dealing with any problem that somebody in -- a working person in the middle class deals with, I don\'t think it will be a hard decision to make when one looks at the agenda on the President\'s side:\xc2\xa0 what we\'ve done to get our economy restarted, to make college more affordable, to bring health care to those that don\'t have it and to correct insurance imbalances for those that do, versus -- I mean, I hesitate to discuss what\'s on the other side, because I haven\'t heard anybody on the other side discuss it, except for a series of decisions that want to take us back to the same place we were in before the 2008 election.</p>\n<p>I think working men and women will ask themselves who is on the side of insurance companies and who is on the side of taking insurance companies on.\xc2\xa0 I think that will be an argument that will be front and center, and I think working men and women will make that decision.</p>\n<p>Who had a follow-up on that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I think the question that some labor leaders are asking is that during the campaign, candidate Obama accused candidate John McCain of wanting to tax Cadillac health plans.\xc2\xa0 He said, "McCain will and I won\'t."\xc2\xa0 So, why the change in position?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 But understand, Bill, because I know you paid attention extensively during the campaign.\xc2\xa0 Understand -- remember what John McCain wanted to do, right -- any plan was a Cadillac plan, because we were taking the tax deductibility of health care out, away.\xc2\xa0 And that was going to be met -- that would be fulfilling your health care needs by handing you a $2,000 voucher if you were an individual or a $5,000 voucher if you were a family.</p>\n<p>Now, we\'ve had a long discussion about health care in this country over the past eight or nine months.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not talking about $2,000 insurance plans.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not talking about $5,000 insurance plans for families of four.\xc2\xa0 There is a difference between what the President has supported, which is at a $23,000 level, taxing an insurance company that offers a plan in excess of that amount, versus what John McCain proposed, which was to end the tax deductibility completely for health care that\'s provided in this country.\xc2\xa0 I think they\'re fundamentally different -- well, I don\'t think it, they are fundamentally different ideas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said, "What if you\'re one of the steelworkers who are working" -- this is Obama -- "What if you are one of the steelworkers who are working right here in Newport News, and you\'ve given up wage increases in exchange for better health care."</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I read that on your blog, too.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the -- the point I just made to Bill is the same.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a difference between --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not inconsistent?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not inconsistent because what he was talking about was two fundamentally different things.\xc2\xa0 Removing the tax deductibility of any part of your health care and capping for -- taxing insurance companies that offer a health care plan in excess of a $23,000 limit -- they\'re not in the same ballpark, they\'re not in the same state.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\'t dispute what the -- about the here and now point that the unions make, that one in four of their rank and file workers could be affected by the tax structure in the Senate bill negatively; you don\'t dispute that, do you?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something I\'m sure will come up in the President\'s meeting today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he\'s meeting today --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to try to tease that out, right?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But the notion that somehow --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t dispute -- you acknowledge that that\'s an implication of the Senate bill.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If you will acknowledge that what the President has talked about and supports and making the point that somehow that\'s analogous to what he opposed with Senator McCain\'s proposal isn\'t also close to being reality, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, I mean -- but I\'ve never -- I\'ve not gone down that road.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just asking --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 But in the event that you were to travel down that road.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He doesn\'t answer hypotheticals.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, he doesn\'t do hypotheticals, right, yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Your spokesperson there saved you on that one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying the President would abide by basically what he said in the campaign, which is those workers who did negotiate so that they have better health care instead of wage increases, they would not be impacted?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s something they\'re going to discuss today.</p>\n<p>Christi.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I\'ll go back -- go to Christi, and then I\'ll come back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On two different topics, if I can.\xc2\xa0 First of all, has the White House Chief of Staff signaled to the President that he\'s entertaining the idea of leaving to run for any office or to do anything else?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he addressed this on --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m glad you mentioned that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- Savannah\'s new cable show seen daily at 9:00 a.m.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>I think he committed to Savannah to be here through 2010.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He did, indeed.\xc2\xa0 That\'s MSNBC.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any other high-level personnel changes coming that -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\'m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And back to the Yemen transfers or the Guantanamo transfers for just a minute.\xc2\xa0 You halted the ones to Yemen.\xc2\xa0 Are you still going forward as before with repatriations to other countries?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We are continuing the process whereby the task force evaluates all that are there for the status of their case and to understand how, in closing Guantanamo Bay, they\'ll be dealt with.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s no other kind of hold on any other country?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are people going into rehabilitation programs in any country at all?\xc2\xa0 Is that being --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because we\'re not -- you know, we\'ve -- this is like the third -- we just aren\'t going to get into the specifics of agreements that are ultimately made in terms of transfer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but can you say, are you reviewing the Saudi rehab program right now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\'re making determinations about -- making determinations about each case at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is any one of those determinations that you are suspending possible transfer into their rehab program in Saudi Arabia?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure they continue to evaluate but there have not been any pronouncements on that.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, last week Governor Schwarzenegger urged his congressional delegation either to make sure California got the same Medicaid deal as Nebraska or else vote against the health care bill.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House support extending the Nebraska payment system nationwide?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say this, that the President obviously understands greatly the fiscal situation the governors find themselves in.\xc2\xa0 I think a pretty good understanding of how the President feels is a big chunk of the Recovery Act was for FMAP Medicaid funding to go to help states out of their fiscal situation.\xc2\xa0 And the President wants to work with governors in understanding in tough economic times and in tough budget times taking on new challenges.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re going to continue to work with governors.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he would be open to the idea?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s certainly part of the discussion.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Yemen, the fact that the President of Yemen is even talking about talking to al Qaeda seems to sort of have thrown quite a large conflict with the administration\'s policy.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House confident that the President of Yemen is -- can be relied on to help combat extremism there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, as evidence of the steps that he\'s taken over the last many months to deal with it, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And we believe -- we believe that the President is taking the necessary steps, and we continue to support his efforts to combat extremism.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two questions, Robert.\xc2\xa0 On Friday you addressed Rudy Giuliani\'s comments that there were no domestic attacks under Bush.\xc2\xa0 And since then he revised his statement to say that he meant to say no domestic attacks on American soil by Islamic terrorists since 9/11.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s accurate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And my second question --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, you know --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 That was fast.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, no, I mean, I think what was missing was --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean -- right.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What was missing from --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are several examples, though, that don\'t fit that, so I wanted to see --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say this.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t -- I can go through the -- look at vast numbers of examples.\xc2\xa0 My point was that the mayor of New York had forgotten about an attack that happened in New York during that administration, and I was caught off guard by that fact, as I think anybody that might have been watching was sort of caught off guard by what he was saying and what he meant to say.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you satisfied with the clarification in that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to look at what other instances he\'s -- again, my point of contention was September 11th, which I thought it was weird that he\'d forgotten.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the second question.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a story on the front page of the Daily Caller today, says something like --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\'s that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Where\'s Jon?\xc2\xa0 Is he not -- that joke\'s no good if he\'s not here.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The story -- the headline is something to the effect of that the Christmas bomber was singing like a canary until the Obama administration read him his rights.\xc2\xa0 And I remember there was a briefing last weekend, John Brennan said something like -- I don\'t know if he put this fine a point on it, but is it true that the FBI is satisfied that they\'ve gotten all the information that they could out of the suspect before he lawyered-up?\xc2\xa0 I thought I heard him say something like that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think what I\'ve said and what John has said is that the FBI questioned the terror suspect after the incident, and were satisfied with what they -- the usable information that they got, absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s no feeling like they left something on the field there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Or on the table.</p>\n<p>Keith.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, why isn\'t the President going to campaign for Martha Coakley?\xc2\xa0 It\'s a tight race, very important to his agenda, potentially.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s just not on our schedule to go to next week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, then why is it not on the schedule?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s just not on the schedule.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been asked by the Coakley campaign to come?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been asked to stay away?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he concerned -- is there concern that his -- I mean, it just doesn\'t make any sense -- is he concerned that his current popularity ratings --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if he goes up there that he might hurt her campaign?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just not -- it\'s just not on the schedule.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the scheduler, actually, who has decided not to send him?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I didn\'t say it was -- you didn\'t ask me that.\xc2\xa0 We just -- it\'s not on the schedule as a trip the President is going to make.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ken.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, it looks like Harold Ford is very serious about jumping into the Senate race in New York.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the White House\'s position on having a candidate like Harold Ford run for that Senate seat?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the White House is quite happy with the leadership and the representation of Senator Gillibrand in New York, and as many are in the DSCC, we\'re supporting her reelection.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how would you handicap the chances of Rahm and Senator Schumer to clear the field this time around?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Stay tuned.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n1:20 P.M. EST</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
