EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Take us away, Mr. Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 We have your statement earlier about developments in Egypt, but I\'m wondering if you could start off by telling us the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal reaction to the bloody chaos in the streets.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ben, the President has been updated throughout the morning on this, both as part of his PDB as well as some written updates throughout the morning on some of these images.\xc2\xa0 The President and this administration strongly condemn the outrageous and deplorable violence that\'s taking place on the streets of Cairo -- that\'s taking place on the streets of Cairo today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have said that throughout this process.\xc2\xa0 Obviously if any of the violence is instigated by the government, it should stop immediately.\xc2\xa0 That has been our message throughout this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think, Ben, this underscores precisely what the President was speaking about last night, and that is the time for a transition has come and that time is now.\xc2\xa0 The Egyptian people need to see change.\xc2\xa0 We know that that meaningful transition must include opposition voices and parties being involved in this process as we move toward free and fair elections.\xc2\xa0 But that process must begin now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said last night that he -- he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to commend the Egyptian military for the professionalism and patriotism that it\xe2\x80\x99s shown thus far in allowing peaceful protests while protecting the Egyptian people.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What does he -- what are his thoughts this morning about the way the military is handling itself?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\'re watching, as people are throughout the world, what is happening today.\xc2\xa0 We continue to urge restraint.\xc2\xa0 We continue -- I will say what the President said last night -- I do think that the role that had been played by the military was exceedingly important in what I think many people thought might happen late last week.\xc2\xa0 Again, it is imperative that the violence that we\'re seeing stop and that the transition that was spoken about last night begin immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that point -- just two others -- when he talks about that the transition must be meaningful, peaceful and must begin now, a phrase that you\xe2\x80\x99ve repeated today --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- can you explain how this situation moves from President Obama talking about change now, President Mubarak talking about change in September?\xc2\xa0 Is President Obama powerless to actually make that happen?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear that these are very fluid and dynamic events.\xc2\xa0 I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen happen over the course of the past many days, quite honestly, Ben, are events that many people have not seen -- nobody has seen in their lifetime.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President last night pretty clearly, and I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly here to say that the conversation that the President had with President Mubarak was direct, it was frank, it was candid.\xc2\xa0 And without getting into exactly what was said, I think the message that the President delivered clearly to President Mubarak was that the time for change had some.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m still trying to get at that core question of what the President -- this President can do about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the -- I think change in all of these instances -- what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen transpire, Ben, over the course of the past many days in Cairo and around Egypt has taken place as a result of change that\'s needed to happen from within the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you have seen statements from throughout the world, both in the region and outside of the region, where President Obama and leaders have been clear about what needs to happen.\xc2\xa0 Many of these changes are going to have to happen on the ground in Egypt, and only those in Egypt will -- can determine when those demands have been satisfied.\xc2\xa0 But it is clear that the Egyptian people need to see progress and change immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, we have not had a chance to ask President Obama any questions since this crisis began.\xc2\xa0 There have been at least a couple occasions that could have been open to the press that weren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain why we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to talk to him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ben, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a chance likely to talk to the President later in the week when Prime Minister Harper is here.\xc2\xa0 We have had a couple of occasions that have been still photographers only.\xc2\xa0 It was -- those are part of the coverage plans that have been in place for a bit now in terms of those events.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will say this, Ben.\xc2\xa0 I think we have, like you all, watched a series of rapidly moving events.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the President in what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to keep you up to date as best we can on what goes on, knowing, quite honestly, that some things in foreign policy have to be done away from TV cameras.\xc2\xa0 Those are the types of direct and frank talks that the President had last night with President Mubarak.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it was to avoid questions on Egypt?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said that it was not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President, just like the protesters on the streets in Egypt, are clearly unhappy with Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on staying in power until the elections in September.\xc2\xa0 To put pressure on him, what are the specific steps that the administration is considering?\xc2\xa0 Could that include a cutoff or curtailing of aid to try to push this along?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I want to peel these questions apart slightly.\xc2\xa0 First and foremost, these are very quick, rapidly moving events and we are watching them like you are.\xc2\xa0 The question specifically on aid, as I said I believe last Friday, we will evaluate the actions of the government of Egypt in making and reviewing decisions about aid.\xc2\xa0 That continues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton said that that was not under discussion as of the weekend --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is that now under discussion?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what she said.\xc2\xa0 I think she -- go back and read the transcript.\xc2\xa0 She said, had a decision been made to cut off -- and she said no.\xc2\xa0 And I would say that no decision has been made.\xc2\xa0 She also said later in that answer that we certainly review our assistance posture, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but the President says he wants Mubarak to begin the transition now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he asking him, with those words, to say that he\xe2\x80\x99s leaving before September, to announce his resignation, or to speed up the election process?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Matt, some of these obviously are decisions that are going to be -- as you heard the President say, need to be made in concert with a whole host of and full range of voices in the ground in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 I am not going to get into a greater level of specificity as to the direct nature of the conversation that was had except to reiterate what the President said in terms of that transition beginning now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the level of contact right now?\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to be speaking to Mubarak?\xc2\xa0 Has Ambassador Wisner had further contacts, either meetings or talks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Wisner is -- remains in the country. I do not know of plans as I walked out here to speak with President Mubarak today.\xc2\xa0 I know the President did end his call by telling the President that he would remain in contact and would remain in contact and would feel free to -- President Obama would feel free to call at any time if he needed to speak directly with President Mubarak.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are a range of conversations that are happening throughout our government at many levels.\xc2\xa0 We have a very, very capable embassy and an ambassador there that\xe2\x80\x99s working with former Ambassador Wisner on a full range of these problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I assume, as this crisis has developed, that the President and the national security team have been gaming out all the possible outcomes each step of the way.\xc2\xa0 Is that a safe assumption?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we have done that as events have transpired and as events have changed, sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will say this, Jake.\xc2\xa0 I would go back again and look at what this administration, what this President, has said specifically about changes that need to happen to respect the universal rights that we\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken of both in Egypt and throughout the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s recent speech in Doha as outlining a series of these steps.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you game this out, what\xe2\x80\x99s the best-case scenario here, and what\xe2\x80\x99s the worst-case scenario?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into a series of hypotheticals, because I think what\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think we would --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought you just said you guys are getting into a series of hypotheticals.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m just not going to get into them here.\xc2\xa0 Of course we are planning for a full range of scenarios.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, Jake, to understand that -- I think it is hard to even imagine several days ago the events that happened yesterday.\xc2\xa0 So events across this landscape are happening very quickly.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re watching those events.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re planning for those events.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a deputies committee meeting that starts very shortly where we will get into a -- they will get into a whole range of issues.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we are concerned about violence that I talked about.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about reports of food and fuel shortages in some of the cities and the ability to get what might be certain entry points and ports over to people that are in desperate need of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that Mubarak is a dictator?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More importantly, does the President think Mubarak is a dictator?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The administration believes that President Mubarak has a chance to show the world exactly who he is by beginning this transition that is so desperately needed in his country and for his people now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any regrets that when this crisis began to unfold eight days ago he -- his public statements were not more in line with the speech he gave in Cairo in 2009?\xc2\xa0 In other words, the initial comments were a lot more pro-Mubarak, cautioning demonstrators not to engage in violence, as well as --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, I don\'t think -- let me be clear.\xc2\xa0 Eight days later we don\'t think violence should be -- we don\'t want to see violence on protestors.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t want to see looting.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 His comments yesterday --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- were that the protestors were an inspiration.\xc2\xa0 His comments on Friday were they had the right to do what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing but they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t engage in violence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And that continues to be our posture, Jake.\xc2\xa0 I think --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Certainly it\xe2\x80\x99s a journey.\xc2\xa0 I mean, certainly his --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I think for us to not acknowledge that -- again, I don\'t know what you guys, from a coverage standpoint, predicted would be what we\xe2\x80\x99d be looking at on Wednesday last Thursday.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we are watching events that have not transpired as they have in this region of the world in thousands of years.\xc2\xa0 We have -- obviously a considerable amount of staff time has been spent on this.\xc2\xa0 Some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s time obviously has been dedicated to watching and -- watching, taking note of, and responding to the events that have transpired.\xc2\xa0 Again, what we\'re watching is history being made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no regrets that his initial comments weren\'t more in line with the 2009 Cairo speech?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the notion that what we have said in public and in private at all levels of our government to all levels of the Egyptian government, to governments throughout the Middle East, have not been in line with the Cairo speech is simply wrong.\xc2\xa0 the Cairo speech, the President stood up for a universal set of values and actions that had to be taken by governments, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say over the course of many days here, that have to be responsive to their people.\xc2\xa0 That is precisely what the President believes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These are not going to be determinations that -- and I said a few days ago, these are not determinations that are going to be made by us.\xc2\xa0 Nobody in Washington will determine the range of freedom of assembly or freedom of speech for those in Tahrir Square.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think anybody in Tahrir Square is looking for us to gauge what the fence posts are on those freedoms.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but I think they\'re there -- they want the President to be standing up more for them and less for Mubarak.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what they -- that\'s what they\'re telling our reporters, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re -- I don\'t know the degree to which they\xe2\x80\x99ve heard everything that the President\xe2\x80\x99s said.\xc2\xa0 I think the notion that the President has somehow shifted from one side or the other is completely inaccurate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 When you talk about the transition happening now, how do you define \xe2\x80\x9cnow\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Because now means today not September.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, now means yesterday -- because when we said now we meant yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So I mean I think the definition of now is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when you say now today, it means now --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I meant yesterday --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- or yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is -- again, I want to be clear.\xc2\xa0 This is\xc2\xa0 -- though we are in the here and now, now started yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that\'s what, Dan -- what the people of Egypt want to see is not some process that starts a week, a month or several months from now.\xc2\xa0 This is a --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not satisfied with September as an out date for President Mubarak?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re asking if now is September, it is unseasonably warm, but it is not September.\xc2\xa0 Now means now.\xc2\xa0 The transition -- there are things that the government needs to do.\xc2\xa0 There are reforms that need to be undertaken, and there are opposition entities that have to be included in the conversations as we move toward free and fair elections that we\xe2\x80\x99ve advocated for quite some time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is the White House then satisfied with Mubarak in power until September?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I am not going to get into all the details of what they discussed.\xc2\xa0 The conversation was frank and the transition must begin now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the major event that seemed to cause a shift in I guess policy for this administration -- a week ago talking about Egypt being a stable government, seemingly supporting Mubarak, and now --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute.\xc2\xa0 I think I was asked if --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- trying to nudge him --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, Dan, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not in editorial meetings at CNN.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a week ago you guys thought we would be seeing now.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying what you were saying then was there was a stable government and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But, Dan, if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me if events have changed over the course of the week, the answer to that is of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying -- I said what was the one event that caused the shift from saying that it is a stable --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- there have been a series of events on the ground that have I think shifted, quite frankly -- when you shift anchors into the region, I assume that\xe2\x80\x99s based on certain things that are happening on the ground.\xc2\xa0 Events have, again, moved enormously quickly in a very volatile region of the world and we have -- the likes of which, again, we have not seen in our lifetimes.\xc2\xa0 That just simply demands that we continue to watch and continue to ensure that we are taking the steps to communicate directly with all of the entities of their government about what we expect in terms of non-violence, what the world expects in terms of non-violence, and the steps that need to take place in order to see that transition.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert -- and maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m parsing words too much here -- but yesterday the President, talking about the transition, said it must begin now.\xc2\xa0 And when you walked in you said the time for a transition has come, and that time is now.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x9cbegin now.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Were you ratcheting up a little more by not putting the word \xe2\x80\x9cbegin\xe2\x80\x9d in there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to parse too much, but I think the events of yesterday began that transition yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think that is what -- most importantly, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the people of Egypt expect.\xc2\xa0 And I think the people of Egypt need to see progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President object to a decision by Mubarak to step down now?\xc2\xa0 Would there be a fear that that would leave Egypt leaderless?\xc2\xa0 Does he need to stay in power, at least for the short term?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That is not a decision that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s not your decision, but would he think that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad idea?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, again, I\'m not going to get into fleshing out some of the very specifics of the conversation that was had. I think progress and change must come to Cairo, progress and change must come to Egypt, and it needs to happen quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a timeline -- at some point, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there going to have to be some kind of timeline, other than September?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he going to have to get out before then if these protests are not going to simply continue and increase?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again -- well, I assume those are discussions that are being had by the top levels of their government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are they being had by the top levels of our government?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I said to Jake, I think a full range of scenarios and a full range of events are being watched and discussed in many buildings throughout Washington.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Including putting more pressure on Mubarak to get out sooner?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'d point you to what the President said last night.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you in the room when he was on the phone with Mubarak?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you get the sense that the President thought Mubarak gets it, or was there some frustration on the part of the President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into reading out some of that stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s communications to Mubarak made the difference here?\xc2\xa0 Does the President have that kind of power in this situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say, Chip, I think that -- I think we have been clear with the government of Egypt before this the steps that needed to take place.\xc2\xa0 I think we have communicated publicly and privately important steps that -- and important reforms that need to take place.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think, though, it is important to understand that we are obviously watching -- we\xe2\x80\x99re watching some -- we\xe2\x80\x99re watching the events based on what is happening on the ground there.\xc2\xa0 And I think, as I said earlier, I think the world is watching, and the world is commenting on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen happen and what we know must take place over the next many days and weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as far as what President Mubarak did and what he will do in the future, is President Obama basically calling the shots?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, look, again, I don\'t know the direct answer in terms of that, Chip.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think at each juncture of this, we have again made I think public and private comments about the situation and what needed to have happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you will hear this administration, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s at the Pentagon, at the State Department, inside of this building, again, continue to communicate with both the government of and the people of Egypt about what the world expects.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wendell.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do we have evidence or indications that some of this violence is being instigated by the government?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not been -- I have not seen the latest on that in terms of whether or not we do, Wendell.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Suspicions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hypothesize.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important, though, is that the message must be that the violence stop, and that in the event that any entity or any government entity is behind any of this, it must stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because some of the reporting out there indicates that its government thugs who are responsible for this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President ask Mr. Mubarak to supervise the transition?\xc2\xa0 Did he ask him, don\'t leave, supervise the transition of power?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the specifics of -- Wendell, I think the President was clear and I think the President was clear publicly that the transition must begin now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Kerry of Massachusetts has suggested a caretaker government.\xc2\xa0 Does the President support that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s suggested, and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take a look at that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President get any indication from Mubarak that there was going to be a crackdown today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did -- even if -- I understand you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about hypotheticals, but was it made clear -- did the President make clear to Mubarak that there were consequences in the American-Egypt relationship if he did not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if he did not take the President\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- we have been clear with the government and the President was clear on continued stance of non-violence. Quite frankly, we would not have accepted anything less.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we have made it fairly well known what we think needs to happen and what is and what is not acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have we made it clear there are consequences if they do not abide by what we believe is the right thing to do?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have -- we talked late last week about our aid posture.\xc2\xa0 And I think first and foremost, Chuck, the -- I think those are -- that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the ground right now.\xc2\xa0 I think the people of Egypt need to see change.\xc2\xa0 The people of Egypt need to see progress.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the world needs to see.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you -- is there a fear that you will lose -- if you push Mubarak too hard, you will lose the ability to influence him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I would go back to what I said earlier to Jake, that we are -- we evaluate a whole range of activities and scenarios.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me circle back one more time.\xc2\xa0 It seems like you\xe2\x80\x99re avoiding using the word -- are there policy consequences on the table that Mubarak is aware of if --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, I think you have to understand that there are limits to what I can say about all of the private discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand you can\xe2\x80\x99t say what\xe2\x80\x99s on the table, but is it clear -- I mean, is it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not think the President could have been clearer with the President of Egypt last night.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President last night praised the professionalism of the Egyptian military.\xc2\xa0 Right now the military is being criticized for not intervening to help protesters who are being brutalized.\xc2\xa0 Is there such a thing as a sin of omission by the military, and would this -- would the U.S. government call for the Egyptian military to intervene on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan, let me -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get over -- let me see if I can get a direct answer from some of the military-to-military contacts on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the military-to-military contacts.\xc2\xa0 And one other thing -- back to the aid review.\xc2\xa0 I mean you brought that up on Friday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Back to the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The review of U.S. aid to Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You brought that up by yourself on Friday.\xc2\xa0 Can you at least tell us where that review is?\xc2\xa0 What is the status of that review?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me see if I can get an update.\xc2\xa0 I said that we would -- that review would be based on actions going forward, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve not gotten any greater guidance on it from there.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if there\xe2\x80\x99s any review to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following up on that, you mentioned before the role of images of violence.\xc2\xa0 Do you think what\xe2\x80\x99s happening today is particularly important in this review of assistance to Egypt?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, any violence and any role that entities play -- will take part in that.\xc2\xa0 I do not want to -- I don\'t have anything to announce on that.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, we will evaluate what has happened, and the images that we see based on that and a full range -- as it relates to a full range of options going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I do want to -- if I can just be clear, though, and reiterate that we have said this from the very beginning, the President has said this at every opportunity, and every official in our government in speaking with officials in the Egyptian government have used every opportunity first and foremost to reiterate that any steps that are taken must not include violence.\xc2\xa0 We reiterate that call today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the people of Egypt -- they do not want to see appointments.\xc2\xa0 They do not want to see speeches.\xc2\xa0 They want to see concrete action by their government, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the world waits for.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And since the beginning of the uprising, you called the Egyptian government to stop the shutdown of the Internet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President called yesterday for transition to start now.\xc2\xa0 Well, the shutdown of the Internet continues.\xc2\xa0 The foreign minister of Egypt seems to suggest that they don\'t want to start an immediate transition now, and it\xe2\x80\x99s continuing to inflame more violence.\xc2\xa0 Do you get the impression that your messages to Cairo at this time fall on deaf ears?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think not just President Obama but leaders throughout the world have in many ways signaled the same call that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 I know that this was a topic that has been discussed in some of the calls that he\xe2\x80\x99s had with leaders in and outside of the region.\xc2\xa0 There is no acceptable excuse for not turning back on the Internet, giving people the ability to communicate with cell phones, to access social networking sites. That stuff -- those are -- as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say in trips throughout the world and in calls with the government of Egypt, those are part of the basic human freedoms that people everywhere should enjoy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the government of Egypt is responsive to you at this time?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that given the reports that Internet reception remains spotty at very best, they have not yet done what needs to happen as it relates to fulfilling that individual and basic right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, following up on Wendell\xe2\x80\x99s question, what was your motivation for bringing up or raising the specter that the Egyptian government may have been involved in instigating trouble today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is something that I think at all levels we want to ensure that the message that is sent -- and the reason I said the first message that is talked about in what we say, what I say, and what you see others say is the need to respect the rights of individuals and to ensure that this is done in an orderly and peaceful way.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure, Peter, that everyone understands that violence at any level is unacceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are reports that the administration does have evidence that someone in authority in the Mubarak government gave the go-ahead for these people to go into that square --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'ve been in -- I\'ve been out getting ready to go into this, and I have -- the last meeting I was in on this was earlier this morning.\xc2\xa0 So I can go see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that I know of on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President finally --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One Mubarak --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Excuse me, excuse me.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of questions.\xc2\xa0 You listed a number of things that the deputies were taking up in this meeting.\xc2\xa0 Would it be safe to assume that they\xe2\x80\x99re also going to talk about the very stability of the Egyptian government?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- we have talked throughout this process about the transition, as I mentioned a second ago, being peaceful and orderly.\xc2\xa0 And I think stability in the country and around in the region is tremendously important, most importantly for the people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would military officers be good leaders of this orderly transition given the restraint they\xe2\x80\x99ve shown so far?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into picking either transitional or future leaders of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 I think that is -- that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the people of Egypt and a broad cross-section of those in political entities are going to decide for their country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the U.S. preparing any sort of aid package for Egypt?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as the President said last night, we are\xc2\xa0 -- we stand ready to -- and I think one of the -- again, as I mentioned earlier, I think one of the topics that was likely to be discussed this afternoon was what assistance needs or could be provided to meet some of the basic needs of the Egyptian people; what processes can we undertake, as I said, to see if there\xe2\x80\x99s a way to move some of those resources from entry points or ports into cities and areas that are in need of those resources.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any idea on specifics, dollar amount or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, nothing that I have to announce.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And who else in the region has the administration made contact with?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know the President spoke late last evening with King Abdullah of Jordan.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any other calls that he\xe2\x80\x99s made today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what came of that discussion?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me see if I can get some more information on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scott.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what is the President meeting with Senators McCain and Bingaman about?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Senator McCain, there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole host of issues that -- ranging from certainly domestic to foreign policy -- that I anticipate the two will discuss.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think -- having been in the chamber for the speech itself when the President mentioned ending earmarks and the actions that he would take to veto something if it came with earmarks, I remember two people standing up and clapping -- Senator McCain and Senator McCaskill.\xc2\xa0 It was a little bit of a lonely group in that part of the speech.\xc2\xa0 But I know they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk some about that, as obviously you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen announcements made on the Senate side that it appears as if we have seen the end of earmarks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Bingaman?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Bingaman -- obviously, Senator Bingaman plays an important role in the development of ideas around clean energy, and I think a large part of that conversation will center around the proposals that the President outlined to increase the amount of electricity that we create using clean energy, research and development around clean energy, and the manufacturing jobs that it can create.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Perry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has indicated he\xe2\x80\x99s open to some changes in the health care law.\xc2\xa0 Is the mandate something you would be open to -- any kind of switch in the individual mandate investment because of the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of, Perry.\xc2\xa0 I think the President outlined in the State of the Union some adjustments to the way small businesses are treated, particularly around the 1099s.\xc2\xa0 But we are not going to go back and fight the battles of the previous two years, and we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly happy to talk to those who want to see the law improved.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to go backwards.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to move forwards.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, do you think the President believes that this is a wake-up call not only for Mr. Mubarak but also dictators around the globe, including in China? And is the President going to speak about other dictators in the future?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me speak broadly to this in the sense that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President now on two occasions talk quite clearly about -- off of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in Egypt -- the obligations and responsibilities that those in power have to those that they represent.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you can go through a whole host of our discussions on both a public and a private level with leaders throughout the world about steps that we believe need to be taken to improve human rights, to improve basic rights, and to uphold individual liberties.\xc2\xa0 Those are discussions that the President will continue to have in public and private with leaders throughout the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, if I may, WikiLeaks and Julian has been nominated for Nobel, and do you believe that WikiLeaks, all the leaks, are authentic, has not been altered?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That all these WikiLeaks, all are authentic, has been not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not a document veracity person.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, there is a very sizeable school of thought that says in the elections that the President would like to see, if they were truly free and fair, Islamic fundamentalists would come to power in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Is the President ready to accept that outcome?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Mark, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re getting way ahead of the process and we\xe2\x80\x99re getting into -- well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot that -- we need to get the transition going to get to the point of free and fair elections.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into hypotheticals about \xe2\x80\x9cwhat if.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I think what we would like to see is a continued, stable partnership with a country that has played an invaluable role in providing some stability to a volatile region in the world, and that we would expect that a government -- that whatever government comes next, that that government respect the treaties that it has -- that previous Egyptian governments have entered into.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there an element of \xe2\x80\x9cbe careful what you wish for\xe2\x80\x9d here?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we are looking through a lot of different scenarios.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Connie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On Israel, do you have any special concern for their security?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any particular coordination with Israel?\xc2\xa0 And are you still pushing for the supposed peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, first and foremost, our consultations -- we have had consultations, as you know, between the President and the Prime Minister over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 Our position has not changed about either our involvement or the benefit of comprehensive peace in the Middle East.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, when you talk about your support for transitional process, whether you or the President, this seems to contradict what people want on the ground.\xc2\xa0 If you listen to the chanting in every language, in English or Arabic or French, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying basically one thing -- that President Mubarak has to go, not in weeks, not in September, but tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 How you reconcile these two contradicting messages?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not going to get into the very specifics of what President Obama and President Mubarak talked about.\xc2\xa0 I would direct you to what he said last night about the timing of that transition and the, as he has mentioned now both in Washington speaking about Cairo and in Cairo speaking about the broader Middle East, we hear and respect the aspirations of those throughout the world to seek greater opportunity, to seek greater freedom, and the promise that it holds for them and their families.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more thing regarding Ambassador Wisner.\xc2\xa0 Is he still in Cairo and is he still in touch with President Mubarak?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is still in Cairo and he is still in touch with all levels of the Egyptian government<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have -- if I could follow up on that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the report on the economic crisis --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have entr\xc3\xa9e if he needs to go back and talk to President Mubarak?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s there at our behest to speak with, again, all levels of the Egyptian government.\xc2\xa0 We asked him to go.\xc2\xa0 He is obviously a very respected ambassador, respected widely by the Egyptian government, and provides us an opportunity to speak directly with the President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so just two other things.\xc2\xa0 Was the President angry this morning when he saw the violence in Cairo?\xc2\xa0 It does seem that there has been some change in marching orders to the police on the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the President found the images outrageous and deplorable.\xc2\xa0 Everybody did.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do they seem to be a message of some kind about the interactions between the administration and Mubarak yesterday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they in some way a reaction to the message from Frank Wisner, for example, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and let me also just ask you this.\xc2\xa0 I need a follow up on what you said about the message to the allies -- or to friends -- U.S. friends in the region.\xc2\xa0 Is there a suggestion in these conversations that there\xe2\x80\x99s a template for other relationships between the U.S. and leaders in the region in what has transpired between President Obama and President Mubarak?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, is the message that, look, these ideals are important to the people whom you represent.\xc2\xa0 You just said the obligations -- you were just talking about the obligations of those in power.\xc2\xa0 Is that part of the message?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- let me do a couple things.\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said here for many days, I think if you -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- you have different countries throughout the region at different stages of their political development.\xc2\xa0 But regardless of that, as the President has said and as I have said, there\xe2\x80\x99s a responsibility to be responsive to those that you represent.\xc2\xa0 The conversations that the President has had with allies or partners in the region have continued to reiterate what we have said in bilateral meetings or in conversations that the President has had previously about the important steps that need to take place to honor and adhere to the individual freedoms that the President has talked about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so those have not taken -- those have continued to take place, but they haven\xe2\x80\x99t started as a result of this.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\'s why, I think I said earlier, what the President has said in these individual meetings and particularly what Secretary Clinton said in her recent speech I think provide you some pretty good road maps to what our feelings are as it relates to what countries need to do to respect those human rights.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Glenn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you\xe2\x80\x99ve used the word \xe2\x80\x9ctransition\xe2\x80\x9d about 15 or 20 times today.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the definition of that term, is the definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9ctransition\xe2\x80\x9d a government that does not include Hosni Mubarak?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think what President Mubarak said yesterday is he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be the next leader of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 I think that was clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you have said now versus September, transition now.\xc2\xa0 Does transition now mean no Hosni Mubarak now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Glenn, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into more specificity about what the Presidents -- the two Presidents spoke about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to follow up -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned a couple of times also that we are having discussions with all levels of Egyptian government.\xc2\xa0 Are we speaking with leaders in the army?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what are we talking to them about?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about over the past several days, Admiral Mullen has spoken with his counterpart.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates has spoken with his counterpart.\xc2\xa0 Officers throughout our command ranks have spoken to their counterparts.\xc2\xa0 It speaks to a couple of different things:\xc2\xa0 one, the importance of robust military-to-military contact; being able to have the relationships and the knowledge of who you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to and who you need to talk to in times of great crisis.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say, again, each and every one of those conversations starts out with a conversation about restraint and nonviolence.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President spoke about yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think you have an impact?\xc2\xa0 Do you think those military-to-military contacts have helped maintain this restraint?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do believe they have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, following up on Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s question, and then something else.\xc2\xa0 With this military-to-military communication, was there also any communication about timelines, when the military should or could step in?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And also, with emotions so high in Egypt, realistically what is the timeline that you think that the violence will quell there -- realistically?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I know that it is in -- it is within the power of all of those involved to step away from that violence.\xc2\xa0 And I said very early on in this that the legitimate concerns and grievances of the people of Egypt are not going to be addressed with violence or by violence. And it is our hope that what we saw today we won\xe2\x80\x99t see tomorrow or Friday or into the weekend.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is going to take\xc2\xa0 -- this is not all going to be wrapped up in a matter of hours.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time.\xc2\xa0 Regardless of the amount of that time, it is tremendously important that restraint and non-violence carry the day during this important transition.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, one more domestically.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a major storm hitting this country.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk to me about the economic impact, what Americans should be expecting?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hearing power is out in some places, places are shut down, airlines are not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I would say a couple of different things.\xc2\xa0 Obviously each of the past two days the President has spoken directly with -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- directly with FEMA Director Craig Fugate on the preparations that we are assisting with across the number of states have been affected by the breadth of this winter storm.\xc2\xa0 I think you all got a readout yesterday that indicated that FEMA had coordinators on the ground across the arc in the country of where we were predicted to see that winter weather.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They spoke again today.\xc2\xa0 The President received another update.\xc2\xa0 I believe the FEMA director was going to do a briefing on camera today to talk about some of the preparations that have been had as we assist state and local entities and as we help businesses deal with the repercussions of, say, losing power or things like that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we anticipate that we could see appeals for disaster declarations, again, which come from the state level up to the federal level.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think at this point it is hard to make some broad macroeconomic determinations about the impact of this storm.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve had tricky weather for, as is the wont of this time of the year, for many weeks.\xc2\xa0 How that affects some economic statistics or hiring certainly remains to be seen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about the airlines?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any numbers just on the airlines shutting down?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to DOT and FAA for the particulars of that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously some of the pictures that you see in places that are used to dealing with pretty tough weather dealing with snow on the magnitude of 20 inches, it\xe2\x80\x99s a stunning thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President glad he\xe2\x80\x99s not in Chicago today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We did remark that -- my son gets excited any time it turns cold because he knows there\xe2\x80\x99s a decent chance that he won\xe2\x80\x99t have school.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But we did remark that I guess this is the first time in 12 years that kids have shared that same feeling across the city schools in Chicago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s checking on his house in Chicago, with the cold, the snow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a very good question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You guys have --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Rahm shoveling the sidewalk?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wave you off that answer.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wave you off --\xc2\xa0 Chuck thought Rahm was, the sidewalk outside of the -- (laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He thought Rahm was going to handle the shoveling?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ben LaBolt, if you\xe2\x80\x99re listening -- (laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Margaret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\'ve got a very quick one on Egypt and a slightly more complicated one.\xc2\xa0 The quick one is, did President Mubarak --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The Egypt is the easy one?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re both about Egypt.\xc2\xa0 The first one is, did President Mubarak explicitly commit on his call yesterday with the President to nonviolence?\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll just ask you the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll say this.\xc2\xa0 The President reiterated that any action -- any events should take place with the same restraint and nonviolence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 And as I said to Chuck, we\xe2\x80\x99ve received no indication on that call about any action that might take place.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But either he didn\'t explicitly commit to it, or you don\'t feel comfortable saying?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President reiterated our strong call for nonviolence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My second question is sort of a little broader.\xc2\xa0 Was there any debate internally yesterday about whether President Obama should come out and make public remarks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what do you hope is gained domestically from doing so?\xc2\xa0 We know internationally -- and especially the people of Egypt -- what the thrust of his message is, what he wants them to hear.\xc2\xa0 What does President Obama want Americans to hear about his leadership, about his command over foreign policy, and about why anything that happens in Egypt affects us at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I got to tell you, Margaret, that of the three scenarios that you just outlined, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not heard discussion of the first two inside of here in terms of dealing with events.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have had -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about this in here -- we have had an extremely important governmental partnership the past many years with Egypt, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about even today, providing the cornerstone for stability off of the Camp David Accords.\xc2\xa0 So I think there is a great imperative that the relationship that we have with Egypt and with countries throughout the Middle East, those are -- again, those are important relationships.\xc2\xa0 We seek to bring, again, stability and peace to that region.\xc2\xa0 And we seek to engage all of those entities in bringing about comprehensive peace to the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s -- I think that outlives any particular administration.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what people throughout the world expect to see.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I\xe2\x80\x99m taking a lot of time. But Americans are very obsessed right now about the economy, if you look at all the polls.\xc2\xa0 And I just wonder, do you think that the average American makes a connection between the fate of Egypt and the fate of the United States?\xc2\xa0 And what is that connection?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, Margaret, I don\'t think that anything that\'s happening is going to change that, whether it is their personal economic situation.\xc2\xa0 Somebody just asked about the weather, which obviously is some great cause of concern for a huge swath of this country.\xc2\xa0 But we understand what peace and stability, and we understand what uncertainty and instability bring to the global economy and to the global economic recovery.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that -- this is an administration that obviously has spent a considerable amount of time working on the storm, on Egypt, but continues probably a majority of what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to work on aspects of the economic recovery.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one of the partnerships with Egypt is with counterterrorism.\xc2\xa0 Is there concern that this situation is going to undermine U.S. security in that area?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we have, as you mention, an important partnership with them and with a number of countries throughout the region, and obviously not just that but a whole host of issues like that we are monitoring very closely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You had a financial stability --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the economic recovery, the Angelides commission issued a report giving a rather extensive description of the build-up to the crisis over the last few decades, indicating in particular the deregulation and particularly the revoking of the Glass-Steagall legislation which built a firewall between commercial banking and investment banking was the cause of the build-up of this bubble.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is, given the fact that you did not go back to Glass-Steagall, even though there was some discussion in Congress and a large number of congressmen who were supportive of that, that given to believe that the House leadership and the White House was not in favor of that -- now that the report is out, now that the unambiguous conclusions are drawn that this was an important element in preventing a crisis, would it not be feasible to go back and relook at this in order to create the kind of firewall that would be needed now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think that the steps that this administration has taken and the time that we have dedicated to the passage of financial reform and ensuring that what happened -- there are common-sense regulations that ensure that that kind of thing never happens again.\xc2\xa0 I think the report underscores that we were right to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have put into place resolution authority.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the beginnings of the Consumer Protection Bureau, the Volcker Rule, a whole host of important policy developments out of that legislation to ensure that this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.\xc2\xa0 I think the administration believes that we have taken a giant step forward in the passage of that to ensure that the impacts to our economy because of regulatory failures are not something that we see again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:14 P.M.
