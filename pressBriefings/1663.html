Brady Press Briefing Room</div> <div class="legacy-para">11:35 A.M. EST</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know we\'re a little bit early today.\xc2\xa0 Sorry to throw a monkeywrench into everybody.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is good.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Early is good?\xc2\xa0 All right.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously you all heard the President speak today about continuing his own reform agenda relating to contracting and procurement and addressing wasteful spending in our government.\xc2\xa0 We thought it would be a perfect opportunity to highlight what\'s going on at some of the agencies right now.\xc2\xa0 And so I\'m going to have you talk to Secretaries Vilsack and Napolitano about what they\'re doing at their respective departments, and they\'ll take a few questions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 It has obviously been an honor for me to serve the President in his Cabinet for many reasons, but one is his commitment to changing the way in which we do business in Washington.\xc2\xa0 He wants us to have a positive impact on people\'s lives, and in order to do that we need to focus on cutting wasteful, inefficient and unnecessary spending.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We began that process immediately with the charge from the President to do so my first day in office.\xc2\xa0 We receive weekly reports.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve asked the staff of every missionary of USDA to focus on reducing spending.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the first couple of weeks, we identified over $18 million in savings as we modernize our financial systems.\xc2\xa0 We\'re doing a better job of using modern technology to provide more transparency.\xc2\xa0 That allows us to avoid costly upgrades from older systems and provide more information on how best to manage USDA.\xc2\xa0 We\'re avoiding late payments; we\'re collecting resources that we\'re responsible to collect on a more timely basis.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re also utilizing technology to avoid unnecessary meetings.\xc2\xa0 Instead of people traveling all over the country, we are using technology to have people meet in their offices.\xc2\xa0 That has saved over $1.5 million in just the first couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 And we have begun a process, a very elaborate process of reviewing each contract -- each procurement contract, each consulting contract -- to determine whether or not contracts that have been entered into are unnecessary or improper.\xc2\xa0 We have identified a number, the most recent of which was a $400,000 consulting contract which career employees felt was inappropriate.\xc2\xa0 That contract has been cancelled.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to continue to do that every single week.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re anxious to live up to the expectations of the President and the people of this country.\xc2\xa0 This effort has energized staff, and they\'re looking at not just large items, but also very, very small items.\xc2\xa0 They recognize that people today are suffering in this country; they are looking at their budgets, they\'re trying to figure out how to reduce their spending, both large and small amounts, and they expect their government to do the same.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re happy to be part of that process.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you.\xc2\xa0 And like Secretary Vilsack, at the Department of Homeland Security we began early on identifying savings and cost avoidances that we could have to make sure that we were spending every dollar that we had wisely.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We were building on a process that I began as governor of Arizona, where we started in what we called efficiency review, and identified over a billion dollars\' worth of savings and cost avoidances -- and in our state over several years, where the state budget, all told, was around $10 billion per year.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are looking at things like fleet management, use of contract employees, employee travel and cross-training.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve already identified examples where we can experience savings of taxpayer dollars and cost avoidances.\xc2\xa0 For example, expediting frequent travelers through the ports of entry, using technology over the long haul will save costs.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the stimulus package, there was money for the land ports of entry, to enlarge them and improve them.\xc2\xa0 Rather than have both the GSA and Customs and Border Protection working separately on building plans for those ports, they are going to co-locate one contracting office.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve already identified at least $17 million in cost savings by doing that, simply for the ports that were actually included in the stimulus package.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Increased use of technology allows us to reduce cost.\xc2\xa0 For example, in our science and technology unit we recently worked with the Secret Service, with industry and others, to digitize over 9,000 different types of ink samples.\xc2\xa0 Not only will that allow us to improve our investigation of criminal and terrorist activities, but it reduces matching time for prints from days to minutes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Like the Secretary of Agriculture, we will be looking very hard at our use of consultants, of contractors.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll also be looking at improving our acquisition and acquisition workforce so that we are monitoring contracts and contract compliance as we embark on what for many are very long-term projects that need to be done over time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we look forward to working with the President and assuring the American people that the dollars that are being expended on stimulus are going where those dollars are intended, and that for the Department of Homeland Security they are going to their highest and best use.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions for these guys, anybody?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question for Secretary Vilsack.\xc2\xa0 President Obama cited a few ag subsidies in his budget that he thought could be eliminated.\xc2\xa0 How many more do you think could be eliminated?\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is an area where a lot of government reform groups have said there\'s a lot of fat that could be trimmed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 This is a time when it\'s very important for us to maintain the safety net as we look at a number of producers.\xc2\xa0 I know that I receive probably a letter or two a day from ag groups indicating the stress; commodity prices have fallen just as stock prices have fallen.\xc2\xa0 And so it\'s important and necessary for us to maintain an appropriate safety net.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you all know, budgets are about choices, and you have to make some difficult choices.\xc2\xa0 We -- the President has made a number of difficult choices.\xc2\xa0 We need to make sure that those are implemented, monitor the implications of those steps, and then take the next step in the process.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t tell you today what that next step will be.\xc2\xa0 I want to see the impact of the steps that we\'ve proposed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Vilsack, on direct payments, there\'s been the predictable backlash from some people who don\'t want that to happen.\xc2\xa0 How confident are you that it will get through as proposed?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s important for us to make the case and for the people of the country to understand that budgets are about choices and about a framework that the President has set forward.\xc2\xa0 And I think as we begin to educate folks about that framework and the choices that we had to make</div> <div class="legacy-para">-- I think it\'s a very important component of my budget that we\'re increasing resources for child nutrition.\xc2\xa0 I think Americans want that.\xc2\xa0 They want more nutritious school lunches and school breakfasts for their children.\xc2\xa0 They understand the connection with health care.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As we begin to make that case, I think we will -- we will be successful making the case.\xc2\xa0 But it is up to us to make the case, and I am looking forward to doing that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I would like to ask Secretary Vilsack and Secretary Napolitano, some of us who covered the previous administration recall the controversy about the outsourcing to the government of Dubai and the port.\xc2\xa0 Have you taken a look at any outsourcing to foreign countries, or is that increased under the reforms that you\'re laying out?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY NAPOLITANO:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have -- there\'s a process now called the CFIUS process, which identifies those sorts of issues such as the Dubai issue, for whether they do raise security concerns.\xc2\xa0 The bigger -- and that process is ongoing, and it has been ongoing for several years.\xc2\xa0 The bigger issue, however, is the amount of outsourcing and use of contractors.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Department of Homeland Security, of course, is very young, it\'s just barely six years old.\xc2\xa0 It was stood up so quickly that they used a lot of outside consultants and contractors.\xc2\xa0 One of the processes, one of the things we are going to focus on is what of that work can be done more efficiently, effectively and, indeed, more cheaply, by having actual full-time employees doing it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 The focus of USDA relative to other nations is to export American products to those other nations, so we\'re not as likely to have that kind of controversy or circumstance in USDA.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have offices in foreign countries, the purpose of which is to really promote American products in order to bolster trade, in order to create new opportunities for production of agriculture in this country.\xc2\xa0 So we are focused on that aspect.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Major.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Vilsack, you talked about a $400,000 consulting contract deemed inappropriate.\xc2\xa0 What was inappropriate about it?\xc2\xa0 And just generally, to both of you, one of the problems in federal contracting is when you cancel a contract, sometimes a contract will sue the government because they disagree with the cancellation.\xc2\xa0 How do you end up saving the taxpayers money if you get involved in protracted litigation if it\'s not for cause?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to go into great detail about this particular contract, other than to say that the career folks who watched this process unfold in the last waning days of this last administration were very concerned about the process, the connections and relationships between people receiving this half-a-million-dollar contract, and what they intended to do with the resource, which the career folks felt was unnecessary and inappropriate.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They made a very strong and powerful case to me that the process wasn\'t followed as it should have been; their input was not valued as it should be.\xc2\xa0 We put a lot of confidence in people who have been through this process before, in terms of knowing precisely how best to use these tax dollars.\xc2\xa0 And this particular consulting contract -- I\'ve looked at the details -- I didn\'t see any value to USDA from it.\xc2\xa0 I will tell you that it was rather startling to see that a substantial amount of money had already been spent on foreign travel, which, under the circumstances, we did not think was appropriate.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of litigation, I feel fairly confident on this one that we will prevail, and I\'d be surprised if it\'s questioned.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us, Mr. Secretary, who this involved and more details?\xc2\xa0 It sounds like a rather startling discovery that you\'ve made, and taxpayers probably would like to know more about it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what taxpayers need to know is that every single department of government has now been charged by the President to review in detail the nature of contracts that we\'ve entered into.\xc2\xa0 In order to do what American families are doing -- American families are sitting down today and trying to decide, how do we save money, how do we eliminate unnecessary spending -- their expectation is the government does the same.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get into details about this, but I will tell you that I think it\'s appropriate for us to do this.\xc2\xa0 I\'m glad the President has instructed us to do this, and I think we\'ll probably continue to find savings.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why not get into details?\xc2\xa0 This is government funds -- the public has a right to know, with all due respect.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 I\'m happy to share -- I don\'t want to step on protocol here -- I\'m happy to share, if Mr. Gibbs expects it to be --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Transparent?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lay it out.\xc2\xa0 I\'m all for it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Well, it involves an individual by the name of Stan Johnson who had a close connection with the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 It was a consulting contract for half a million dollars; a substantial amount of money was spent for foreign travel.\xc2\xa0 To be honest with you, we saw very little, if any, value to the USDA.\xc2\xa0 And a number of career folks were very concerned about how the process unfolded.\xc2\xa0 And had their input been valued, the contract would not have been entered into.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this like a favoritism thing, Mr. Secretary?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 You know, I don\'t know about that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I just know that there was a close connection.\xc2\xa0 It was a contract that I think was unnecessary, and I know the career people were very concerned about the way in which it unfolded.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Consulting on what issue, sir?\xc2\xa0 Consulting on what issue?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s a good question, and I can\'t answer it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we get more details from your department later?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Yes, be happy to.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Johnson have any connection to the Bush administration or the department previous to the awarding of the contract?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 I doubt that he did.\xc2\xa0 Actually, he used to work at Iowa State University.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, can you just say one thing, as far as U.S. and India relations between USDA and agriculture, in the past there was a Green Revolution in the \'60s and now they are talking about second revolution.\xc2\xa0 What\'s going on between the two countries now as far as that is concerned?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re very familiar with the circumstances of the Green Revolution.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Borlaug, an Iowa native educated in Minnesota and really a great American, was the father of that Green Revolution.\xc2\xa0 It helped to save hundreds of millions of lives.\xc2\xa0 We are now challenged as the world population continues to grow and the amount of land available to plant continues to shrink with developing communities and cities.\xc2\xa0 We are challenged to find the science that will allow us to continue increasing productivity.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I am confident, in discussions I\'ve had with a number of major agri businesses, that we are doing the science.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working hard to make sure that folks understand the safety and security that we take into consideration as this science is being developed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Production agriculture is one of the great miracles of American -- of the American experience.\xc2\xa0 Today, 125,000 farms in America today produce 75 percent of all that we eat and much of what we export.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s a challenge, but we\'re up to it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to get back to our regularly scheduled programming.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 We thank the Secretaries for coming.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Come back.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get a little bit more organized here.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s go -- yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if you can respond to some of the criticism coming from Republicans in increasing amounts and with increasing intensity, essentially calling the President, you know, a tax-and-spend administration and coming very close, if not crossing the line, of calling him a hypocrite on this idea of wasteful spending and cutting back on spending when he\'s proposing the budget that he has and the kinds of expensive programs that he is.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think my first advice would be to read the budget.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at the plan that the President rolled out and the plan that the President got through Congress for economic recovery, you\'ll see tax cuts for 95 percent of working families.\xc2\xa0 You\'ll see a plan that cuts a deficit that was completely out of control in half over four years, provides tax cuts, again, for 95 percent of working families, institutes some fairness, gets our economy going again.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is always interesting to see the religion some groups get when someone new comes to town.\xc2\xa0 I think we watched spending skyrocket over the course of the past eight years.\xc2\xa0 I think many Americans have rightfully asked what we got for that, because we\'ve not made any investments in many of the important things to lay the foundation for future economic growth -- as the President laid out in his address -- be it reforming our health care system, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, or beginning to invest in 21st century classrooms.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I would add one more thing.\xc2\xa0 If the best way to demonstrate for the American people that you\'re going to make the investments in their needs, do so honestly by accounting for paying for our endeavors in Iraq and Afghanistan, budgeting for future natural disasters, I think there\'s certainly every opportunity for any member of Congress to put forward a complete budget that demonstrates in full transparency exactly how they\'d like to see it done.\xc2\xa0 And I think it would be interesting to put some of those budgets side by side.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve encouraged them to do that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any sense in which pushing back against this Republican narrative is driving message or strategy, or even the kinds of events you might schedule here?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You decide to do an event on waste; maybe that\'s to push back against the narrative that you hear coming from these folks.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, we, in a planning meeting many days ago, decided to do -- trust me, I wish that I had more of my weekends and we were planning Wednesdays on Tuesday nights.\xc2\xa0 But, regrettably, that\'s not how we did things on the campaign, and don\'t do things now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think what may be frustrating to many Republicans in Congress is they finally have somebody in town who\'s willing to address wasteful spending.\xc2\xa0 They finally have somebody in town who\'s willing to provide a tax cut for the American people that need it.\xc2\xa0 There\'s finally somebody in town that\'s willing to undergo honest budgeting.\xc2\xa0 I guess for them it just came a few years too late.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you preview tomorrow\'s event on health care?\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what the President hopes to accomplish and how this will feed into the effort to get legislation on the Hill --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just broadly, to give you an event description, the White House Forum on Health Care Reform will take place, as you know, here at the White House tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 We expect there will be a few more than 120 participants.\xc2\xa0 The President will open the forum and participants will break out into several groups to discuss ideas on ways to reform the system, bring down costs, and expand coverage.\xc2\xa0 The President will then reassemble participants in a closing session.\xc2\xa0 And the event will be streamed on the web and broadcast on C-SPAN, as the President promised many times during the campaign.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, I think it\'s an opportunity to bring divergent views and divergent viewpoints in terms of constituencies that are represented, all of whom have a stake in health care reform -- bringing that group together to discuss how to move forward.\xc2\xa0 As I said again yesterday, the President doesn\'t go in with anything more than the notion that he hopes people will bring their ideas, whatever those ideas may be, and that they be put on the table and discussed, and that this process begin.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How involved is he going to be, and how involved is the White House going to be, in setting out what should be in the legislation?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to let the Hill take the lead on that, or are there certain things that are not negotiable?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think many of the committees on the Hill are going to take the lead on exactly what will be in health care reform.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this White House will work with Democrats and Republicans on that.\xc2\xa0 But I think there\'s maybe a tendency to get ahead of ourselves here.\xc2\xa0 This is the first -- sort of the opening argument, if you will.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to meeting with the participants and discussing their viewpoints.\xc2\xa0 This is not, obviously, going to be done overnight.\xc2\xa0 But I think this is a good first step in starting a process that the President believes is long overdue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you say to --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The whole thing -- the whole thing including the breakout sessions?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe that is true.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I have here.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you say to those who say this is overly ambitious to try to do this in a year where you\'re grappling with more immediate --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said, I -- in many ways, my response to the question of the budget -- we have waited for far too long to address health care reform, and we\'ve watched families struggle with it.\xc2\xa0 As the President said during his speech to Congress, a family declares bankruptcy and loses their home every 30 seconds because they get sick.\xc2\xa0 Businesses are struggling with the skyrocketing cost of health care.\xc2\xa0 And the budget -- our budget, state budgets, family budgets, business budgets -- are being overwhelmed by these costs.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess we could wait another few years, as families in this country have waited for quite some time, for somebody to step forward and take control and bring down health care costs.\xc2\xa0 But the President has decided that instead of waiting, as has been done before, he\'s going to step forward and try to do that starting now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Vilsack, just moments ago, spoke about saving $18 million in savings on modernizing financial systems, $400,000 by canceling a consulting contract.\xc2\xa0 And he spoke very movingly about everybody is tightening their belts in this nature and, therefore, the government needs to do so.\xc2\xa0 You probably know where I\'m heading with this.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to sign a bill, the spending bill, which contains $8 billion in earmarks.\xc2\xa0 Democrats in the Senate are now calling for the President to, if not make an effort to have it stripped in the Senate, to veto the bill.\xc2\xa0 Evan Bayh has an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t fully understand this argument that this is -- we\'re moving forward.\xc2\xa0 This bill hasn\'t even come to the President\'s desk yet.\xc2\xa0 If you guys are really serious, why not take the bull by the horns and get this stuff out of the omnibus spending bill?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me try again, what we\'ve talked about before.\xc2\xa0 This is the culmination of the legislative business from the previous fiscal year and the previous Congress.\xc2\xa0 The President is greatly concerned, and I think that shows in the efforts that he\'s taken to illuminate through transparency and accountability wasteful spending and earmarks in legislation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he put his on the Internet.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he hasn\'t asked for any in the past few years.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we can work with Congress to reduce wasteful spending in the future.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not now?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This isn\'t a legislation -- I guess -- you make it sound as if the legislation is written and it\'s just waiting for him to sign, and it\'s not.\xc2\xa0 It\'s being worked on right now on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 It\'s in the progress of being assembled.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not that he comes to office and this is outstanding business.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well -- well, it is outstanding business in the sense that typically appropriations bills are done before half the fiscal year is over.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but it\'s not too late to, like, tell Harry Reid, if you send this to me with this $8 billion ---</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think as I said before, Jake, that the President will lay out some very clear objectives on how we move forward.\xc2\xa0 There will be, over the course of the next several years, dozens and dozens of appropriations bills that cross his desk.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll change the rules going forward, understanding that we have to deal with last year\'s business.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On housing, White House and Treasury officials today laid out details on how their -- how the $75 billion housing mortgage foreclosure plan is going to work.\xc2\xa0 And one big element of that is to -- that\'s a direct response to the backlash that a lot of people had not just on cable, but a lot of people had about fearing that people who behaved badly will be rewarded.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, just let me -- before you finish your question -- I think that was the objective of the plan as the team met to create it, starting in November.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s what Secretary Geithner and Secretary Donovan spoke about at the event in which the President in Phoenix unveiled that policy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The idea of -- and I\'ve said this to many of you before --\xc2\xa0 I was struck reading drafts of the speech when the President makes very clear, this is not going to save every person\'s home.\xc2\xa0 The plan is not intended to take somebody\'s house -- or to augment somebody\'s loan for a house that they couldn\'t afford under any economic situation, good or bad.\xc2\xa0 The President laid out a plan that for the very first time offers help for those that have played by the rules and acted responsibly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\'ll let you finish your question.\xc2\xa0 But I just -- I think it\'s important to understand the objective of this plan wasn\'t written post some rant to two dozen people watching a cable show.\xc2\xa0 This was done at the inception of something dating back to November.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But now we have details of this plan.\xc2\xa0 And if there\'s any way you could walk us through how the specific details -- and I don\'t know if you\'re up on it -- I hope you are, but I don\'t -- if you could walk us through how the new details are going to keep bad behavior and bad actors from being rewarded.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think simply to apply for some of these, you have to have an updated -- your most recent tax return. You\'ve got to show in much different and more broad ways -- broader ways -- proof of income.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ve all read stories about people that wash through loans based on somebody coming to them and, without any proof or identification, saying, oh, yeah, I make -- I cut grass and I make $135,000 a year and I want to buy a $500,000 home.\xc2\xa0 And -- do what?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- cutting grass.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And somebody signing a loan agreement.\xc2\xa0 The plan that -- the details of which as you said were unfurled today, and as the Secretaries mentioned in Phoenix -- will take steps to ensure that there\'s a process by which people won\'t be able to game the system.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a cap on, as the Secretaries talked about, a cap for the amount of conforming loans, so that this isn\'t for somebody who, again, may have some means but bought a house far larger than one they could ever hope to afford.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve, I think, released the details of a plan that, again, rewards people that played by the rules and ensures that the system can\'t continue to be gamed by people who can\'t afford the house they\'re in because they never were going to be able to do that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on wasteful spending, because such a high bar has been set, will various government agencies be forced to hire additional personnel to weed out fraud?\xc2\xa0 Or is this -- are we talking about existing staff will be dealing with this?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\'s early to talk about -- the story from yesterday -- to talk about the extent to which new people might be needed in government agencies.\xc2\xa0 Obviously -- I mean, the President talked today about, in procurement reform, GAO reports that are done that identify a lot of this stuff that just are sitting around and nobody\'s acting on them.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President here obviously is proud of the legislation that was passed by Congress to help to kickstart the economy, and obviously is dedicating their resources both in that legislation and in -- the President is committed to dedicating those resources to ensure that the money -- that the American people have confidence in the way that money is spent; that contracting is done appropriately; that the money that, again, that the taxpayers have given to get this economy moving again is done in a way that they can have confidence in.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President and the entire team throughout this government are committed to.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the housing plan, will the refis and the loan modifications, will these be free to homeowners or will they have to pay a certain percentage for the loan amount?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will get some more details on that from Treasury.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the exact answer to that question off the top of my head.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on health care.\xc2\xa0 The President this morning, and you just now, talked about the state of the economy as adding urgency to the need to get this thing done.\xc2\xa0 But to what extent does that also complicate the attempt to get it done this year?\xc2\xa0 Are you worried about making changes to a big sector of the economy at a time when your economists, the CEA says that the economy should be in recovery into next year and into trying to dig out of where they are now?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think many of the people that are going to come to the forum tomorrow that represent many of those industries understand that it\'s time for, and that they understand and welcome reform.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ll see people tomorrow that may have been on different sides of this issue the last time this town was involved in a larger discussion on health care reform.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think you can all go through and see stories of those involved that -- things like businesses, that have understood that the crushing cost of health care has to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what the President wants to start tomorrow.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, the President would probably tell you this on the issue of health care, or virtually any other, that change is never going to be easy and it\'s never going to come easily.\xc2\xa0 But for far too long the attitude here I think has been, this is too hard; we can\'t do this now; we can kick this can down the road.\xc2\xa0 But if you look at -- going back to the budget question -- the way the amount of money that we\'re spending on things like Medicare and Medicaid are increasing exponentially, we don\'t have the option of kicking the can down the road.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have to take some bold steps at reform now to ensure that we have a system that works not just for the taxpayers of this government but for the families and businesses that they also are a part of.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to contracting.\xc2\xa0 Probably every modern President has talked about going after waste, fraud and abuse.\xc2\xa0 The biggest numbers cited in the budget outline are the growth in contracting under the Bush administration.\xc2\xa0 Most of that is privatization; that\'s handing over government functions, vital government functions to private contractors.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any specific goal to roll back privatization?\xc2\xa0 And does he have a companion goal to increase government employment to ramp up the capacity to do the jobs that contractors do today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, but understand that -- I think you\'re positing a bit of an either/or scenario when I think the President would tell you that there can be a both/and scenario.\xc2\xa0 Not every contract that\'s private has to be done at something that everybody realizes is an expense that\'s so grossly over what is the bounds of common sense.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you know, we can go back to -- go back to Katrina.\xc2\xa0 Go back to some of the contracts that were let around that.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Napolitano talked about the fact that DHS -- fairly new in its inception -- the President worked on this as an issue with somebody as different politically as probably could be from him in Tom Coburn, in addressing no-bid contracts and the way that contracts have been let specifically for non-emergency appropriations.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there an interest in rolling back privatization, separate from going after waste and fraud?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Without getting into sort of the catchphrases of whether it\'s privatization or increased employment on one side, I think the President takes the viewpoint that he wants to go through and identify any possible scenario in which money can be saved -- finding out whether, as he talked about today, in defense procurement, are there ways that we can do this that continue his sole mission of keeping this country safe, but doing so in a way that makes far more sense for the taxpayers that we\'re trying to protect.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Beyond cost savings, is there a goal for more government employment, and less privatization?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you\'re positing a scenario that is not the way the President looks at the problem.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- talked to union leaders about it during the campaign, right?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, but again -- again, I think you\'re setting up a scenario where the only way to save money is to hire people to do it here.\xc2\xa0 The President is not interested in a monetary shell game on contracting.\xc2\xa0 The President, as was demonstrated in today\'s remarks and by the -- what he\'s asked people in his administration to do is find that waste, cut it, and save money.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the spending bill, a moment ago you said that the President wants to change the rules going forward.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean on earmarks?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we talked about earlier, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you have any response to Steny Hoyer\'s comments yesterday?\xc2\xa0 It sounded like he was telling the President to butt out on earmarks.\xc2\xa0 He said, "I don\'t think the White House has the ability to tell us what to do."</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I saw those remarks.\xc2\xa0 I think the next sentence was, he reminded -- he wanted to make sure you all wrote down the previous sentence.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I -- the President believes the best way to reduce wasteful spending is to work with Congress in order to do that.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen through the -- out the past few years that the amount and the number of earmarks in legislation has been cut significantly.\xc2\xa0 The President believes we can do ever more and looks forward to working with Congress to ensure that that happens.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two quick questions on health care.\xc2\xa0 The outreach tomorrow sounds very similar to the outreach that -- in the run-up to the stimulus recovery bill.\xc2\xa0 We all know that most Republicans who were targets of those earlier efforts walked away feeling like they were not really -- their issues were not really taken into account.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ve already -- you may have already fast-forwarded through what they\'re going to discuss tomorrow and come to a conclusion.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I think the President might want to have that discussion before we decide whether or not it works or not.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To what extent can you -- what can you say to the people, the guests, that this time the process will have a different ending?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the different ending is in some ways up to the participants that come to the White House.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve talked about this, and I\'ll certainly do it one more time:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that outreach to those with differing opinions was a good idea.\xc2\xa0 It may not show immediate results, but the President thinks that\'s the best way to move forward.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would -- I might point out if I was a discerning reader that many media organizations represented in this august room have come back with opinion polling that shows the American people seem to agree that the President did the right thing in reaching out to members of the other party.\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to continue to do that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other quick question is, the last time you mentioned the last big major effort in health care reform -- has the White House consulted, or has there been any input from the person who led this last effort?\xc2\xa0 If not, why not?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 See Mara Liasson.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You know, I don\'t know if they have had wide-ranging conversations specifically with Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 Obviously a number of people -- there are still a number of people around that were part of that effort that can be consulted.\xc2\xa0 I think even those involved in previous efforts would acknowledge misgivings that they had about the way the process worked, and I think tomorrow\'s effort is intended to bring about a process that people can be assured is open, is transparent, and solicits the viewpoints not just of people that may share the belief of the President, but share differing or opposing viewpoints, or have different ideas about how one gets to the same outcome or conclusion.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that what\'s probably most important about tomorrow is that it\'s the beginning of a long and arduous process, but one that can be done in a way that brings all of those stakeholders together.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Major.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you just said a moment ago congressional committees will take the lead on health care reform.\xc2\xa0 But you\'ve also said from the podium that the President\'s campaign plan on health care is his general philosophical starting point.\xc2\xa0 Could you just reconcile those two?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\'re telling them to start on the basis --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll reconcile it by this:\xc2\xa0 The President isn\'t going to send a plan up in the form of a piece of legislation to start going through those committees.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to talk about how -- some goals and some outlines and principles that he and others would like to see met.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think he\'s also -- Major, you\'ve probably heard him say, if somebody shares the outcome of health care reform with him and has a better idea of how to do it, one that will save money, bring reform to the system, result in better outcomes and healthier people, he\'s more than happy and willing to look at it and sign onto it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Along the idea front -- this is a quick, lightning round -- (laughter) -- the President wants more children covered, right?\xc2\xa0 The President wants all children covered, correct?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if that -- if a mandate or a financial penalty is required to achieve that, he\'s in favor of that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\'s not get --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said so during the campaign.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 But just as I just said --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t want to prejudge even that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s important that the participants in tomorrow\'s health care forum have a chance to come and discuss those ideas.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\'s flexibility on something he campaigned on, in this regard?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President will welcome many people tomorrow to the White House to begin the long process of health care reform and welcomes all of their ideas.\xc2\xa0 And as I just said, if those ideas result in an outcome that\'s a better way of doing it --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But ideas have to follow the outcome sought.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just asking if the outcome sought by the President to have every child covered and if they can\'t be covered without a penalty, is he in favor of imposing one -- because he said he was during the campaign.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And as I said, let\'s have that discussion.\xc2\xa0 I think it would be -- let me -- I\'m going to bring Ed back into this -- I think it would be a little premature for the President to invite a bunch of people to come down and tell everybody what the outcome is --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you said to us --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, hold on, hold on.\xc2\xa0 I know, hold on --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- many times from the podium that what he said during the campaign matters.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can I interrupt during the lightning round?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if the lights go off and I get a little bit longer yellow from somebody in the back of the room that might control those lights.\xc2\xa0 Before we get into -- luckily, the President isn\'t going to do a lightning round tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 The President isn\'t going to stand up there with a slide show or a Power Point and say, yes, no, no, yes, yes, no -- and then ask 120 people to come discuss the outcomes in which he\'s already decided.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes and understands that there are many ideas to get to this solution.\xc2\xa0 Some of them have been discussed by people that agree with him; some of the have been discussed by people that disagree with him.\xc2\xa0 The hope is to get all of those people in the room and talk best about how to get to the ultimate outcome of reforming our health care system, reducing those costs, expanding the access that\'s available to millions of Americans, that will hopefully result in far better outcomes.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the goal tomorrow.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President want every adult covered?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he\'ll cover that tomorrow.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President support the arrest warrant issued today against President Bashir of Sudan?\xc2\xa0 And how is the administration planning for the possibility of retaliation as a result of this against Darfurians, a possible collapse of the peace in the south, and international workers in Sudan?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- without getting specifically into this, the White House believes that those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable; that as this process moves forward, that we would urge restraint on the part of all parties, including the government of Sudan; that further violence against civilian Sudanese or foreign interests is to be avoided and won\'t be tolerated.\xc2\xa0 The President and this White House are determined to support the pursuit of an immediate cease-fire and long-term peace in the region.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are many efforts that are ongoing in the region to help those that have been displaced, and the President believes those efforts should and must continue.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he does support the ICC\'s --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to go farther than what I just said.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically back to the earmarks, as Jake was asking, why will this not make it more difficult to, next year or in subsequent years, to keep earmarks out of the bills, if the President is allowing it now?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think -- as I said, I think the President will outline ways moving forward that he thinks are the best set of practices for the dozens and dozens of appropriations bills that will come his way over the course of his presidency.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he find any of these specific projects in this bill hard to swallow at all, or is he just --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that the President has looked through the bill to enumerate the specifics of the --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, briefly on contracting, where did the $40 billion figure come from?\xc2\xa0 Did he get an agency-by-agency breakdown on that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me double-check on that.\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s figures on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he\'s convinced that he can get -- continue to get those savings even after he has instituted these new rules, that they\'re going to continue to turn up more places --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s no shortage of -- as I said, I think there\'s no shortage of IG and GAO reports that demonstrate ways that we can more efficiently bring about reform in this government, and better ways to ensure that the money that\'s spent on behalf of taxpayers is done so in a way that isn\'t wasteful.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what -- and again, that\'s not just an endeavor in this budget or in defense procurement, but is also important in the President\'s recovery plan and in many of his ideas moving forward.\xc2\xa0 We are struggling with a massive budget deficit.\xc2\xa0 Everybody is going to have to make tough choices and we\'re going to have to find far greater efficiencies in how this government operates.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President support line-item veto?\xc2\xa0 It was introduced again in Congress today.\xc2\xa0 And did he support it when he was a senator?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can certainly check on what statements he made when he was a senator.\xc2\xa0 The legislation that Senators Feingold, McCain and Congressman Ryan talked about today, I don\'t know that the White House has reviewed -- again, certainly legislation that might go through Congress and give him certain or increased powers as it relates to that is something that Congress will have to deal with.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he want the power?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President wants is to be able to -- as he outlined today -- with Democrats and Republicans, work with Congress to reduce the amount of wasteful spending that we have each year.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the best way to go out and do this, to continue to look for the inefficiencies and the waste, to follow prescribed solutions for this that in many cases have been identified and just simply not acted on.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he does not want line-item veto power?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I should never have let Major do the lightning round.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mara.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask a question about the bank bailout.\xc2\xa0 But I want to follow up on Ann, because he\'d be the first President I think ever who didn\'t want it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that would be really something if he didn\'t want it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exactly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will certainly ask him if he\'s asking for it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He talks of going through the budget line by line a lot, and he can\'t really do that unless he has the veto power.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, but there\'s also --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said he wanted to take it out for a test drive.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and like I said, he wouldn\'t turn it down.\xc2\xa0 Whether or not you can find something -- I mean, obviously, the\xc2\xa0 -- you see the specifics of how the proposal was rolled out today.\xc2\xa0 It\'s different than what was done in the mid to late \'90s that the Supreme Court ruled wasn\'t constitutional.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, if it\'s constitutional, obviously.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, that little Constitution thing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Yes, obviously, I don\'t want to -- I guess I should have been more clear that we seek to take only constitutional ideas out for said test drive, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask my question about the bank bailout.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve been asked this before, but it\'s been three weeks since Tim Geithner said that he\'d be back with details when he had them, and he didn\'t want to rush out with them just to get them wrong --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, hold up, Mara.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know -- did you do a story yesterday on the business and lending initiative from the Treasury?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, that\'s one piece of it.\xc2\xa0 But what I\'m asking about in terms of toxic assets and in terms of the kind of comprehensive plan that a lot of people in the business community have been waiting for, I\'m wondering if you could explain -- you know, there\'s been a lot of theories put forward as to why he hasn\'t -- either he doesn\'t have enough help at the Treasury because he doesn\'t have the staff, or because it\'s just simply so complicated and tough to do, or because they don\'t want to bite the bullet of having to nationalize some of these banks.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering why so far we\'ve seen this ad hoc approach, a little bit more for Citi, a little bit more for AIG.\xc2\xa0 Should we expect at some point a comprehensive, detailed proposal about how to do this?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- let me flood your inbox as soon as I get done from here with many of the things that the Secretary has talked about, as I said, including yesterday, an effort to increase consumer and business lending in conjunction with the Fed and private investors that when fully implemented will result in a trillion-dollar lending capacity.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ll also send you the updated home foreclosure details that many on -- many of those businesses, I believe, share the belief that is a great cause of what we see each day.\xc2\xa0 I guess</div> <div class="legacy-para">--</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But specifically on the toxic assets --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that they\'re continuing to work on, as he outlined, the public/private partnerships.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously -- and as I mentioned this yesterday, I think there\'s\xc2\xa0 -- there are some that would like us to come in on a constitutionally approved white horse and take all the bad assets at the value in which some people believe those assets are worth but the taxpayers might not agree with that value.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the Treasury Department, the Fed, the FDIC and all those involved have continued to work on and institute increased financial stability to get -- to loosen up credit and lending in order to get our economy moving again.\xc2\xa0 I think we took a big step forward yesterday and today on those proposals, and I think we\'ll see results.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Republicans are criticizing the White House for engaging in the Rush Limbaugh issue.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to raise a somewhat separate issue on this, as well, because --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Don\'t engage me, because then I get criticized.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you and the President have used the term "cable chatter" a lot.\xc2\xa0 You guys have kind of derided that.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve also said -- I\'ve heard administration officials deride sort of superficial food-fight political reporting.\xc2\xa0 But you\'ve repeatedly engaged from the podium here with CNBC reporters, as well as Rush Limbaugh, which seems to feed that very process you\'re criticizing.\xc2\xa0 It seems a little hypocritical.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It may be counterproductive.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\'ll give you that.\xc2\xa0 Look, are there days in which I just turn my television off?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I wish I had a radio -- maybe I should just hook my iPod up.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, there are days in which, yes, your head throbs from listening to arguments that aren\'t necessarily centered on delving into some important issue, but finding two people at completely opposite ends of the spectrum to yell loudest in a seven-minute segment before we go on to something else.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shouldn\'t the White House lead the way, then, in elevating the discourse?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t see the speech.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that the President saw it; I don\'t know that anybody at the NSC saw it.\xc2\xa0 I think, as the President said yesterday, we share a very special relationship with Great Britain, and we face many common challenges, whether it\'s dealing with the economy and financial regulations, or our commitment in Afghanistan, or making the energy that we use cleaner for our children.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an agenda that they talked about yesterday and one that we think, as part of the special relationship, we can make progress on.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 12:28 P.M.
