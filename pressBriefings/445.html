CDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me just do a little thing at the top and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to your questions.\xc2\xa0 In a couple hours, the President will deliver remarks at the Paramount Theater here in Austin where he\xe2\x80\x99ll be introduced by Kinsey Button, a young woman from -- a college student here in Austin, who like some of the other folks that the President spent time with this week, wrote him a letter about her middle-class family\xe2\x80\x99s struggle to get ahead.\xc2\xa0 The President will also give folks an update on the progress we have made in taking action to expand opportunity for families like Kinsey\xe2\x80\x99s over the past six months.</p>\n<p>In January, the President said that 2014 would be a year of action, and in the first six months of this year, he\xe2\x80\x99s signed more than 40, 4-0, executive actions to support workers, strengthen middle-class families, and expand our economy.\xc2\xa0 Those actions include steps to create new manufacturing jobs, support workplace flexibility and equal pay, cut carbon pollution, and make student loans more affordable for borrowers to repay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many folks outside of Washington stepping up to do their part -- from governors and state legislators and even companies that have raised the minimum wage to the tech sector that\xe2\x80\x99s committed resources to help expand digital learning for more of our classrooms.\xc2\xa0 Yet time and time again, despite all this action from states across the country, Democrats and Republicans, and from private sector business leaders, Republicans in Congress continue to block votes on key issues in favor of wasting time and taxpayer dollars on political stunts like suing the President for doing his job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But they won\xe2\x80\x99t stop the President from doing everything in his power to keep expanding opportunity for all Americans.\xc2\xa0 And he has said many times that he is happy to work with Congress if they\xe2\x80\x99re willing, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t wait for them if they aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKinsey and the other letter-writers that he has met this year are a reminder that concrete steps taken by the President can and will benefit middle-class families all across the country.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear more from the President on that today.\xc2\xa0 But with that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, Germany is expelling the CIA Station Chief over these spying allegations.\xc2\xa0 And I know you guys have been reluctant to talk about this because it\xe2\x80\x99s an intelligence matter, but some of the frustration in Germany seems to be over the fact that the U.S. is taking sort of a nonchalant approach to this.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping you can provide us some kind of reaction in response to this decision from the Germans.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, it\xe2\x80\x99s precisely because we do take these intelligence matters and reports related to purported intelligence matters into our broader national security very seriously that I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to comment on them.\xc2\xa0 Again, any sort of comment on any purported intelligence activity would place at risk U.S. assets, U.S. personnel, and the United States\xe2\x80\x99 national security.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just not in a position to comment on it.</p>\n<p>We do continue to be in touch with the Germans at a variety of levels, including through law enforcement, diplomatic, and even intelligence channels.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in touch because we recognize the value and the strong partnership that exists between the United States and Germany.\xc2\xa0 That partnership covers a variety of issues, including national security and intelligence-sharing matters.\xc2\xa0 So we value --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a pretty extraordinary step for the Germans to take -- to expel the CIA Station Chief from Germany.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to talk about any intelligence matters, including some of these reports. As we discussed in the context of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Afghanistan a couple of months ago, even matters related to the activities of intelligence officials even in leadership positions in countries overseas, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not in a position to talk about from here.</p>\n<p>So, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to come away from this exchange thinking that we take this matter lightly.\xc2\xa0 The strength of our national security relationship with Germany is important to American national security.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also important to the national security of the Germans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have this open dialogue with them in a variety of channels to resolve this situation appropriately.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to the specifics of these reports about purported intelligence matters, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not in a position to comment on them in settings like this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying over and over again that U.S. and German cooperation has been strong.\xc2\xa0 Are you still able to say that in light of today\xe2\x80\x99s developments?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m still able to say that there is an important, functioning national security relationship and intelligence-sharing relationship between the United States and Germany.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that that relationship persists is because it is so important to the national security of Germany and to the national security of the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President talked to Angela Merkel or have any plans to, to try to smooth things over?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, they spoke last week before the German law enforcement officials made the announcement of the arrest that I\xe2\x80\x99ve read about in reports.\xc2\xa0 Those reports emerged the day after the President spoke to the German Chancellor.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule about future calls with the German Chancellor, but they speak pretty frequently.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls to tell you about right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t called her?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any calls that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the last couple of days, since the last call that we read out at the end of last week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So since then there haven\xe2\x80\x99t been any --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If there is a call, will you read out?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee that we\xe2\x80\x99ll read out every call that the President does, even with the German Chancellor, but we have often read out those calls.\xc2\xa0 And, again, if we\xe2\x80\x99re in a position to do that about a future call that, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know is scheduled, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you able to say whether there would be any tit-for-tat reaction on our part to this move by the Germans?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to offer any reaction, either in terms of articulating our position or previewing any actions that we may or may not take.</p>\n<p>Questions on other topics?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, on the supplemental, is the President open to negotiating over the size and scope of the border request?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has articulated -- and I think he did when he spoke to you last night -- a willingness to work with Republicans on this request.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to recognize, however, that the request that was put together by this administration and sent up to Congress earlier this week does reflect a lot of the priorities that Republican members of Congress have themselves articulated.\xc2\xa0 So everything from funding to ensure that public health concerns are addressed, to additional resources on the border, to additional immigration enforcement resources in the form of immigration judges and ICE prosecutors -- all of these were things that Republicans say should be used to address the urgent situation on the border -- all of these things are included as line items in the proposal that this administration has put forward to congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think that is why you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President yesterday say that we can solve this problem if there are people on Capitol Hill and the Republican Party who are actually interested in solving the problem.\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99re interested in just talking about the problem and trying to capitalize on what they may perceive to be a political advantage, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to make this pretty hard to solve.\xc2\xa0 But if there is a willingness to set aside partisan differences and focus on specific solutions to problems that everybody agrees exists, then we should be able to get that done. And the President said if Congress is ready to act quickly the President would be willing to sign it is as early as today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in the worst case scenario that, say, this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it, do you have enough resources to sort of muddle through? What is your plan if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, right now there have been some steps that the President has been able to take to address this situation.\xc2\xa0 There are already resources that have been moved from the interior to the border.\xc2\xa0 The Deputy Attorney General who was on the border yesterday talked about the tangible impact of some of those steps.\xc2\xa0 The administration has been in close touch with Central American leaders to try to stem the tide of this migration at the source.\xc2\xa0 So there are a number of things that can be done and we\xe2\x80\x99re working through them already, but I think everybody acknowledges that this is a serious problem and that additional resources would contribute in an important way to addressing it.</p>\n<p>So, again, if Republicans are actually interested in solving this problem, there is a very specific step that they can take today to back up that talk with action.\xc2\xa0 But, again, if they\xe2\x80\x99re much more interested in playing politics and dragging their feet even on a common-sense proposal, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to make this problem a lot harder to solve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it right that HHS is now having to, like, raid the Refugee Resettlement Fund in order to pay for some of the costs it\xe2\x80\x99s incurring to house and care for the young migrants from Central America?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of sort of how they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to meet their obligations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More generally, are you shifting resources from other needs in order to meet this?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t have infinite resources.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true, and I think there is a concern that that could happen.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to say from here whether or not that has already happened.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure HHS officials could explain to you how they\xe2\x80\x99re mobilizing the resources that have already been mobilized and what impact that has on their other activities.\xc2\xa0 But there is a clear and urgent need here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward a very specific line-item proposal for what additional resources are needed and how much money those additional resources would cost, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked Congress to act on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 House Republicans are working on their own proposal to revise the 2008 law.\xc2\xa0 Are you amenable to some of the things that they\xe2\x80\x99re discussing, or are you not wanting to revise the law in the way that they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think as a general matter we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly open to discussions about ways that law enforcement officials can better enforce the law -- that is to say, how can this law be enforced in a more efficient way.\xc2\xa0 Right now, what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is a backlog in the immigration court system that, in some cases, leads to a very long delay in claims being adjudicated.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also seeing a delay in repatriating those individuals whose claims have already been adjudicated in a way that determines they have no basis, legal basis for remaining in the country.\xc2\xa0 But there are a couple other ideas that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to address and we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to work with Congress to find solutions to them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward this idea that the Secretary of Homeland Security should be able to exercise some additional discretion in enforcing that law, but if there are other people that have other ideas for how to make the process of enforcing the law more efficient, we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly open to those discussions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on Ukraine, there\xe2\x80\x99s been some criticism from the Hill that the sanctions are a paper tiger because there have been threats of further action but no further action taken.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to that criticism?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think I would respond to them in a couple of different ways.\xc2\xa0 The first is that our goal throughout this crisis has been to support a democratic Ukraine that is stable, secure both politically and economically, and able to determine its own future.\xc2\xa0 So even as we work toward a sustainable, bilateral ceasefire, and urge Russia to deescalate and cease support for the separatists, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget that our ultimate goal is not just a temporary halt to violence.\xc2\xa0 We want Russia to stop destabilizing its neighbor and allow the people of Ukraine to come together to make their own decisions about their country\xe2\x80\x99s future through the political process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, frankly, in the view of the United States, the more we let the Russian-backed separatists and Russia draw out the crisis, the more vulnerable Ukraine will become.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the protracted conflict in the east is not compatible -- and when I say the east, I mean eastern Ukraine -- is not compatible with our efforts to support a more secure, stable, and democratic Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 That would be a situation that\xe2\x80\x99s not in the best interest of Ukraine, it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the best interest of Europe, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the best interest of Russia.</p>\n<p>So let me say one more thing about this, which is that we\xe2\x80\x99re working in a coordinated fashion with our European partners because it\xe2\x80\x99s our belief that the cost of inaction now only increases the cost of what we might need to do in the future should Ukraine fail due to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s continued efforts to destabilize the country.</p>\n<p>Now, many of those efforts, as you point out, have related to our efforts to impose economic costs on Russia.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that sanctions and the uncertainty that they have created in the Russian economy have had an impact.\xc2\xa0 And as those sanctions increase it\xe2\x80\x99s not just that the costs will increase, it\xe2\x80\x99s that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s ability to mitigate those costs will be affected in a negative way for the Russians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If you just look at the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s economic analysis, they\xe2\x80\x99ve said that the concern about possible escalation of sanctions has increased the uncertainty of doing business in Russia and is having a chilling effect on investment there.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one tangible way we can sort of evaluate the impact of sanctions.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe IMF, in the context of that analysis, has actually downgraded Russia\xe2\x80\x99s growth outlook to 0.2 percent this year.\xc2\xa0 That stands in pretty stark contrast to previous IMF forecasts, which as recent as February were projecting 2 percent growth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The other thing that we have seen is reports of a pretty significant capital flight from Russia and, again, that is the result of the economic isolation that Russia has experienced as a result of the sanctions that have been imposed by the United States in coordination with our allies in Western Europe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I think some of the criticism from the Hill and other places is that when we were in Brussels in June, you guys set a fairly firm deadline on additional sanctions if Russia didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet certain conditions.\xc2\xa0 They haven\xe2\x80\x99t met those conditions.\xc2\xa0 That deadline passed and there\xe2\x80\x99s no sign that sanctions are coming.\xc2\xa0 So doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that send a message to Russia that these threats might just be empty?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I think it sends a signal to them that they should be concerned about the fact that continued efforts on the part of the Russians to destabilize the situation in Ukraine will lead to greater economic isolation and increased economic costs.</p>\n<p>The United States, in concert with our allies, stands prepared to act, if necessary.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand the goal that we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not just pursuing a temporary halt to the violence -- although we\xe2\x80\x99d certainly welcome that.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that Russia understands that the United States and the international community will not stand by as they continue to try to destabilize the political situation and the economy in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is the resolute view of the international community and it\xe2\x80\x99s why the prospect of sanctions remains on the table.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s why, as recently as earlier this week, the President had a telephone conversation with the President of France to discuss this issue; he was talking to the German Chancellor at the end of last week about this issue.\xc2\xa0 So the prospect of additional economic costs being posed onto Russia is something that remains very much on the table.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have anything on these reports about Chinese hackers tapping into U.S. government personnel files, or trying to?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Only that I would suggest that you reach out to OPM and DHS regarding the incident.\xc2\xa0 DHS, as you know, is responsible for a lot of the monitoring of the cybersecurity threats.\xc2\xa0 As those two agencies have said, as soon as they learned of a possible intrusion, they took steps to assess and mitigate that intrusion -- I think they have said -- but if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it -- for the incident that you\xe2\x80\x99re referencing, we have no reason to believe that personally identifiable information was compromised.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, again, this is part of a -- we have systems in place to deal with these kinds of threats and intrusions, and I know that those systems responded to this incident.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t10:45 A.M.
