CT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 This is our gaggle.\xc2\xa0 Today our guest stars are Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes; and Senior Director at the National Security Council for the Western Hemisphere is also with us, Mr. Restrepo, Dan Restrepo.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Ben will start.\xc2\xa0 Dan will also have an opening statement, and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand back here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Let me just give you a couple updates and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go through the schedule.\xc2\xa0 And then Dan can make some other comments about Chile and the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\xc2\xa0 First of all, at 9:40 a.m. today on the plane, the President had a one-hour secure call with Tom Donilon, Bill Daley, Hillary Clinton, Bob Gates, Admiral Mullen, and General Ham.\xc2\xa0 He got a briefing from Admiral Mullen and General Ham about the status of our military operations, what took place overnight, and the planning that they are doing going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He got a review from Secretary Clinton about the status of our coalition-building efforts, the diplomacy associated with the enforcement of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973, and the work that we are doing, again, as we support this effort on the front end and look to transition to a lead role for our coalition partners in the coming days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President, again, was able to receive those briefings and have a discussion with his national security team.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After that call, the President did a call with Tom Donilon, Bill Daley, John Holdren, and John Brennan to get an update from John Brennan and John Holdren on the situation in Japan.\xc2\xa0 On this call, the President got an update about the developments at Fukushima, and our ongoing efforts to inform American citizens in Japan and provide them with support, as well as our ongoing efforts to support the government of Japan as it copes with this very difficult situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll point to what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing today, and then turn it over to Dan to make some other comments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After we arrive -- and you saw this in the guidance -- but there will be an arrival ceremony, and then the President will move into the bilateral meeting with President Pi\xc3\xb1era of Chile.\xc2\xa0 And Dan can speak to the issues that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be going through.\xc2\xa0 Chile is obviously a very close partner of the United States.\xc2\xa0 We cooperate on a range of issues and have a free trade agreement with them; work together through regional organizations like APEC.\xc2\xa0 So Chile is a good and strong partner of the United States in this part of the world, and therefore this is a good opportunity to renew our efforts with them on a range of issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following the bilateral meeting, there will be a press conference with the two leaders.\xc2\xa0 After the press conference, the President will go and deliver a speech at the Centro -- Dan, you may have to give the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

RHODES:\xc2\xa0 There you go.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for the assist.\xc2\xa0 This speech will be not just about Chile.\xc2\xa0 This is a speech to the broader region.\xc2\xa0 And this is meant to be the President\xe2\x80\x99s signal speech about his Latin American policy in his first term.\xc2\xa0 He will review the range of efforts that we have ongoing across the region in a number of areas and our vision for both the region and the U.S. role in the region.\xc2\xa0 And Dan can speak a little bit more to that as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very honored that the speech will also be attended by all the former presidents of Chile, as well as --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

RESTREPO:\xc2\xa0 Lagos, Frei and Aylwin.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So then the last piece of the day is tonight President Pi\xc3\xb1era will host an official dinner for the President and Mrs. Obama.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan, you may want to tee up Chile and the speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RESTREPO:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 Picking up on the themes that you saw over the course of the last two days with the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit in Brazil, Chile is another strong partner in the -- for the United States in the Americas but also a global partner working on a series of issues.\xc2\xa0 This is the first formal bilat that the President will have with President Pi\xc3\xb1era, but they have interacted on the margins of several important international meetings -- at the last APEC summit, at the Nuclear Security Summit last year in April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Picking up on that, Chile will host a regional follow-up to the Nuclear Security Summit in May.\xc2\xa0 So the presidents will be talking about that.\xc2\xa0 They will be obviously talking about the trade relationship between the two countries, as well as the work that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing together to advance the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xc2\xa0 Chile is one of the founding countries, one of the P4 that started the Trans-Pacific Partnership process in motion and has been a key partner in moving it forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also on the agenda will be a series of issues related to disaster response and enhancing the cooperation between the United States and Chile and other partners in the Americas.\xc2\xa0 Chile has a wealth of hard-earned experience on disaster response.\xc2\xa0 As you all know, it had a very significant earthquake 13 months ago.\xc2\xa0 Our FEMA and its counterpart in Chile have been working and will be intensifying that work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also Chile is playing an important role in following up a Council of the Defense Ministers of the Americas proposal that the United States and 13 other countries put forward last November when Secretary Gates went to Bolivia for that meeting on the military support for civilian response to disaster relief in the Americas, building on the shared experiences in Haiti.\xc2\xa0 Haiti will be a topic.\xc2\xa0 Chile is a very key member of the U.N. stabilization mission in Haiti, MINUSTAH.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday Haiti had the second round of its presidential elections, and so the two presidents will talk about the path forward and the importance of the international community continuing to work to support the Haitian people as they recover from last year\xe2\x80\x99s devastating earthquake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also on the agenda will -- I think you also get a regional -- Chile has gained prominence or is more engaged in regional policy and the President will have an opportunity to exchange views with President Pi\xc3\xb1era about the integration efforts in south America, about regional security issues in Central America, where the Chileans are stepping up and playing a greater role.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many of those same themes will carry over to the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech later in the day, where he will, as Ben noted, lay down the -- his approach to the Americas, recognizing the significant advances that have been made but the also significant challenges that remain for the people of the Americas and countries of the Americas, both on inequality and overcoming historic inequality; strengthening democracies in the region; and addressing the key challenges that face the countries and people of the Americas, be it on citizen security, be it on climate and energy -- climate change and energy security, be it on promoting greater economic and social inclusion -- all areas in which Chile is a leader.\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons that we chose Santiago as a venue for this speech is exactly that, that these are issues where the Chilean experience and the consolidation of Chilean democracy over the last 20 years plus its leveraging of its global commercial relationships to benefit an increasing -- increasing sectors of Chilean society, hold lessons for countries in the Americas and countries around the world in light of unfolding events.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re good on overview and I think we were going to take some questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, on Libya, reports confirm today that Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s compound was hit by artillery.\xc2\xa0 Wondered if you could comment on that?\xc2\xa0 What does that mean in terms of the nature of the mission, if they\xe2\x80\x99re specifically targeting him?\xc2\xa0 And is there evidence of civilian shields being used in Libya right now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 On that specific targeting question, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the best person to answer it.\xc2\xa0 I think the Pentagon can go through the targeting list better than I can, as well as the targeting list both of the United States and of our coalition partners.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will say that, again, the target list that we have pursued has been based upon protecting Libyan civilians and establishing a no-fly zone, thereby taking out things like air defenses, things associated with air defenses, anti-aircraft, as well as air assets by Qaddafi, in addition to forces that he had around Benghazi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But with regard to the specifics, I think the military would have the -- should be the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is part of the mission -- is taking Qaddafi out part of the mission?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve said this a number of times, that there are very clearly defined goals for the military operation that we are undertaking.\xc2\xa0 It is to protect Libyan civilians, stop the advances of Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces on cities like Benghazi, enable the establishment of a no-fly zone, and enable the provision of humanitarian assistance to the people of Libya.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those are the express purpose of the military mission, which is enforcing U.N. Security Council 1973, which is about protecting the Libyan people, which is not about regime change.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And human shields?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 With human shields, certainly -- we are aware of Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s -- the potential that he may engage in that kind of action.\xc2\xa0 You saw Admiral Mullen speak to it I think yesterday morning.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we have specific information but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something we watch closely because we anticipate it\xe2\x80\x99s a tactic that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a tactic that would be consistent with how Qaddafi has acted.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what would the coalition\xe2\x80\x99s response be if you can -- if you are able to establish the existence of human shields?\xc2\xa0 Are you not going to bomb these places?\xc2\xa0 Presumably you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to bomb them if there are human shields there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously in anything that we do we take great care to avoid any civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d leave it at that.\xc2\xa0 And certainly we undertake to be as careful as we can in our military operations to ensure that there are not civilian casualties.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure others will want to talk about Libya, but can I ask about Yemen?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been reports of a senior member of the military coming out and declaring support for the protesters.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States concerned that this could escalate the risks of violence and confrontation in Yemen and further destabilize the situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think in Yemen you saw some changes in the government that were made yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I think our view is that there\xe2\x80\x99s clearly going to have to be a political solution in Yemen that includes a government that is more responsive to the Yemeni people.\xc2\xa0 That has been our consistent message to President Saleh.\xc2\xa0 John Brennan actually spoke with President Saleh yesterday to discuss developments in Yemen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our concern in the immediate term has been with the violence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in recent days.\xc2\xa0 You saw the violence that took place with people being fired upon from rooftops a number of days ago.\xc2\xa0 We communicated to the Yemeni government that that kind of violence is unacceptable; that people who engage in that violence need to be held accountable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in terms of how the situation will develop, we just continue to underscore that a political solution that leads to a government that is more responsive to the Yemeni people is going to have to be the way through this situation, not violence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to the specific question of some guy who has power to command tanks and artillery siding with the protesters, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to whether that\xe2\x80\x99s going to exacerbate the risk for escalation and destability?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, I mean, these are -- in Yemen as it in other countries, these are very fluid situations.\xc2\xa0 There have been a number of changes in the Yemeni government.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly aware of the statements made by this general today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But again, I think that our message to everybody involved is that this should be channeled into a political dialogue in pursuit of a political solution and a government that is responsive to Yemenis; that, again, an escalation of violence is not in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether the President has been briefed on Yemen or was briefed on Yemen today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Every morning, it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that his updates include not just Libya and Japan but also the situation in Yemen and other countries across the Middle East and North Africa that have been facing some of the similar issues with regard to protests.\xc2\xa0 And I know Yemen was a part of that briefing this morning.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more, about the issue of -- you have talked about being able to pass over the operation or the leadership of the mission, the no-fly mission, to international partners in a matter of days or weeks.\xc2\xa0 Have you gotten any idea of how many days or weeks it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take to be able to hand it over?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve consistently said about this is that we have a unique set of capabilities that we are applying now on the front end that is going to enable the establishment of an effective no-fly zone, for instance, the efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99ve undertaken to take out air-defense systems, air assets, that have led, in effect, to -- we have not seen, for instance, Qaddafi using air assets against his own people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And similarly we had capabilities that together with our partners we could apply to protect Libyan civilians in population centers like Benghazi that had been under assault.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are going to transition this to an international coalition in terms of having the longer-term enforcement of a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 Right now we\xe2\x80\x99re in discussions with our partners about the nature of that transition, the nature of the command structure that will follow on from the actions that we\xe2\x80\x99re undertaking right now.\xc2\xa0 We anticipate, again, that that command structure will include our European allies and will take place, we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, in a matter of days, not weeks.\xc2\xa0 So I would stick to that timeframe.\xc2\xa0 I mean --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A year is days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 What?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A year is made up of days.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there any --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, well, I think the temporal point is, yes, this is not going to be a couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 This is going to be a period of days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So sooner than weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen Qaddafi using air assets against the Libyan people since the no-fly --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Not since we began our military operation.\xc2\xa0 The Arab -- we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to talk to the Arabs.\xc2\xa0 I think you saw a positive statement out of the GCC meeting, today, for instance, about the UAE and Qatar and their commitment to being a part of the international coalition.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still working with these countries to determine what the nature of their contributions will be to the enforcement of the no-fly zone over time, but we obviously see them as an important part of the coalition.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran and Bahrain, the Bahrainians yesterday said that they had uncovered a foreign plot.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States aware -- and this was clearly aimed at Tehran -- is the United States aware of any evidence of Iran trying to foment trouble with the Shia community in Bahrain?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think that what\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that the protests that originated in Bahrain were by the Bahraini people, and that led to the series of events that continues to play out.\xc2\xa0 So we believe that these movements in some of these opposition forces are longstanding political parties, for instance within Bahrain, have contributed to the protests there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That said, I think across the region, Iran always seeks to find ways to exert influence.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not unique to Bahrain.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Iran and countries like Lebanon, for instance, and others, seek to exploit opportunities for their own interests.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s something we watch very closely.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to spell out in precise terms what we think their role might be in Bahrain other than to say that we always monitor these types of situations for Iranian efforts to try to take advantage of situations for their own interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you seem to be waving us away from it a little bit by pointing out that the opposition has been there for a long time.\xc2\xa0 These people haven\xe2\x80\x99t just suddenly arrived from Iran.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that seems to be the thrust of what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying by emphasizing that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that it cuts both ways.\xc2\xa0 On the one hand, it is very clear that there is a longstanding indigenous opposition in Bahrain that is comprised of organized political movements and that they have been, again, the actors who have been most responsible for protests and organizing protests.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the same time, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly fair to say that Iran would seek to try to take advantage of any situation in the region that it thought could to redound to its benefit.\xc2\xa0 So we do take very seriously the risk of Iranian meddling and we\xe2\x80\x99ll just monitor it closely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan, quick question?\xc2\xa0 In Chile, there were protests yesterday with some people demanding that the President acknowledge and even apologize for the role that the U.S. may have played in the overthrow of Allende.\xc2\xa0 Is that issue likely to come up?\xc2\xa0 How will the President address the role that the U.S. may have played leading up to that and during the Pinochet regime?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RESTREPO:\xc2\xa0 As you\xe2\x80\x99re all aware, there was several years ago declassification of documents from that era.\xc2\xa0 Those documents remain available to the public and obviously have been reported on and written about at great length.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the focus of the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments both I think in the context of the bilateral relationship and in the hemisphere is, as you heard yesterday, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard in previous occasions, understanding the events of the past but focused on the challenges of today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the successful pieces of democratic transitions in particularly the -- particularly in Chile, has been accountability processes of -- within countries themselves.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. has been supportive of those, will remain supportive of those accountability processes, because they are a vital piece of a stable transition like the one we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Chile.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President will certainly speak to the lessons from the Chilean democratic transition and for Chile\xe2\x80\x99s defense of democracy today in helping embattled civil society around the world, both in the context of the bilateral discussions with President Pi\xc3\xb1era and in the context of his speech on the Americas policy writ large.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any acknowledgment of a U.S. role in the past, though?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RESTREPO:\xc2\xa0 I think the President in his statements at the Summit of the Americas, if you go back and look, was very clear on -- that the United States has not always lived up to its ideals in all aspects and that understanding the shared history of the Americas but not being prisoners to the shared history of the Americas; that the people of the Americas today want and need governments to move forward in partnership to deal with the challenges before people today on economic inclusion, on energy and environmental issues, on solidifying democracy in the region, on citizen security, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99re focused and there\xe2\x80\x99s where the President will be focused in his comments today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Still no miners on the schedule?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

RESTREPO:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see in the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments today, speech today, that we very much have a coherent policy toward the Americas.\xc2\xa0 And this President has had one from the beginning of his administration, again, focused on working in partnership with countries throughout the region on the challenges of today, with an increasingly capable set of partners in the region to work on citizen security issues, economic and social inclusion, energy and climate issues, the common defense of democracy.\xc2\xa0 And also we have an increasing set of partners in the Americas that we can work with on the global stage.\xc2\xa0 You saw that in the engagement over the course of the last two days in Brazil.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll see it again today, both in the bilateral context with Chile and in the multiple international fora where the President finds himself with leaders from the Americas -- in the G20, at APEC.\xc2\xa0 It is -- at the Nuclear Security Summit, the Major Economies Forum.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are multiple engagements by this administration, by this President, with leaders from throughout the Americas working on the key global issues.\xc2\xa0 I think some people fall into a trap of separating the Americas out from the world.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do that, and his policy and his global engagement has very much been -- or engagement with the Americas has been very much a part of his engagement with the world.\xc2\xa0 You see that with this trip and the actions that have led up to it and what will follow from it.\xc2\xa0 And I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll very clearly lay out his policy to date in moving forward in the Americas.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
