GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Any questions today?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Cool.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Feller, take us away.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what kind of loss it will be for the White House when Rahm leaves and how you plan to deal with it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Resisting the temptation to comment on --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I got a little caught in the rain.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- Jake\xe2\x80\x99s wet T-shirt contest impersonation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut let me say this, Ben.\xc2\xa0 I know there\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Always keeping it classy.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of stuff out there.\xc2\xa0 I will say this -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve got no personnel announcements today, but I will say that the President will have a personnel announcement tomorrow at 11:05 a.m. from the East Room.\xc2\xa0 We will save the specifics for then, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to get into a long conversation about that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any news on that to make --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why the charade?\xc2\xa0 I mean, everyone knows what this is about.\xc2\xa0 Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you just tell us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lynn, I read your paper.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve read a number of papers.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m here to tell you the President will have a personnel announcement tomorrow, and at that point he will deliver that news.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the chief of staff told the President that he\xe2\x80\x99s leaving?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is this raising to the level -- sometimes you make personnel announcements just by paper, you make a release.\xc2\xa0 Why is this announcement rising to the level of a personal announcement by the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- without getting into what the announcement will be --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When people listen to this, this will sound like a game since we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Rahm Emanuel\xe2\x80\x99s departure to run for the mayor of Chicago.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lynn, come up here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You should brief, and we can -- look, guys --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to move the ball along here.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We all have deadlines; I understand that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to talk about a whole host of subjects today.\xc2\xa0 I am not going to move a whole lot on what I\xe2\x80\x99ve already said.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the news report is accurate that he is leaving to run for mayor of Chicago.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am not running for mayor --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about Rahm.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ms. Compton.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he also possibly have two announcements -- somebody coming, somebody going?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would be -- would bet on having two announcements, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we hear from the personnel?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Some of them, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you answer Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question, though?\xc2\xa0 If he were to leave, what effect would that have on the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t do hypotheticals, Chip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More broadly, a lot of people are leaving -- Orszag left, Romer left, Larry\xe2\x80\x99s leaving, Rahm is leaving.\xc2\xa0 There are reports about General Jones; Secretary Gates has said 2011 is a good time for him to leave.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of people -- key members of the national security team, key members of the economic team.\xc2\xa0 Could you just comment on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this a number of times.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think two years in, if you look back historically, is a time in which people have come into government service at the beginning of an administration and leave to go back to academia, or business, or to retire, or go into other pursuits.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is in many ways the normal rhythm of an administration to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have -- I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this to a number of you all.\xc2\xa0 Folks that have worked in here for the last two years have managed to pack four or six or eight or 10 years\xe2\x80\x99 worth of work into those two.\xc2\xa0 The economic team has dealt with the type of -- a series of crises, from housing to financial stability to the Recovery Act to unemployment -- I would point out -- done so in a way -- if you look at the news today on AIG, we are -- if the common stock that the American government holds in AIG were sold today, that investment would net the federal government $20 billion.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs probably as late as a year ago, most people presumed that AIG would be a $180 billion loss, and the financial sector would cost the government a great deal of money.\xc2\xa0 The financial sector, as a portion of TARP, is likely to provide a profit for the government in terms of its investment.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think, Jake, in many ways it is the natural course of the way this town works and that administrations work.\xc2\xa0 People have given of their time and of their lives.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been away from their loved ones, their families -- a number of people that you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 I know Larry moved here while his family stayed in Massachusetts, and I think, in many ways, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s the normal cycle and course of doing business.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it abnormal to stay longer than two years?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No -- look, I mean, everybody has -- look, in Larry\xe2\x80\x99s case, there were -- there are tenure issues, which is not something that can just be waived.\xc2\xa0 So I think in many ways, look, some people will stay longer, some people will leave.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s largely -- I think it is much more of the normal course and the rhythm -- you look at NEC directors -- you look at somebody like -- you mentioned Secretary Gates who has -- who served the last part, I think it was the last two years of the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 And I hope Secretary Gates doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get mad at me for telling this story, but I remember being backstage during the transition when President-elect Obama saw Mrs. Gates and shook his new Defense Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s hand and looked at his wife and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s a sacrifice that is borne by people like that that is -- that just comes to fruition.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about press secretaries?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They have an amazing stamina.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No announcements on that, either.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just tell us -- I think it will help everybody out -- what Pete Rouse means to his role that he\xe2\x80\x99s played, and tell us little about --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will talk broadly about Pete.\xc2\xa0 Look, Pete is -- don\xe2\x80\x99t roll your eyes, Ms. Sweet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to talk about Pete, who is in line for what?\xc2\xa0 So Pete will -- I mean, this is part of what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, can we cut through the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be oblique, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Ms. Sweet.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you -- because you are so intricately connected to sources throughout this White House, I feel like I am encumbering you very little in the reporting of your information.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tRight?\xc2\xa0 The snickers are because what I just said was very true.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wish.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, I wish.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, Pete has been with Senator-elect, Senator, President-elect, and now President Obama.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a complete loyalty and trust with somebody like Pete.\xc2\xa0 There is -- Pete\xe2\x80\x99s strategic sense has played a big part of the direction of virtually every big decision that\xe2\x80\x99s made inside of this White House.\xc2\xa0 So I think the type of trust that the President and others throughout this administration have in Pete is enormous.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the norm is normally after the midterm elections.\xc2\xa0 When you talking historically in the norm -- people leave during this two-year period -- it\xe2\x80\x99s normally after the midterm elections.\xc2\xa0 So this is not necessarily the norm or the natural process.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April, I disagree.\xc2\xa0 Well, in the event that the chief of staff were to leave, I assume it would be because of, say, fairly extraordinary circumstances --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Like running for mayor --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- like if the mayoral race in one of the largest cities in the country were to happen to be an open seat.\xc2\xa0 So, look, but I think if you look at people like Dr. Summers and others are not -- they\xe2\x80\x99re here through the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 The notion somehow that Larry is not up there right now doing work is just not true.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does the President see these departures as an opportunity to bring in some sort of fresh blood that might have a better relationship with Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say we -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a process to pick a new replacement for Larry.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we filled the directorship at the CEA and --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is that a consideration, looking -- during a time when the city is so divided?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think what the President wants most from his economic team is the best economic advice that a President can get.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a policy process that has to be run and there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole host of things that have to be taken into account along with that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, will the President\xe2\x80\x99s personnel announcement tomorrow include an endorsement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and a couple of questions non-staff-related.\xc2\xa0 Would the President sign the House currency bill that landed on his desk?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the degree to which inside of here that legislation has been evaluated.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it has at least another step -- well, at least one more step to go in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President discuss yesterday his concern, as he has in the past.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Secretary Geithner express it.\xc2\xa0 I think lawmakers on Capitol Hill share the same serious concern that the President and Secretary Geithner have.\xc2\xa0 It is -- we have said for quite some time that the currency is undervalued and that reforms need to be undertaken.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- again, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- in a, as Dan said, in a divided town, I think there is a seriousness of concern about this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does that mean -- the President has said frequently that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about China\xe2\x80\x99s currency.\xc2\xa0 Would he sign this particular bill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any clarity on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just the last follow-up, on AIG, did I hear correctly -- did you say you\xe2\x80\x99re expecting to make a profit on the AIG investment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, what I said was if -- where the value of the -- they\xe2\x80\x99re converting preferred to common.\xc2\xa0 It obviously is going to take some time to register to get into the system and ultimately to be sold.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a process that happens, given the volume, overnight.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you took what we owned and what we possessed in common, and sold it at this morning\xe2\x80\x99s price, that represent -- that would have represented a profit on the full amount of $180 billion invested in AIG that represent a $20 billion profit.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, at his economic daily briefing today, got some -- got an update both on AIG and as -- the waning hours of the TARP program.\xc2\xa0 But, again, it was talked about how, you know, I think the estimate -- the mid-session review estimate for TARP was a deficit cost of $349 billion.\xc2\xa0 I think right now the briefing that the President got had that number at under $50 billion.\xc2\xa0 And I think that number is likely only to improve as -- with money from auto companies.\xc2\xa0 The financial sector itself will produce a profit.\xc2\xa0 And again, the AIG money, if the common were sold today, would represent a profit of about $20 billion.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 David Axelrod said something that the President has been saying for a long time, which is that Republicans are holding the middle-class tax cuts hostage.\xc2\xa0 As I understand it, Democrats haven\xe2\x80\x99t introduced a bill in the Senate and the Republicans have.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t there have to be a bill that Republicans are threatening to block or blocking before anything is being held hostage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what bills have been introduced in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, I think the posture of -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the bill would have to be the existence of -- I think the rhetoric alone from Senator McConnell and others have been that the price of -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a $700 billion price tag on moving forward on the tax cuts for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the tax cuts for the wealthy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the posture is enough, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be actual --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And look -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- I said this -- it\xe2\x80\x99s now been a couple of weeks, obviously, but we agree on the middle-class part of this or so they say.\xc2\xa0 Their price tag for the middle class was the $700 billion.\xc2\xa0 We could have passed the middle class alone, provided some much needed certainty to the economy and to middle-class families and had -- still had plenty of time to debate the $700 billion price tag for the other cuts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not do that?\xc2\xa0 Why not introduce the bill --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not get Republicans on the record?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and force Republicans to filibuster it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They were unwilling to do that.\xc2\xa0 They were unwilling to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can introduce a bill is the point.\xc2\xa0 You can introduce the bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Guys, my original answer was I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the bill is the existence of the fight.\xc2\xa0 It is that -- look, John Boehner said --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not even -- you\xe2\x80\x99re not even fighting with them.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But John Boehner said quite clearly on Sunday that he would go along with the middle-class stuff, right?\xc2\xa0 Then fury rained down, and quickly we crawfished back over to, wait, wait, wait, middle class -- the price for doing middle class is tax cuts for the wealthy.\xc2\xa0 And we could have done middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the real problem the fact that there are Democrats who agree with Republicans on the issue?\xc2\xa0 There are 47 --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we could have done middle class, but the Republicans weren\xe2\x80\x99t interested.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t need the support of the Republicans in the House to pass anything.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, but to play along with your -- if a bill has to become -- you got to pass them in both houses, and you are not going to get 60 votes to go and just do middle-class tax cuts, were you?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but I guess my question is, why not try?\xc2\xa0 If you actually think that this is a winning campaign issue --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because the Republicans were -- Republicans said they weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to do it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know unless you --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, you -- come on, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but, I mean --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You were under the impression there were like six Republicans that were going to break?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but there were Republicans --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have to have a bill --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- there were Republicans who have walked back on unemployment extension.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in order to get them -- why not introduce the bill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The existence of the bill isn\xe2\x80\x99t the -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t some great starting line for this debate.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been debating tax cuts without -- I mean, a bill you could write on the back of a napkin.\xc2\xa0 We could -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not -- the notion that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a vehicle to do this is --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s responsible to wait until the lame-duck session to do this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do I think it\xe2\x80\x99s responsible to wait for the lame-duck session to pass middle-class tax cuts?\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I thought the Republicans were irresponsible and held the middle-class tax cuts hostage.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should Democrats stay -- should the recess be canceled at this point, postponed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The point is you\xe2\x80\x99ve pushed through --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- Chuck, when you guys are on your show debating tax cuts, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t preclude -- you didn\xe2\x80\x99t not have that debate because there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bill in Congress.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s not, like, get wrung around the pole on bill introduction semantics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the point is there certainly have been -- there has been legislation in the past that the President firmly believed in and he pushed the House to vote on it even though he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he would be able to get the votes in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 You go one step at a time.\xc2\xa0 If you believe in it that strongly, you tell the House, let\xe2\x80\x99s push this through.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s vote on this --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, Chip, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- let\xe2\x80\x99s get on the record.\xc2\xa0 Why not get on the record?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There was -- we can\xe2\x80\x99t -- Chip, look at the statements from the Senate Republicans.\xc2\xa0 This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere.\xc2\xa0 They had decided to stop middle-class tax cuts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Neither was cap and trade, but you pushed for the House to get on the record on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So all they need to do is issue a press release and you guys will back off any fight?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand your question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All they have to do is say the Republican caucus is not going to support this and Democrats will just say, oh, okay, well, then we\xe2\x80\x99re not even going to try?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, Jake, you\xe2\x80\x99re making the existence of one piece of legislation the beginning or the end of this entire fight.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a silly concept.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a bill being held hostage -- it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even been written as far as anybody knows.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, the concept of tax relief for the middle class -- does that make it any less of a hostage because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it as a bill?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, it does make it less of a hostage because there isn\xe2\x80\x99t an actual piece of legislation that anybody is trying to push.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re saying because it can\xe2\x80\x99t get through the Senate the Democrats -- the House shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t vote on it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere, Chip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that you underestimated the difficulty of getting Democrats to vote for your tax cut proposal, which is middle class but not the rich?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you weren\xe2\x80\x99t surprised that 47 Democrats said they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it unless --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many Democrats support what.\xc2\xa0 I know, Mara --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you know how many in the Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that -- all you need to know in the Senate was you needed 60 votes to get to a bill and there\xe2\x80\x99s 41 Republicans who said they\xe2\x80\x99re not going anywhere.\xc2\xa0 Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m not great in math, but 100 minus 41 does not get you to the number, bill or not, in --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that argument applies to the lame-duck session, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that, just to follow up on that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to bring it up in lame duck?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hold on for a second --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- Chip, I assume it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get brought up in the lame duck largely because we have until the 31st to make some big decisions on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel -- you\xe2\x80\x99re sending Democrats home without the opportunity for them to have said, I voted to extend the middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t give them a chance to do that and this is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mara, I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the season when you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to draw a contrast with the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Why not draw a contrast?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because, Mara, having worked on probably eight U.S. Senate campaigns, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think a candidate needs a vote to necessarily say what they support.\xc2\xa0 I think candidates are going to go home and say they support extending only the middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 I wish the Republicans would agree.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should spend $700 billion, giving $100,000 tax cuts to millionaires at a time in which we have a budget deficit like it is.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re putting them at a disadvantage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear statement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last question on this, in terms of the timing -- and there\xe2\x80\x99s been so much talk about uncertainty for businesses, they don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to plan, they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the tax code is going to be like.\xc2\xa0 These tax cuts have been set to expire for a very long time.\xc2\xa0 Why wait -- why did you wait so long to try to resolve them?\xc2\xa0 You could have had a vote on extending them any time you wanted.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a better question for somebody up on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 Mara, I think -- again, I think -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on extending the tax cuts, he has had the same position on supporting middle-class tax cuts, the middle-class portion of the Bush tax cuts, since I worked for him in 2004.\xc2\xa0 So his position has been very well known on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he ever encourage the leaders on the Hill to take it up earlier?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Robert, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it an indictment of Democratic control of Congress that not a single spending bill got passed this year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, I think there -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got judges that have sat around for 240 days that passed out of a committee unanimously.\xc2\xa0 There is a system up there that is really broken.\xc2\xa0 There aren\xe2\x80\x99t spending bills that are going to make it through the process unless you have 60 votes.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just the way it is.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven if the bill hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been introduced, that\xe2\x80\x99s just the way it is.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the way that place should run.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not what the American people want to see, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the way Republicans have acted on Capitol Hill for the entirety of the President\xe2\x80\x99s time here in Washington.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis was very clear, right from the very beginning:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to say no.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to require 60 votes to pass your nominee for head of the GSA.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to let judges languish for two-thirds of a year, despite the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made it through committee on a unanimous vote.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the way this place works now -- 60 is the new 50.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean age.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the Democratic leaders who are in charge of those two bodies have no responsibility?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, you can\xe2\x80\x99t -- we all -- the Senate is -- understand you can\xe2\x80\x99t get a spending bill through the process unless or until it goes through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And when it takes 60 votes just to get on a bill, and there are 41 people that say no, again, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a mathematician to subtract 41 from 100 and come up with the fact that nothing\xe2\x80\x99s happening.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I also ask you about Congressman Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s proposal that henceforth if you propose a new program, you have to cut a program?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, back to the tax debate, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to look at the $700 billion in spending that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they would say that\xe2\x80\x99s taxing, not spending.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well -- how does that work on the deficit?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on the question of --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no, let\xe2\x80\x99s not -- no, no, but please, Mark, let\xe2\x80\x99s not oversimplify.\xc2\xa0 We are a trillion dollars --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have to ask --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, you do.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99re a trillion dollars in debt -- or in deficit.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re way past $10 trillion in debt.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s not oversimplify.\xc2\xa0 Look, the President has supported a pay-as-you-go-program.\xc2\xa0 The President supported a three-year freeze on non-security discretionary spending.\xc2\xa0 The President has -- not because he got help from Capitol Hill on setting up a deficit commission, but had to set one -- hold on, had to set one up.\xc2\xa0 Why?\xc2\xa0 Because the very same people that proposed a deficit commission then filibustered the deficit commission.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying.\xc2\xa0 Do you support or oppose Congressman Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We would be happy to support -- as I think many people would -- paying for what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do.\xc2\xa0 Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to include the $700 billion tax cut, which if you read through the pledge, I think they came up with $16 billion to pay for a $700 billion program.\xc2\xa0 Again, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be much of a math whiz to figure out that\xe2\x80\x99s just cute rhetoric.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about the extension of the tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 What is the President telling the congressional leaders what else he wants in the lame-duck session?\xc2\xa0 How ambitious?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will get a readout of what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- what they discussed afterwards and we\xe2\x80\x99ll send that around.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but talk a little bit about the lame-duck session that you\xe2\x80\x99re --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I mean, obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s some important business that I think the President thought we were close to finishing.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously some judicial nominations that the President is keenly aware of and interested in.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a host of appointments that need to be acted on.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the child nutrition reauthorization is an important thing, and obviously the tax cut legislation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The deficit commission --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the date is of when they\xe2\x80\x99re going to come in.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a big part of the conversation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not an exhaustive list.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll get anything else that they may have talked about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Interior Department came out with new offshore drilling rules today.\xc2\xa0 Does that move us closer to lifting the moratorium?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think in many ways it likely does.\xc2\xa0 We have -- there are a series of technological and safety reforms that this administration is very serious about implementing that need to be implemented and secured prior to the lifting of that moratorium.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Salazar received Mr. Bromwich\xe2\x80\x99s report, and that is a big step forward in getting this process back online.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has -- the President does not oppose the offshore exploration for oil.\xc2\xa0 We understand that in the energy environment that we\xe2\x80\x99re in, that we -- that no single source is going to light our homes and power our cars and power our businesses.\xc2\xa0 So a whole host of different sources are going to be needed, and one of those sources is going to be offshore oil.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President just believes, after what we witnessed with BP, that we need to do this in a way that is technologically safe, technologically proven; that we are fully convinced that safety plans and worst-case scenario plans do mean exactly that; that we don\xe2\x80\x99t find ourselves facing and dealing with the situation that we spent a whole long time in the summer dealing with.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a follow-up on that.\xc2\xa0 Mary Landrieu has got the hold on Jack Lew over this issue.\xc2\xa0 First, what is the President doing to get her to lift her hold on Jack Lew?\xc2\xa0 And --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what kind of problems is it causing in preparing a fiscal 2012 budget?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The budget planning process is underway and should be underway with a director with the type of bipartisan support that Jack has gotten through two committees.\xc2\xa0 I think it is a sad day when somebody is held up with such bipartisan support with the type of experience that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, in an environment where we have to improve our fiscal picture, that that person is held up for something that is completely unrelated to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it is sad, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s outrageous.\xc2\xa0 The President -- well, Secretary Salazar met with Senator Landrieu to update her on where we are on this situation.\xc2\xa0 But I want to be clear, Roger --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tuesday -- he did Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think yesterday -- let me make sure.\xc2\xa0 It was either -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether they -- I know they met on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 Maybe it was Tuesday and not Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99ve met in the last couple days to get an update on where we are.\xc2\xa0 But, Roger, we\xe2\x80\x99re not bargaining the safety of oil drilling away for an appointment that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the cause of the type of gridlock that we\xe2\x80\x99re used to seeing in Washington.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would think people who are concerned about our fiscal picture, who are concerned about where we\xe2\x80\x99re heading in this deficit at a time of crisis would not do the type of things that Senator Landrieu is doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following up on that, is Jack Lew on the job in some acting capacity?\xc2\xa0 And would the President consider a recess appointment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, two things, as far as I know, Jack is still at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a limit to what -- after a nomination but without confirmation, there\xe2\x80\x99s a very strict limit to the amount of work he can do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as I understand it, the Senate has adjourned but are in some pro forma sessions that might make recess appointments difficult to impossible.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is the Black Farmer issue over?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, because it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been resolved.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But -- and this is a concern -- they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the window is over now because congressional leaders are going back to their districts and starting campaigning for voting, and then once we come back, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to -- if Republicans gain the seats that they believe they\xe2\x80\x99re going to gain, Black Farmers are not going to get --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, this is -- on a whole host of things that this administration and many on Capitol Hill think need to be resolved and should be resolved, and now that they\xe2\x80\x99ve left for recess, will be left for after the election.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I asked the President at the last press conference about assurances that there would -- Cobell and the Black Farmer Pigford settlement will be funded, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t give assurances.\xc2\xa0 He said he supports it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You should call Mitch McConnell.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just two questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute, but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t finished.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Rather than -- rather than 15.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was not finished, please.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I thought you were finished.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, hold on, hold on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You will come back --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s okay -- just in through the nose, out through the mouth.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I interrupted you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, okay.\xc2\xa0 Also on another issue on the NAACP, they\xe2\x80\x99re having this big protest for jobs, justice and education this weekend.\xc2\xa0 What does this White House say about that, especially as the President has been working with the NAACP and other civil rights organizations in talking about promoting jobs and making conditions right for jobs?\xc2\xa0 And they are going to have at least 80,000 out here on the weekend protesting.\xc2\xa0 What does the White House say about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, April obviously, this administration, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, the issue that this President and this administration spend the most time on is the economic recovery -- financial stability, ensuring that small businesses have access to capital so that they can expand and hire new people, creating jobs, ensuring that the Recovery Act, as we end the fiscal year, is doing what it needs to do.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been the focus of this administration from the first moments of walking in this door, and it continues to be because even as we look at data on a day-by-day basis, like GDP and unemployment claims, obviously there is a recovery that while we\xe2\x80\x99re headed in the right direction, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say, is not strong enough and not fast enough.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s frustrated by that, and the President will continue to work through that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Robert --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a report out today that the health care reform law was going to force McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s to drop coverage for thousands of workers.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been denied by the company, but it does --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I will say, Wendell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the rest of your question is, but let me interrupt you at that point.\xc2\xa0 If a story is based on the actions of a company that have been denied by the company, I would -- I think that the statement that they I think put out last evening I think is pretty clear, walks that story back to the point of not being accurate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The company said it would be seeking a waiver from a piece of the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exactly, and --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There were discussions -- look, Jonathan --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to get to.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Taking up the mantle of the editor of The Wall Street Journal, let\xe2\x80\x99s understand this -- I just want to be clear.\xc2\xa0 Read the company\xe2\x80\x99s statement -- discussions with Health and Human Services that happen all the time about different regulations that are involved in the offering of benefits to companies -- again, that happens all the time.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, the statement from McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s last night makes the notion that they\xe2\x80\x99re about to drop health care for 30,000 people not true.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is if you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned that the law has the unintended effect of raising costs by making the -- by raising the minimum standards for health care, which is what McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s is concerned about.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, again --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if you\xe2\x80\x99re not concerned about that, tell me why.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Wendell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not concerned that this story is true, because, A, the company said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, and B, the company is working with HHS as companies do --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The company said it was not going to drop coverage for these people, but it may have to incur additional cost to raise the minimum standards of health coverage.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But, Wendell, I think -- right, but I think what is important to understand is discussions like that with regulators happen all the time.\xc2\xa0 The crux of that story was whether or not that coverage was going to be dropped, and McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s said that that just simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, in the same oblique that you just talked about Pete Rouse without discussing what he might be doing, say, tomorrow or Saturday or beyond that, can you characterize the tenure of Rahm Emanuel in this White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously Rahm starts his day -- the President starts his day with a meeting with Rahm and ends it with a meeting with Rahm, just as we do as staff.\xc2\xa0 I think his leadership, his energy has helped us accomplish so much in helping our economy recover, in passing landmark Wall Street reform, health care reform, credit card reform, student loan reform -- all of the things that -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not an important thing that has happened in this administration that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to accomplish for the American people that has not involved heavily his signature.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you also just --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you brought these -- Robert, since you brought this back -- wait a minute, everybody --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wait, wait, wait --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me go to Lynn, let me go to Lynn, let me go to Lynn.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get in the middle of this Chicago thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then will you come back to me?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a little follow-up here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m standing somewhere on the bridge over the river.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now we\xe2\x80\x99re back into Rahm and you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about him.\xc2\xa0 How would you -- I know you just --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In fairness, the question was \xe2\x80\x9ctalk obliquely.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Pardon?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just go ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I know.\xc2\xa0 How -- and you just gave some issues, you just described what I think are things that you would describe as his legacy as the first chief of staff.\xc2\xa0 How would you describe his relationship, in some other terms, and his management style?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily buying into the legacy part of your question.\xc2\xa0 In terms of -- no, look -- look, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Rahm has an incredible amount of energy every day.\xc2\xa0 He is -- you go into a meeting, he has a list of what he wants to get done, he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on getting those things done, he always has ideas, policy ideas.\xc2\xa0 We were in the economic daily briefing today and he was very actively involved in discussions around the issues that we discussed in terms of the Recovery Act and TARP.\xc2\xa0 There is -- you know, look, he is -- he has been the leader of -- I mean, the title \xe2\x80\x9cchief of staff\xe2\x80\x9d in many ways says it all.\xc2\xa0 He has been the energetic, inspirational leader of us, taking the President\xe2\x80\x99s promises and agenda and enacting them into law.</p>\n<p>\n\tChristi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The East Room is very often the site of visits of dignitaries and heads of state and important visitors.\xc2\xa0 Why is this event in the East Room tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because I saw animals pairing up in the Rose Garden, based on all the rain.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Rose Garden --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Give her a serious answer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wait, wait --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I mean, the serious answer is --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- wait, the Rose Garden is also an important venue.\xc2\xa0 Why the Rose Garden or the East Room?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just say this.\xc2\xa0 The personnel announcement tomorrow will be of a significant enough stature to warrant it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, The Washington Post -- Robert, The Washington Post --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why this dance?\xc2\xa0 This is just so odd.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you find it odd, Robert?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do find it odd.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 This is the oddest thing I do every day.\xc2\xa0 But hold on, but hold on, but hold on, but hold on.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just be clear.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the strategy behind this?\xc2\xa0 Leave the glory for the President tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just be clear for all the viewing audience.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten emails from you, from you, from you, from you, from you, and from you all asking me to confirm other anonymous sources, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We broke it on Monday.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh.\xc2\xa0 Uh-oh.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just for the record.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you guys play journalism review after I leave.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lynn says she said it last week.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 See that?\xc2\xa0 Let me take a couple more questions, and let you guys --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait, wait, Robert -- no, continue, can you finish the thought?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what was the strategy -- to just leave the glory for the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to send emails back to you, to you, to you, to you, or to you today --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but the East Room --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was behind this?\xc2\xa0 Was it to leave the glory for the President tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is sort of an odd dance that you\xe2\x80\x99re going through today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, Dan.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s an odd dance that the President here makes decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Without confirming it, we all know it\xe2\x80\x99s happening tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And the President makes decisions, the President makes announcements.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to wait for the President to make that announcement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, The Washington Post reported that 4 percent of Capitol Hill staffers owe $9 million in back taxes, but White House staff tax delinquencies are nearly twice as high as on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe the Post is inaccurate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House reaction to the Human Events report that in the first 19 months of the Obama administration, the national debt increased by $2.5 trillion, or more than during all Presidents, from George Washington to Ronald Reagan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that seems to have missed a few Presidents that have accumulated a lot of debt because we -- because programs that were enacted weren\xe2\x80\x99t paid for -- wars, benefits on Medicare, tax cuts, which while isn\xe2\x80\x99t a program for program is something that affects our fiscal situation, which is why --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- pushing tax cuts won\xe2\x80\x99t be paid for, the $3 trillion --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And believes that we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford the other $700 billion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why not try to pay for them if it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the President to pay for things?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because in a time of economic uncertainty, we believe that they should be extended.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Staying on tax cuts, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t -- if 60 is the new 50, what does that say for you all\xe2\x80\x99s legislative agenda next year when the numbers are even worse for you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have all next year to talk about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:45 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
