SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for getting on.\xc2\xa0 Today we\'re going to have a conference call with some senior administration officials.\xc2\xa0 The call is on the record. It will detail the legislation that\'s going to Congress that\'s targeted at strengthening the response to the BP oil spill and recovery efforts already underway in the Gulf.</p>\n<p>On the call you\'re going to hear from Melody Barnes, Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council; Carol Browner, Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change; and Jeff Liebman, Acting Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>\n<p>I will start with Carol, who is going to give an overview of the effort, why this legislation is important for accountability, and the tools that it provides.\xc2\xa0 Melody will then go into what we\'re trying to accomplish for families.\xc2\xa0 And then Jeff will be available to talk about any additional authorities we\'re seeking for agencies and why.</p>\n<p>So without further ado, Ms. Browner.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster, which can seriously damage the economy and environment of our Gulf states and jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who live throughout the Gulf region.</p>\n<p>Since the initial explosion on the drilling rig occurred, the federal government has launched a coordinated and all-hands-on-deck, relentless response to this crisis.\xc2\xa0 No one in the administration will rest or be satisfied until the leak is stopped at the source, the oil in the Gulf is contained and cleaned up, and the people of this region are able to get back to their lives and livelihoods.</p>\n<p>BP will be paying for all costs of stopping the spill and cleaning it up.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, let me just quote Lamar McKay in his testimony just as recently as yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me be really clear.\xc2\xa0 Liability, blame, fault -- put it over here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cOur obligation is to deal with the spill, clean it up and make sure the impact of that spill are compensated, and we are going to do that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>The spill has also made it very clear that updates are needed to current laws governing the liability that companies have for any damages -- for any damage they cause while drilling and transporting oil.\xc2\xa0 The Oil Pollution Act, for instance, was passed 20 years ago when offshore exploration and production in deepwater represented a small portion of our energy supply.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>To deal more generally with the harm created by oil spills as well as to toughen and update these laws, the President is sending up to Congress a legislative package that will lift the caps on damage, increase the ceiling on the amount of money that can be expended on recovery per incident from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, and provide other authorities and funding to help the federal government respond quickly to this crisis.</p>\n<p>The legislation includes unemployment assistance, food and nutrition assistance, and help for those affected by the spill to find work, aid to fisheries and fishermen who have been severely impacted by the spill, funding to increase inspection of fish and seafood to protect the safety of the food we eat, and the establishment of one-stop shops for those in need of aid.</p>\n<p>The bill also provides funding for additional inspections and enforcement of safety regulations on other offshore platforms; and comprehensive evaluations of new policies, procedures and actions needed in light of this incident.</p>\n<p>By passing this legislation we will clear statutory roadblocks and speed assistance to those impacted by the oil spill, as well as quickly mobilize assistance should the spill become worse and BP is not settling claims quickly.</p>\n<p>While we are asking for additional funds, in some cases, the federal government will not relent in pursuing full compensation for the expenses it has occurred and damage caused by this spill. And the legislation contains provisions to help us recoup those costs.</p>\n<p>Let me now turn it over to Melody Barnes.</p>\n<p>MR. SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 I, just briefly, before Melody starts, wanted to let all of you know that momentarily you\xe2\x80\x99ll be getting a fact sheet that details some of this legislation.\xc2\xa0 So it should be coming to your inboxes shortly.</p>\n<p>Melody.</p>\n<p>MS. BARNES:\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much, Carol.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously of primary concern to the President is ensuring that we provide necessary assistance for families and individuals that are being impacted by the oil spill.\xc2\xa0 And as Carol mentioned, the legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s being sent to Congress will ensure that the federal government can act quickly to provide assistance in case the spill gets worse or in case the responsible parties are not paying claims to affected individuals.</p>\n<p>We intend to do that through a series of one-stop assistance centers, making sure that people can quickly and easily get access to the kinds of resources that I\'m about to mention, and to also ensure that there\xe2\x80\x99s no wrong door, that people won\xe2\x80\x99t be given the runaround in their effort to get assistance in their time of need.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re going to provide several different forms of assistance in the legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s being sent forward, the first being oil spill unemployment assistance.\xc2\xa0 This is modeled after disaster unemployment assistance.\xc2\xa0 It would be triggered, in this case, in the result of a Spill of National Significance.\xc2\xa0 It will provide up to 26 weeks of assistance to those who are affected, but we are doing this in a way that those who can\xe2\x80\x99t qualify for regular unemployment insurance will be able to be eligible -- so, for example, those who are self-employed, as many fishermen are, or those who may not have worked the requisite number of hours, other forms of eligibility under normal unemployment insurance assistance.\xc2\xa0 The benefit levels will be determined by state law.</p>\n<p>Another form of assistance that we are going to include in the legislation is nutrition assistance.\xc2\xa0 This is predicated on the SNAP program, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\xc2\xa0 And we, again, are providing this in the case of a Spill of National Significance, just like the unemployment insurance assistance.\xc2\xa0 But in this case, our goal is to make sure that people can access these resources much more quickly than those normally can be accessed under SNAP -- the normal SNAP program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are streamlined certification processes and also fewer eligibility factors and reduced procedural requirements.\xc2\xa0 The benefits will be provided in the same way that normal SNAP benefits are provided, through the electronic benefits transfer card.</p>\n<p>We also are including here a provision that enables the Department of Agriculture to provide food directly to states and distribute that food to those who are in need.</p>\n<p>And finally, employment assistance -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re doing this by expanding the capacity of our Workforce Investment Act training and employment programs, so the local one-stop centers. And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing this obviously at the state and local level by providing funding assistance to localities and ensuring that we can provide needed training and assistance to unemployed workers -- again, fishermen and others who are out of work as a result of the oil spill -- and making sure that those who have been laid off get the kind of training and increased occupational skills that they may need during this period of time.</p>\n<p>MR. LIEBMAN:\xc2\xa0 Nearly all of the costs that federal agencies are going to incur as a result of the spill will get charged to the responsible party, and this legislation -- legislative proposal contains additional provisions to make sure that any additional costs that are incurred because of the legislation gets passed on to the responsible party.</p>\n<p>It also -- to make sure that agencies have the funds they need to do some activities immediately, it provide some funding to agencies that need to act in response to the spill.\xc2\xa0 This includes some funding for the FDA to increase their inspections of fish to make sure that the fish American consumers are eating is safe.\xc2\xa0 It includes funding for Interior Department, for MMS, to do increased inspections of all of the oil drilling facilities that they monitor.\xc2\xa0 It includes some extra funding for the EPA to do some additional studies of the environmental impact of the spill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I want to emphasize that most, if not -- and certainly the majority of the additional costs that would come out of this legislation will get charged to the responsible party and the legislation specifically makes clear that that is the case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 When you say lifting the cap on damages, are you talking about retroactively increasing BP\xe2\x80\x99s liability, or is this for future incidents lifting the cap?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we are updating the statute to address all situations and, yes, we are lifting the cap retroactively.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there an ex post facto problem in doing that?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 No, we do not believe so, because what we are doing is updating the statute and it covers all companies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I ask if you\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to BP?\xc2\xa0 And BP swore up and down yesterday that they\xe2\x80\x99d pay everybody everything.\xc2\xa0 What exactly are you doing that would ensure that that they do that?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 BP, as you know, has said that they intend to cover all the costs.\xc2\xa0 We have told them -- we have been in meetings with them -- that we take that to mean all.\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, though, we are updating this statute as a matter of policy, as well as making sure that their commitment, the commitment by the company, that they will be held to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you give us an idea as to the timing you expect on this, and the logistics?\xc2\xa0 It will go up to the Hill today presumably.\xc2\xa0 How long will it take to get passed and what does it need to go through?</p>\n<p>MR. LIEBMAN:\xc2\xa0 We hope to get this passed as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of vehicles moving in this work period and we hope to work with Congress to get it done in the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you expect in the next few weeks that it will get passed.\xc2\xa0 Have you had any feedback already from lawmakers that indicates support or any issues that they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about?</p>\n<p>MR. LIEBMAN:\xc2\xa0 This needs passing as soon as possible so that we can get the tools in place to take care of the folks in the Gulf.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, clearly, you want it as soon as possible, but my question is, what kind of feedback have you gotten from lawmakers.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything in particular that they like or that they object to that you expect to be hurdles?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the Hill has been notified that this legislation will be coming up shortly.\xc2\xa0 As you\xe2\x80\x99re probably aware there are a number of bills that have already been introduced in both the House and the Senate, so the folks are actively engaged; hearings are underway.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do everything in our power to move this as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great, thanks, Carol.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you all for taking my question.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, you all have been tracking this very closely.\xc2\xa0 Do we have any sense of what the actual economic damages are?\xc2\xa0 Any range yet?\xc2\xa0 And if not, when can we expect such a figure?</p>\n<p>MR. LIEBMAN:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re setting it as closely as we can, but, frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s changing very quickly and it varies across the states.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t have an accurate number.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I just ask one small follow-up?\xc2\xa0 Why is there no exact figure -- just looking at the fact sheet -- in the legislation for what size or, excuse me, how high do you want the ceiling to be raised on the damages that the government can collect?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 This is Carol Browner.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to work with Congress on determining what that number will be.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there are some bills that have been introduced, but we will be working with them to determine what the right number is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was wondering if this is going to include a per-barrel tax increase to go toward this recovery fund?\xc2\xa0 Are you guys calling for that, too, or is this -- does this not include that?</p>\n<p>MR. LIEBMAN:\xc2\xa0 The legislation calls for a one-cent-per-barrel increase in the tax, both from eight cents to nine cents immediately, and then from nine cents to 10 cents when it\xe2\x80\x99s currently scheduled to go from eight to nine in 2017.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said you want to work with Congress to set a liability cap.\xc2\xa0 Some of the legislation proposed already is $10 billion.\xc2\xa0 Is that sort of the ballpark that you guys are expecting?\xc2\xa0 And can you give me sort of a total figure of the cost of this bill, and would all that be paid by BP?</p>\n<p>MR. LIEBMAN:\xc2\xa0 The total new discretionary spending in this bill is $118 million.\xc2\xa0 We expect that the overall majority of that would end up being reimbursed by BP.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the liability cap?</p>\n<p>MR. SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with Congress on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As far as, do you think the $10 billion that\xe2\x80\x99s been proposed by Congress as a cap already is a ballpark that you guys are looking at?</p>\n<p>MR. SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with Congress on it.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t have a ballpark for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was going to ask about the retroactive nature of this, but that\xe2\x80\x99s already been asked.\xc2\xa0 So I wonder if anyone could comment on the offshore drilling provision of the climate bill that\'s going to be introduced today by Senators Kerry and Lieberman.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the White House supports?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Hi, this is Carol Browner.\xc2\xa0 We applaud Senators Kerry and Lieberman for their tireless work in drafting this legislation.\xc2\xa0 We think this is an important step forward.\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe, the President believes that comprehensive energy reform is crucial.\xc2\xa0 We need a bill that will help us break our dependence on fossil fuels, create clean energy jobs, and put a cap on greenhouse gas emissions.</p>\n<p>We have seen portions of the bill; we have not seen the entire bill.\xc2\xa0 We will be reviewing it in the coming days and will continue to work in the Senate to secure passage of the comprehensive legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, hello.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One involves the $118 million in discretionary spending you believe that this legislation would encompass, the majority to be reimbursed by BP. Is this the kind of discretionary spending -- you expect $118 million each year?\xc2\xa0 Is this a repeated sort of funding situation? And the other question is going a little further on what was just asked -- do you guys -- are you able to state whether you support the legislation under Kerry-Lieberman that would allow states to ban oil drilling within 70 miles off their coast?</p>\n<p>MR. LIEBMAN:\xc2\xa0 The $118 million is one time.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Again we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be looking at the Kerry-Lieberman legislation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, in light of the situation in the Gulf of Mexico, this legislation -- the debate around offshore drilling is going to be a significant one, and so we want to take a look at it.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll be working with the Senate to see how best to proceed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk a little bit about the FDA seafood inspections?\xc2\xa0 I wonder how worried Americans should be about seafood coming from the Gulf, and whether the increased inspections will be soon enough and increased enough to comprehensively make sure no bad seafood is getting into the food system.</p>\n<p>MR. SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 That\'s probably best answered by the daily press conference happening down at the JIC every day.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot on the food safety and know -- these folks are here to talk about the legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but the legislation talks about increasing money so that FDA can do more inspections, and I just wonder whether the increase will be enough to be really sort of a comprehensive barrier against tainted seafood.</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR BARNES:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously in addition to the concerns that the President has to make sure that the families working in the Gulf are taken care of, we want to make sure that those who are eating -- eating out of our food chain and our food supply are also equally protected.\xc2\xa0 So the FDA will continue to act vigilantly.\xc2\xa0 We are providing additional resources to make sure that they are able to do so, and we will continue to do that as we monitor the situation very carefully.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 And at this point, all of the safeguards are in place in terms of the appropriate fish closures, the appropriate inspections.\xc2\xa0 And so we have no reason to think that seafood is not safe at this point.\xc2\xa0 We have to remain vigilant and I think, again, as has been said, you can get sort of a full outline of everything that\xe2\x80\x99s happening right now to ensure that the food supply is safe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, the $118 [million], that\xe2\x80\x99s the total for the bill? And do you subtract the $29 million that goes to the Interior Department for money outside?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us a break -- I know you said the majority, but is that half is paid for by BP, or can you be more specific?</p>\n<p>MR. LIEBMAN:\xc2\xa0 So the $29 [million] for Interior is a component of the $118 [million].\xc2\xa0 To the extent that a component of the $118 [million] is directly related to the current disaster, we will be able to charge it to BP.\xc2\xa0 There are some things -- for example, inspecting other oil wells in other parts of the country where we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be doing increased activity\xc2\xa0 -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to get reimbursed from the responsible party for that.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we need appropriations now to make sure we can do all the things we need to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how hard do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be to get reimbursed by BP if they\xe2\x80\x99ve already paid claims to fishermen, for example, for their damages, than paying another $15 million for unemployment, or retraining?\xc2\xa0 Is that going to be a major battle?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, we are going to, as I said earlier -- we take BP at their word.\xc2\xa0 They say they intend to pay for all costs.\xc2\xa0 And when we hear \xe2\x80\x9call,\xe2\x80\x9d we take it to mean all.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s obvious people aren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to double-dip, an individual can\xe2\x80\x99t get reimbursed one place and then attempt to get reimbursed for the same economic impact somewhere else.\xc2\xa0 But to the degree that we are using federal dollars to compensate individuals, we will claim that against BP.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks for doing the call.\xc2\xa0 If I could just ask a little more about the legislation.\xc2\xa0 You said the Hill has been notified.\xc2\xa0 Have you run it by Republicans?\xc2\xa0 Is this going to be done in like a pre-packaged way direct to the floor and out by Memorial Day?\xc2\xa0 Or does this need to go through committee and kind of get hashed out with amendments and things?\xc2\xa0 And who will introduce it?\xc2\xa0 Have you been told what committee or whatever it might go to?</p>\n<p>MR. LIEBMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to tell the exact legislative strategy, but we have in our notifications talked to people on both sides of the aisle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you got anything back from them?\xc2\xa0 I mean, okay, we\xe2\x80\x99ll look at it when you get here, or, yes, we agree to that in principle or in detail?</p>\n<p>MR. LIEBMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think there is a wide understanding that there is a strong need right now both to make sure federal agencies have the capacity they need to respond to this event and to make sure that we provide the assistance that people in the Gulf need.</p>\n<p>MR. SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 We got time for two more.\xc2\xa0 No other questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, the Mexican News Agency.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for taking my question.\xc2\xa0 I am wondering if you are considering an international dimension, specifically, the potential damage to Mexico?\xc2\xa0 Have you had any kind of contact with the Mexican government to see if they can get some reimbursement in case there is evidence of damage to Mexican waters?</p>\n<p>MR. SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 We have been in touch with the Mexican government, and I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you over to the Coast Guard, who is working with State Department on any international needs or requests for assistance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you can explain the differences between the various liabilities and the claim caps.\xc2\xa0 In your fact sheet that you sent out, you said that the funds will be raised -- the cap on the fund will be raised to $1.5 billion, the cap on the natural resources damage would be raised to $750 million.\xc2\xa0 But then you said that the other liability claim cap you want to negotiate with Congress.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain the difference of why you\xe2\x80\x99ve left that final cap on negotiations open?</p>\n<p>MR. LIEBMAN:\xc2\xa0 The first sort of cap you described are on the overall resources in the existing trust fund.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do is make sure that the Coast Guard and the other agencies responding can get access to the funds they need when they need them, rather than having to stop activities while they wait for appropriations.\xc2\xa0 And so the move -- lifting the cap from $1 billion to $1.5 billion -- and the component of that is for natural resources, from $500 [million] to $750 [million] -- is a part of that effort to make sure that the existing trust fund resources can be tapped as soon as they\xe2\x80\x99re needed to respond to this spill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s a separate issue of what the allowable damages are for the responsible party, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the issue that we look forward to working with Congress on.</p>\n<p>MR. SHAPIRO:\xc2\xa0 Thank you all for participating in the call.\xc2\xa0 And thank you, Melody, Carol, and Jeff for your time today.\xc2\xa0 And I hope everyone has a great day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n10:26 A.M.
