EDT</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Quickly, with the two bilats that the President did this afternoon -- with Lebanon, he and President Sleiman discussed our continued support for Lebanon as they go through their government formation process and deal with a very complex situation in the region.\xc2\xa0 We reiterated our commitment to the unity and stability of Lebanon and the need for all countries in the region to respect Lebanese sovereignty, and praised Lebanon\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to democracy and respect for minority rights.</p>\n<p>On Syria, the President noted our continued support for Lebanon as they deal with the refugee situation.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d note that of the $340 million in additional humanitarian assistance that the President announced in the UNGA speech, $74 million of that will go to Lebanon to deal with their refugee population.\xc2\xa0 And they also discussed our shared commitment to reaching a political solution inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 The President also noted the need for groups like Hezbollah to respect Syria\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and to not interfere further in the civil war there.</p>\n<p>The President also expressed our support for the Lebanese Armed Forces.\xc2\xa0 You heard him announce some additional assistance we\xe2\x80\x99re providing.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work with the Lebanese Armed Forces as they promote the stability and unity of the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And they also discussed other regional issues, in particular the Israeli-Palestinian issue and our pursuit of a peace agreement, which obviously Lebanon has an acute interest in given their Palestinian refugee population.</p>\n<p>Then, in the bilat with President Abbas, I\xe2\x80\x99d just first of all note that the majority of the meeting was a one-on-one discussion between the two Presidents.\xc2\xa0 President Obama praised, as he did publicly in his speech, President Abbas\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to pursue Middle East peace through direct negotiations with Prime Minister Netanyahu -- acknowledged the hard choices that President Abbas has made in putting aside shortcuts to peace through the United Nations that we do not believe can succeed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He encouraged President Abbas, as he has Prime Minister Netanyahu, to move quickly in those discussions so that the two sides are addressing the final status issues of security and borders, and refugees, and Jerusalem.\xc2\xa0 Again, the point being that we have a window of opportunity here with direct negotiations, and the quicker that they get to the hard issues, the greater likelihood there is of success.\xc2\xa0 The President committed to staying in close contact in support of those discussions, and also noted that Secretary Kerry of course will continue to play a lead role in that peace process.</p>\n<p>And then, just -- well, with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just take your questions on anything else.\xc2\xa0 The speech you saw -- I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to talk about that.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in Iran, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you go over the situation with Iran?\xc2\xa0 You cited some complications earlier that prevented a meeting from taking place.\xc2\xa0 Can we get a little deeper into that?\xc2\xa0 What are the internal dynamics that you encountered?\xc2\xa0 How did you hear about this?\xc2\xa0 Was this from a third party -- the Swiss, for instance?\xc2\xa0 Any other details you can provide?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, first, let me step back and -- we believe that the new Iranian government under President Rouhani does present an opportunity to make progress on a diplomatic negotiation; that they\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated a seriousness that we had not seen under the previous government.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s precisely because of that that Secretary Kerry is going to be meeting with the P5-plus-1 and Foreign Minister Zarif, which is a uniquely high-level meeting for the United States and Iran to be participating in together.</p>\n<p>We indicated to the Iranians the same thing privately that we said publicly, which is that President Obama is open to a discussion with his Iranian counterpart.\xc2\xa0 We did not intend to have a formal bilateral meeting and negotiation of any kind.\xc2\xa0 This would have rather been them having a few minutes to have a discussion on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly.\xc2\xa0 That was done at the staff level directly with the Iranians, so not through any intermediary.\xc2\xa0 Particularly here in New York, it\xe2\x80\x99s not difficult to communicate directly to the Iranians, as they\xe2\x80\x99re coming to UNGA.</p>\n<p>In terms of complications, I think our assessment is while President Rouhani has been elected with a mandate to pursue a more moderate foreign policy towards the West and to pursue negotiations -- in part to achieve sanctions relief -- the issue of the relationship between the United States and Iran is incredibly controversial within Iran.\xc2\xa0 You heard the President speak to it today -- the decades of mistrust between our countries.\xc2\xa0 And I think that from the Iranian side, for them it was just too difficult for them to move forward with that type of encounter at the presidential level, at this juncture.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue the negotiating track through our foreign ministers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When did these conversations begin?\xc2\xa0 And when did you guys get final word that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen?\xc2\xa0 Was it before the President addressed the Assembly this morning, or after?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having these contacts, I\xe2\x80\x99d just say, while we\xe2\x80\x99ve been here in New York.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note we never would have contemplated any kind of formal bilateral meeting, but were open to an encounter discussion on the margins.\xc2\xa0 It became apparent that that was not going to happen today after the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, because that\xe2\x80\x99s the window of time when he was going to be over at the U.N.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d also underscore -- since we came into office, one of the reasons that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to maintain international unity among the P5-plus-1 and other countries, and build the sanctions regime that we have in place, is because the United States has indicated our openness to diplomacy with Iran, so that the issue in play is not whether the United States is being recalcitrant in refusing to negotiate, but whether the Iranians will do so.</p>\n<p>So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to continue to demonstrate to the world that even as we see positive indicators from President Rouhani, that those words needs to be followed by actions.\xc2\xa0 And there is still clearly need to do more work in order to create the basis for not just a negotiation, but the type of encounter that we were contemplating today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you just were able to hear any of Rouhani\xe2\x80\x99s speech -- he just finished up -- and a lot of the things that he said are pretty similar to the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from Iranian leaders in the past.\xc2\xa0 He blasted U.S. sanctions.\xc2\xa0 He defended Iran\xe2\x80\x99s right to enrich uranium.\xc2\xa0 He said he was open to a process to negotiate over the nuclear program, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t give any indication of giving ground on any of the issues where the U.S. has sought changes.\xc2\xa0 Have you guys been given any indications privately they they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to take some of these steps you\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeking?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, that\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising.\xc2\xa0 Iran has a baseline set of positions that they have taken for a long time.\xc2\xa0 I think what\'s different about President Rouhani is not simply some matter of personality.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, he is not as bombastic as President Ahmadinejad.\xc2\xa0 He does not say things that are quite as inflammatory as his predecessor.\xc2\xa0 What\'s different is he was elected expressly on a mandate to pursue a more moderate foreign policy and to achieve a nuclear deal in order to achieve sanctions relief.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is the important point:\xc2\xa0 This is not something that we believe happens out of goodwill; we believe that Iran has an imperative to improve its economy, because every single economic indicator is negative for them.\xc2\xa0 The only way that they can improve the economy is through achieving sanctions relief.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the context that\'s changed.\xc2\xa0 And so if President Rouhani is going to fulfill his commitments to improve the Iranian economy, he is going to need to achieve sanctions relief.\xc2\xa0 That can only be achieved through a meaningful negotiation and agreement with the international community.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s what I think gives us a sense that there\'s a basis for progress here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\'ll have to continue to test whether those indications can be followed through with different negotiating positions from the Iranian side.\xc2\xa0 That will take place in the P5-plus-1, starting on Thursday, when Secretary Kerry sits down with his P5 counterparts and Foreign Minister Zarif.\xc2\xa0 But we would not expect them to shift their negotiating positions publicly on the front end of that process, just as we would not shift our commitment to maintain strong sanctions at the front end of any negotiation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, did you go into today thinking that there was a realistic chance that this encounter was going to happen?\xc2\xa0 Or was this just sort of a diplomatic olive branch that you were extending?\xc2\xa0 Was that ever really realistic?\xc2\xa0 And then, how do you explain how the Iranians decided to say no?\xc2\xa0 Do you know whether or not Iran\'s Supreme Leader said, this is not going to happen?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we had -- the interesting thing here is that it\'s difficult for the Iranians to take this step, given their history.\xc2\xa0 And so I think we always recognize that.\xc2\xa0 It was certainly not likely that they\'d be able to get over that type of hurdle.\xc2\xa0 What we\'re in a position of saying is we want to test this diplomatic process in every way we can.\xc2\xa0 The substance will take place through the P5-plus-1 and through Secretary Kerry\'s efforts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At the same time, it\'s important for us to demonstrate that we\'re open to any type of negotiation.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, in our view, it\'s a demonstration of strength to say here\'s a new leader, he\xe2\x80\x99s had some new things to say about this issue -- we\'re willing to hear him out.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll do that at any time.\xc2\xa0 And the fact of the matter is we\'re going to continue to test this, because the achievement of an agreement on Iran\'s nuclear program, as the President said today, would address a significant national security concern in the United States and the world, and also potentially reduce tensions more broadly in the region.</p>\n<p>So we felt it was important to test today.\xc2\xa0 It was not something that we had any high degree of certainty would take place.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re going to continue to put the test to the Iranians -- because, frankly, ultimately, the onus is on them to demonstrate that this is a real change in course and a real opening.</p>\n<p>The only thing I\xe2\x80\x99d note in that regard, though, is that just the foreign minister-level meeting on Thursday is a change.\xc2\xa0 Iranian foreign ministers have not sat down with American secretaries of state in any context in a very long time.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, that\xe2\x80\x99s where the substance of these negotiations will take place anyway.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there any concern that there was -- or some risks inherent in going ahead and doing the handshake?\xc2\xa0 Because obviously it would have further rattled the Israelis, it might have bothered some Persian Gulf allies.\xc2\xa0 It might have been viewed as prematurely rewarding Rouhani.\xc2\xa0 And particularly given the tone of his speech just now, which as Julie correctly said, is not sort of that strikingly more moderate than what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard in the past.\xc2\xa0 Could it have been an awkward day for the President if he had done that handshake?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve always rejected the premise that somehow just having an encounter with a foreign leader, even of an adversarial nation, is in any way a concession.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, the very fact that they were unwilling to go forward with it demonstrates that they were the ones who had discomfort with it in terms of dealing with their own complexities back home.</p>\n<p>I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to demonstrate to the international community that even as we hear some new things from this leader, we need to stay united in the enforcement of sanctions and the insistence that Iran undertake meaningful commitments as a part of a negotiation and an agreement.\xc2\xa0 They can\'t just say different things and expect to achieve a different result, unless they actually follow through with those actions.</p>\n<p>On his speech, look, the President reiterated today our determination to prevent them from developing a nuclear weapon, identified a core interest in the prevention of nuclear proliferation, indicated that all options are available in terms of how we carry out that core interest and protect it.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m sure that\'s something that the Iranians would indicate has been something that they do not like in our rhetoric.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is these issues are going to have to be dealt with through negotiation.\xc2\xa0 And I think that we are moving with some urgency in that regard.\xc2\xa0 The Iranians have a sense of urgency, given the fact that the only way their economy can improve is through sanctions relief.\xc2\xa0 And I think the foreign minister\'s participation in these meetings indicates the seriousness with which they\'re approaching diplomacy.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we have a sense of urgency in no small measure because of our concerns about Iran\'s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that the Israelis frequently comment on and talk to us about.\xc2\xa0 We\'re in close coordination with both Israel and our Gulf allies.\xc2\xa0 I think they have recognition that it would be preferable to achieve a diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue.\xc2\xa0 They\'re skeptical of Iranian intentions -- which is understandable, given their history with Iran -- but we do see the potential for progress, certainly more so than we have in the last several years, since we had a negotiation with them in 2009.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to test that in the weeks ahead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that today was a test.\xc2\xa0 Can you say anything more about what you feel you learned today?\xc2\xa0 And also, can you talk about whether it\'s true that there were two or three Americans among the attackers in Nairobi?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 On today, I think what we learned is, as the President said in his speech, we are overcoming a significant history of mistrust, and that there are hurdles to achieving a diplomatic resolution; and that Iran has to do more to demonstrate that some of the conciliatory words that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen out of President Rouhani will lead to a different position at the negotiating table and different actions in terms of their foreign policy.</p>\n<p>Again, not surprising, but I think important to demonstrate to the world, that the U.S. is open.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. is ready to negotiate, and that the Iranians need to come seriously to the table.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that that will be the case beginning later this week, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to test this proposition going forward.</p>\n<p>On the Americans that have been alleged to have been involved, I know that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\'re talking to the Kenyans about.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any further information for you on that, but we\'re in communication with Kenyan authorities and working to establish what we can determine about any American participation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you help us understand better the complexities that you were sensing from them as to why they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to the table?\xc2\xa0 Did the Iranians ask for anything specifically of the U.S. to have a meeting?\xc2\xa0 And also, just curious to get an understanding of why you\'re briefing all of us while Rouhani was speaking.</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read anything into the latter.\xc2\xa0 We\'re just -- that\xe2\x80\x99s purely a logistical issue, so in no way timed to his speaking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the former, I think we\'re just mainly speaking to the fact that even with a different Iranian president than President Rouhani -- who has made a central part of his campaign in his initial presidency outreach to the West -- I think given the history in Iran, has difficulty in going forward with this type of encounter.\xc2\xa0 Every leader has his or her own politics, and that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the case with President Rouhani.</p>\n<p>Again, I think our view is it\'s a demonstration of strength to say that you\'ll meet anytime, anywhere to discuss how to resolve an issue.\xc2\xa0 And the President is certainly -- will continue to be willing to do that.\xc2\xa0 I think President Rouhani and the Iranian side will need to determine how they can both move forward through a negotiation that will include the foreign minister level, and then ultimately, what types of changes that they\'re willing to make in their positions in order to achieve a new relationship with the United States, which depends upon resolving this nuclear issue.</p>\n<p>So it\'s something we\'ll continue to test.\xc2\xa0 This is already a different environment, given the seriousness of the Iranian side in pursuing negotiations in the level that will be started on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect there to be an agreement reached on Thursday, either.\xc2\xa0 This is going to be a process that takes place over time, and that time is not unlimited by any stretch.\xc2\xa0 I think both sides feel some urgency.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll just continue to test this diplomatic opportunity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to be clear, did they propose anything in exchange for a handshake today?\xc2\xa0 Was there any sort of a --</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize their views too much.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously, they have a set of negotiating positions, but the fact of the matter is we were never contemplating any negotiation between the Presidents.\xc2\xa0 We were very clear in our discussions that this was not any venue, formal bilateral meeting, or nuclear negotiation; this would have been an informal encounter on the margins of the General Assembly.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely because we want to empower the P5-plus-1 process, the foreign ministers, Secretary Kerry, to be the ones negotiating substance.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President announced in his speech that Secretary Kerry will be taking the lead in terms of pursuing this negotiation with the Iranians and the P5-plus-1.</p>\n<p>Couple in the back there, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the vehemence -- I know you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the whole speech yet -- but the vehemence with which Rouhani condemned what he called "war mongering" -- he referred directly to the President\'s statement to the General Assembly -- is that enough to perhaps obtain some kind of moderation in the kind of language on the military option, for example, in future contacts with Iran?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we have a clear statement of policy, which is that we are determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 Now, we\'ve also made clear we have a preference to do that through diplomacy, but we\'re not going to change that policy simply because there\'s a new leader in Iran.</p>\n<p>Again, it\'s not surprising that the Iranian leader would condemn sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Sanctions are precisely what has significantly damaged their economy and I think invested them in trying to achieve a resolution through diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 But we are open to negotiation, open to find ways to build confidence with the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 As the President said, there\'s space for an agreement, given that both the Supreme Leader and President Rouhani have said that it is not their policy to pursue nuclear weapons, and the President has said that the Iranian people can have access to peaceful nuclear energy.\xc2\xa0 It\'s defining the space within those statements that is going to be the work of diplomats going forward.</p>\n<p>Just take a couple more there.\xc2\xa0 Yes, in the back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to ask about President Obama\'s meeting with President Abbas.\xc2\xa0 President Obama said that the border with Israel and Palestine should be based on 1967 lines with mutually agreed-to swaps.\xc2\xa0 So can you say anything about President Abbas\'s response to these swaps, either like positive or negative?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Well, I think on this issue, since May of 2011, we\'ve established that the U.S. position on territories, it should be based on \xe2\x80\x9867 borders with mutually agreed swaps.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t expect Israelis and Palestinians to publicly, in the middle of the negotiation, enunciate a position on that final status issue.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a subject for them to negotiate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We believe that the United States, having laid that out in May of 2011, can provide some baseline for that negotiation.\xc2\xa0 But again, that\xe2\x80\x99s for the Israelis and Palestinians to determine through their direct talks.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize President Abbas\'s view of the matter, nor Israel\'s for that matter, given that it\'s ultimately for them to work out.</p>\n<p>What I would say is that we do see an opportunity here.\xc2\xa0 They\'re in final status negotiations.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve already made some sacrifices and hard decisions -- the release of prisoners on the Israeli side, for instance; not pursuing the U.N. track, on the Palestinian side.\xc2\xa0 Now it\'s imperative for them to accelerate their process of getting to those final status issues and resolving them through negotiation.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the process we\'re going to support in the coming months.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry if this has already been addressed, but one thing -- is there any reason why Ambassador Power didn\xe2\x80\x99t stay in her seat for all of Rouhani\'s speech, number one?\xc2\xa0 Number two, taking another shot at Devin\'s question, was there something the Iranians wanted in return to make that handshake happen?\xc2\xa0 Was there something that they wanted to agree to behind the scenes -- not about nuclear war, not about anything like that?\xc2\xa0 Is there something they wanted that we were unwilling to give them?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 On Sam Power, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she was there for the speech.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that she was in the bilat with Foreign Minister Lavrov, which, obviously, we have a negotiation going on over the chemical weapons resolution.\xc2\xa0 But State can speak to that -- but that\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the second thing, I think our point to them -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize their side of the discussions other than to say that, in our view, this wasn\'t a negotiation over substance.\xc2\xa0 There was never going to be some type of agreement reached in the meeting in the first place.\xc2\xa0 So that wasn\'t a discussion we were having or entertaining with them in terms of what we agree -- any substantive agreement that would be reached out of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 This was more about whether or not the two leaders would get together on the margins of the Assembly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any sense of disappointment from the President that this did not happen?</p>\n<p>SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- look, the President has said for six years now that he\'s willing to meet the Iranian leadership.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\'s, frankly, not just a necessity of testing this proposition, but also demonstrating to the world that we\'re the ones who are open to negotiation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how we have maintained international unity.\xc2\xa0 Without a U.S. willingness to engage Iran, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we would have achieved the sanctions that we have.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we would have maintained P5-plus-1 unity.</p>\n<p>So it\'s important for us to continue to send that signal.\xc2\xa0 President Rouhani had sent a number of signals through interviews that he had given leading into the trip that he\'s taken to New York.\xc2\xa0 At the end of the day, though, I think we want to demonstrate that the United States is certainly open to this.\xc2\xa0 But Iran has to change its policies, not just in atmospherics but in their actions.</p>\n<p>I\'ll just close then, real quickly -- I just want to say one thing about the speech.\xc2\xa0 I would just note that, really, what the President was intending to do is provide an overview of our policy in the region for the rest of his time in office.\xc2\xa0 I think we have, in three areas, significant diplomatic work underway:\xc2\xa0 the Syrian chemical weapons issue that we\'re aiming to resolve; the Iranian nuclear program; and Middle East peace.</p>\n<p>So this is as active a diplomatic agenda as we\'ve had in the region in some time.\xc2\xa0 Of course, the Syrian chemical weapons issue, the President said, can lead into and energize a political process to resolve the situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 But I think you\'ll see this is going to be an area of very active diplomatic follow-up going forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Of course, he was also able to speak much more broadly to both the situation in the Arab world, and indicate a realism about our ability to influence events in those countries, but also a continued commitment to do what we can to support a set of principles, as well as, I think, challenging the international community to recognize that if they don\xe2\x80\x99t step up and do more to resolve these issues, that you\'re only going to see more conflict and more -- frankly, a lack of appetite from the United States to bear the burdens that other nations need to share with us going forward.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t5:49 P.M.
