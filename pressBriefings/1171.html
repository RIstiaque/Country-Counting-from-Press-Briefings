EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s get started.\xc2\xa0 Ben.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick follow.\xc2\xa0 I guess from all that, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting accomplished anything.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it was a good meeting.\xc2\xa0 It was a good meeting because the President sat down, the Vice President sat down with Speaker Boehner, Leader Reid, the chairmen of the appropriations committees, and they spoke directly and at length about what issues are on the table, what needs to be resolved.\xc2\xa0 And I think the Speaker has said that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to work towards finding a deal, and the President obviously made clear that he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s essential that we find a deal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he wants nonstop work on this -- today, tomorrow, the next day -- until it gets done.\xc2\xa0 And as he said from here, that if progress isn\xe2\x80\x99t being made on the Hill, then he wants to invite that same group of lawmakers back to the White House tomorrow, and again the next day, until we get this done -- because it is simply irresponsible and unacceptable not to finish this business when we are this close to a deal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s not willing to stay in town for the meeting tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President called the meeting today.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s a meeting tomorrow, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see when that happens and who\xe2\x80\x99s in attendance.\xc2\xa0 It will be here.\xc2\xa0 We are engaged extensively in making this happen.\xc2\xa0 The President just stood before you and said he would make every member of his team, including himself, available to the leaders on the Hill to help bring this compromise to a conclusion so we can move on to the other issues that confront us, which are substantial and, in many ways, far more significant than last year\xe2\x80\x99s business, six months left in the fiscal year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99ll cancel his trip if necessary?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chip, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement to make since the President said he will call a meeting if it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.\xc2\xa0 So I would suggest that maybe you guys want to focus on the slightly bigger picture than the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 The President just came and spoke to you about this.\xc2\xa0 He just spoke to the Speaker of the House and the Leader of the Senate, to the chairmen of the appropriations committees, and the American people about this.\xc2\xa0 I think his commitment and focus on this is apparent for anyone who was watching, both here and in the room.\xc2\xa0 And he has demonstrated his willingness to do whatever he can do to ensure that the necessary people sit down and do the necessary work in a reasonable way to reach a compromise to get the people\xe2\x80\x99s business done.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeff.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, how do you envision getting a deal if both sides are digging in their heels on the same things that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been digging in their heels on for weeks?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have made clear, as the President said, that our willingness to come to meet the Republicans more than halfway has been amply demonstrated by any baseline you want to measure it at this point.\xc2\xa0 Between zero and 100, 73 is a much more than halfway.\xc2\xa0 Between zero and 61, 33 is substantially more than halfway.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to want to work on the details to make sure that the composition of the cuts is one that we can live with and that we can all agree on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President has some very clear principles going into this about what cannot and should not be cut, and he believes that in a choice between community health care centers, or medical research, or Head Start, or education funding on one hand, or highway funds that are set aside for earmarks on the other hand, or military spending that the Pentagon has indicated is wasteful and it does not want or need -- in that choice, if those are the choices on the table, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear where he stands, and he believes that there\xe2\x80\x99s a case to made for reaching a kind of compromise, having demonstrated our willingness to come as far as we have and to make cuts in programs that we support, that we can come the final distance, the final few billion dollars, if you will, to get this work done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that a bunch, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering how -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re not moving away from that position and the Republicans aren\xe2\x80\x99t moving from theirs, how do you come together?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we come together by calling a meeting and working it out -- by meeting today, by meeting this afternoon, the Speaker and the Senate Leader -- Majority Leader, by meeting tomorrow if necessary, by meeting and continuing to work out these details.\xc2\xa0 And again, if the composition of the cuts is the issue, we have offered a number of different ways to bridge the gap.\xc2\xa0 And the kinds of cuts we\xe2\x80\x99re offering are real and substantial.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker of the House, in the meeting today, acknowledged that there has never been an appropriations bill that does not also include cuts in so-called mandatories.\xc2\xa0 One out of every 10 dollars in H.R. 1 is a cut in mandatories.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no disagreement on the fact that that\xe2\x80\x99s got to be part of this composition.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there are ways to get there, and there\xe2\x80\x99s more than one way to get there that still achieves an agreement between both sides.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that the White House has now issued a memo to agencies and departments telling them to prepare a contingency just in case there is a government shutdown, can you share with the American people what a shutdown -- I understand you are confident that it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen, you\xe2\x80\x99re cautiously optimistic there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a deal, but can you share with the American people what a shutdown would mean to them?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President I think laid out in some specifics that would happen if an agreement were not reached and the impact that it would have on small businessmen and their ability to secure a loan; on families visiting national parks; on a variety of different areas.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the week progresses, the Office of Management and Budget will make more clear to the agencies and share more details about what steps need to be taken in terms of which portions of the government would continue to operate and which would shut down.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, I will cite the Speaker of the House who said recently that a budget shutdown would cost more than it would save.\xc2\xa0 So any notion that shutting down the government for some period of time is actually a good thing because it saves money is incorrect, as the Speaker himself said.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd independent economists are out there making clear what the impact on the economy would be on the uncertainty it would create for businesses, and that would obviously be harmful at a time when we are beginning to see some real progress in terms of economic growth, sustained growth, and sustained job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we clearly do not want a shutdown.\xc2\xa0 We take leaders of the Congress, the Speaker of the House and the Senate Minority Leader at their word that they do not want a shutdown, which is why we believe that there is still reason to hope that if everyone sits down at the table and is reasonable, that we can find an agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any idea of how many federal employees would be furloughed?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have those specifics.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question.\xc2\xa0 Admiral Mullen said that the most significant threat to our national security is the debt.\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama agree?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 President -- the President certainly agrees that it is essential to address our long-term deficit and debt.\xc2\xa0 He has made clear --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he think it\xe2\x80\x99s the most significant threat to our national security?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of significant threats to our national security and certainly the economic health of this country, and one thing he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear about the need to be competitive in the 21st century is that our stature in the world, our national security, depends on our security at home and our economic security, and certainly that we are committed, the President is committed to addressing our long-term deficit and debt issues because they are so vital to our capacity to continue to grow and out-compete the rest of the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he has, as he said right from this podium moments ago to Julianna, he is looking forward to the debate about fiscal year 2012 and our longer-term budget and fiscal priorities, because he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s vital and important.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s another reason why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important to just get this business done of funding the last six months of 2011.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the question is, if it is such an urgent threat, whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s the top one or one of 10, why not just find $20 billion, $30 billion more in cuts, and meet the Republicans where they are, given that we all know that this is --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wait, wait, you -- Jake, you know better than anybody else this debate that we\xe2\x80\x99re having about fiscal 2011 is about 12 percent of the budget.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pittance.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is nothing you can do in cutting discretionary spending in anything like a responsible way that will address, will deal in any marked way with our long-term deficit and debt issues.\xc2\xa0 Everyone agrees on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is not the vehicle through which to have -- to address the longer-term debt issues.\xc2\xa0 Our entitlement programs, the tax reform we need, the tax expenditures that are an issue, the defense spending that is an issue -- that is not the box in which we are now deciding the funding for six months of the year.\xc2\xa0 But he is committed to addressing those issues, as he has made clear since his State of the Union address and he made clear when he appointed the fiscal commission last year.\xc2\xa0 And he will do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why does everything have to go down to the wire, whether we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the budget, whether we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about what happened in lame duck session?\xc2\xa0 Everything seems to come down to the wire and everyone is trying to cut a deal.\xc2\xa0 Why does it have to be that way?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would suggest that we\xe2\x80\x99re all in many ways students of Washington, and there are a lot of answers to that question.\xc2\xa0 But I think what the President made clear just now is that it does not have to come to that.\xc2\xa0 It does not have to come down to brinksmanship.\xc2\xa0 It does not have to come down to a shutdown, showdown, especially when we are this close to an agreement; that the American people expect us to be responsible, to say, you know what, I\xe2\x80\x99m going into this room and I know I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get 100 percent of what I want, because last I checked, no faction, no party controlled 100 percent of the government that -- in Congress or the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the system is built for compromise, for finding common ground, for reaching a consensus around things that serve the greater good, and in this case, reduce the deficit more substantially.\xc2\xa0 And more substantial discretionary spending cuts than have ever been proposed in nominal terms we have accepted, right?\xc2\xa0 No debate.\xc2\xa0 No debate.\xc2\xa0 Larger as a percentage of -- as large as a percentage of the GDP since any cuts proposed since 1982; no debate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think the question of who\xe2\x80\x99s for spending cuts, are we for spending cuts, are they for spending cuts -- we\xe2\x80\x99re all for spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re all for reducing the deficit and the need to address that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there is not that much that divides us on how we get there to that figure that we talked about, the $73 billion that the President mentioned, which, by the way, is the same figure which the Speaker of the House, the leader of the Republican Party in the House, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, initially proposed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when we talk about our engagement and willingness to compromise, willingness to move off our starting position, I think we have amply demonstrated that.\xc2\xa0 And we, as the President said today, are ready and prepared to meet around the clock to get this done.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why does it always have to be --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Dan, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 Why does Washington work the way it works?\xc2\xa0 Clearly it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work the way it works.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we see the White House in these situations where they\xe2\x80\x99re fully engaged, where meetings are happening, people are coming to the White House, or people from the White House are going up to the Hill at the last minute.\xc2\xa0 Why is this not happening --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Would that it were not so.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t this pressure happening early in the process so that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to come down to this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would -- as you know, the calendar of where we have come -- the conversations that led to the target figure of $73 billion happened more than a week ago.\xc2\xa0 We got there more than a week ago.\xc2\xa0 So -- and it was -- we were told that the appropriators could work it out from there.\xc2\xa0 And we have stayed engaged in -- even as that process has taken place.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t endorse this approach.\xc2\xa0 It would certainly be better for all of us, for -- and for the American people, most importantly, if we were able to do this in regular order, if we had come to this agreement two months ago, three months ago, or four months ago.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly need to come to agreement now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Athena.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked this morning about people being reasonable, and the President just spoke about the American people want Congress and the White House to act like grownups and to not be playing games.\xc2\xa0 So who\xe2\x80\x99s being unreasonable right now?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President also said that we\xe2\x80\x99re not interested in pointing fingers and blaming.\xc2\xa0 The American people aren\xe2\x80\x99t interested in that; we\xe2\x80\x99re not interested in it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re interested in getting this done.\xc2\xa0 We have demonstrated our willingness, as I mentioned to Bill today, earlier this morning, that you cannot -- whichever ruler you use, you cannot disagree with the proposition that we have come more than halfway.\xc2\xa0 You just can\xe2\x80\x99t -- unless you have a form of math that\xe2\x80\x99s not familiar to me or anyone else in this building.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we believe we are being reasonable.\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe that if we\xe2\x80\x99re reasonable and they\xe2\x80\x99re reasonable, a deal is possible.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we look forward to these -- having these meetings today, tomorrow, the next day, as necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just one follow-up.\xc2\xa0 If, as the President said, not everyone can get 100 percent of what they want, he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about some things that he\xe2\x80\x99s not willing to budge on, like Head Start positions and EPA.\xc2\xa0 What do you want to see the Republicans budge on, and what specifically are Democrats --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been specific -- I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been specific and the President mentioned also that one area that we see potential savings that we have not agreed on yet is the $600 million plus in the current Republican proposal, which is for funds set aside for transportation highway project earmarks.\xc2\xa0 We think in a choice between that and closing down community health care centers, we\xe2\x80\x99d rather see the earmarks cut; Pentagon spending that the Pentagon says -- military spending the Pentagon says it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need and is wasteful -- all things considered, we\xe2\x80\x99d rather see that cut than education, Head Start, or medical research.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So -- and then, but again, those are identified cuts.\xc2\xa0 There are also things that we have put forward as alternatives to reaching them, in Medicaid savings, for example, or other areas that are real cuts.\xc2\xa0 They can -- as the President tried to explain and did explain, that mandatories -- this is a terminology, a term of art on Capitol Hill -- but this is real money that affects real people in real ways.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re at the table and we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in doing this for the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you hope and believe it won\xe2\x80\x99t get to this, but if it does get to Friday and they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a deal, what specifically do you object to in Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for a one-week stopgap?\xc2\xa0 Is it the $12 billion?\xc2\xa0 Is it the Defense Department provision?\xc2\xa0 What specifically is objectionable about that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s objectionable is the notion that we can continue to fund the government on a turnstile --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that, but that proposal in particular.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- in turnstile, tollbooth fashion.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it is no way to run a government.\xc2\xa0 It is -- creates a lot of uncertainty for businesses and for the economy.\xc2\xa0 And it is not necessary.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to expand beyond what the President said.\xc2\xa0 What he did say is if we are -- if we have a deal and because of rules up on the Hill we need a few more days to push the paperwork through, then he would certainly entertain signing a clean CR to keep the government open while that process works for a few days.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they won\xe2\x80\x99t agree to that, we know that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we need to get the deal done then, don\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is -- had the meeting today, why he\xe2\x80\x99s calling on leaders to continue meeting and to work on this problem, and why he\xe2\x80\x99s making the Vice President and his entire senior staff available to help with that process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know you suggested it\xe2\x80\x99s not a pertinent question, but the President said if they can sort it out in today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, fine; if not, I want them back here tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Will he be here if John Boehner comes here tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me look at the schedule.\xc2\xa0 Again, the meeting has not been called.\xc2\xa0 We would --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be his hope?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He said very clearly he would make himself available for meetings and for engagement in this process, as he has up to this point.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As OMB is making contingency plans, if you will, for a government shutdown, would the President like to see as many government workers as possible deemed essential personnel, or is that a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s largely out of his --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s based on existing rules or guidelines.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the President address the issue of the number of federal workers who would continue to come to work if there were a cutoff in funding.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s guided by the numbers.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No way he can influence that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, honestly.\xc2\xa0 But I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s very much a side issue today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Middle East, any progress toward the President\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of getting an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement within, now, I guess, six months made at today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with President Peres?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he had a very good meeting with the Israeli President, which he discussed, and he remains hopeful that progress will be made and that -- because he believes firmly that the solution of having a secure Israel living side by side with a sovereign and secure Palestine is a goal shared by both sides, and that it is best reached in negotiations between the two sides.\xc2\xa0 And he encourages progress -- he encourages progress to be made on those negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But no --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No news of specifics or anything out of today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Justice Department decision to try folks at Gitmo before military commissions, the reaction to that has been critical from both sides -- the right saying you could have come to this decision a year ago; the left saying you promised you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do this.\xc2\xa0 What is your reaction, if you will, to the reaction?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, what\xe2\x80\x99s important is that the President believes that it is not helpful to remove Article III courts as a tool in our toolbox to prosecute terrorists.\xc2\xa0 Because there is not the prospect in the short term of convincing Congress to do that, to remove those obstacles, then he believes it is essential to bring the accused to justice.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for the victims\xe2\x80\x99 families and it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do, period.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he is proceeding with a military commission process, which has been reformed in a way that makes it more effective and responsive.\xc2\xa0 And he supports the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s decision to proceed in that direction.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Attorney General said he really didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the idea of trying these folks before commissions.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President agrees that Article III court -- it is not a good thing that Congress is preventing the use of Article III courts for this purpose.\xc2\xa0 And he also agrees with the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s decision that it is time -- given the circumstances we find ourselves in on this issue, it is time to move forward with prosecuting these suspects.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Keith.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any amount of progress that can be made in these negotiations that would cause the President to sign a CR?\xc2\xa0 Or are we at the point where there\xe2\x80\x99s either a deal or there will be a government shutdown?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President made very clear that if we -- if we get to a point where an agreement is in hand, but the system won\xe2\x80\x99t allow for it to be processed and voted on in time, then he would entertain a clean CR of several days to allow that process to take place.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there has to be an agreement?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve made enough progress --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t improve upon the President\xe2\x80\x99s words on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just lastly, does the White House feel that basically there was a deal with Boehner on the number and that Boehner has reneged on this deal?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have said is that -- as the Vice President said that evening on Capitol Hill that there was an agreement that $73 billion was a target that the appropriators could work off of.\xc2\xa0 We agree that there was -- until everything was agreed upon, nothing was agreed upon.\xc2\xa0 But there was an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And as I said this morning, those appropriators have been working off that principle, and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it out of thin air.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we believe that that is an instructive number because of its -- what it represents in terms of substantial spending cuts; also because of what it represents in terms of the original position of the Speaker of the House and the chairman of the House Budget [Appropriations] Committee.\xc2\xa0 And we have demonstrated our willingness to accept cuts that in an ideal world we would not support in order to reach a compromise and find common ground because nobody can get 100 percent of what they want in a process like this.\xc2\xa0 And we have recognized that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to square that statement with --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I just --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not interested in blame.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Got to raise your hand.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Can you just expand on the President\xe2\x80\x99s response to the Ryan plan and how he may respond after this budget, current budget fight is over?\xc2\xa0 On the entitlement reform, tax reform issue?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are committed, as the President has said, to reducing America\xe2\x80\x99s long-term deficit, because it\xe2\x80\x99s essential to growing our economy and winning the future.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Ryan is correct in identifying the fact that we cannot do that if we just look at 12 percent of our budget.\xc2\xa0 A narrow slice of domestic spending, cutting that will not get us to where we need to get in terms of dealing with our long-term deficit.\xc2\xa0 And that, I remind you, is what has occupied so much of our attention today and for the last weeks and months.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But while we agree on his ultimate goal, Congressman Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s goal, we strongly disagree with his approach, because any plan to reduce our deficit substantially must reflect American values of fairness and shared sacrifice.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe believe that Congressman Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s plan that he put forward fails that test.\xc2\xa0 It cuts taxes for millionaires and special interests, while placing a greater burden on seniors who depend on Medicare or live in nursing homes; families struggling with a child who has serious disabilities; and workers who have lost their health care coverage.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President believes, again, that the goal is important and he shares the goal, but he believes there is a more balanced way to achieve that goal, to put Americans on a path to prosperity, if you will.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, but despite all our differences, what the President made clear here and what we have made clear every day from this White House, and the President said in his State of the Union, we need to come together as Democrats and Republicans to tackle this issue.\xc2\xa0 There is no way that a Republican plan -- purely Republican plan or a purely Democratic plan -- is going to get through a divided Congress and be signed by the President.\xc2\xa0 It has to be a bipartisan compromise.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to resolving this issue, the six months remaining of last year\xe2\x80\x99s business, precisely so that he can engage and have that debate that he talked about moments ago.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is he saying that he -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a non-starter for the President?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99d say that we strongly disagree with this proposal.\xc2\xa0 I want to remind you, because I took this question in another form earlier this morning from you, asking about our response or -- to Congressman Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s proposal and that it is a budget -- a fiscal year 2012 budget proposal, which, by the way, the President put forward his a couple months ago.\xc2\xa0 So -- but he has recognized and said again today that we need to address these long-term deficit issues, and he looks forward to engaging in that debate.\xc2\xa0 But he believes that the plan that Congressman Ryan put forward today fails the test of balance that is essential to make sure that there are shared sacrifice in the decisions we make, and shared sacrifice as we go forward and we reduce our deficit in a way that puts us on a fiscally sustainable path for the future; allows us to be competitive and to win the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a couple more.\xc2\xa0 Jon-Christopher.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Regarding Prime Minister Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Pakistan, has the President and Prime Minister Cameron discussed a coordinated approach to the challenges that face Pakistan as they relate to the war in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve read out many times, the President and the Prime Minister have spoke -- have had telephone conversations quite frequently of late.\xc2\xa0 I do not know if they have spoken specifically about Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 But -- so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specifically in reaction to the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s trip.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s been the essence of the latest conversations that they\xe2\x80\x99ve both had in terms of --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, they spoke on numerous occasions about Libya in the process of reaching agreement on U.N. Security Council resolutions and coordinating and working together as partners in that process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back to the shutdown, possible shutdown.\xc2\xa0 The Stars and Stripes is reporting -- advising members of the military that they may be required to -- and civilians who work at the Pentagon -- they may required to come to work on Monday if there\xe2\x80\x99s a shutdown and not get paid.\xc2\xa0 Is that your understanding?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the specifics.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that uniform service men and women will get paid, but I would not take the specifics from me.\xc2\xa0 I think you ought to address that to the OMB or DOD.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has that been decided the military would --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specifics on that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that uniformed men and women will continue to get their paychecks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, all.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you just comment on Kaine announcing his plans to run for the Senate?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that right now.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s save it for tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:51 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
