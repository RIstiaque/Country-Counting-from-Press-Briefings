EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way deep into the heart of Texas, to Austin. \xc2\xa0The President is looking forward to his event at South by Southwest today. \xc2\xa0Many of you heard the conference call that White House officials did yesterday previewing the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit. \xc2\xa0But obviously, this is an opportunity for the President to talk about innovation in the tech center and the potential that has to bring about some significant changes in our government in the way that it has our economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd there were a number of announcements over the course of this week that we\'ve made from the White House that illustrate the concerted effort we\'re making as an administration to incorporate that innovation and that entrepreneurial spirit into the government. \xc2\xa0It has significant benefits for the way that government can perform for our citizens, but also in the way that we can address some intractable policy problems.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President is looking forward to this conversation today. \xc2\xa0All of you will have an opportunity to be in there to hear it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI wanted to make one additional statement on the Supreme Court before I get to your questions. \xc2\xa0On the Supreme Court, earlier this week, we saw that Senator Cornyn from the great state of Texas came out earlier this week and predicted that the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to the Supreme Court would be treated like a pi\xc3\xb1ata. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of concerns that a statement like that arouses. \xc2\xa0The first of them, frankly, is that the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even decided on the nominee yet. \xc2\xa0It sounds like Republicans are prepared to follow through on their threat to not consider the credentials or experiences or character of the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee, but rather attempt to tear that person down.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tA day or two later, we saw some interesting comments from Senator Johnson of Wisconsin. \xc2\xa0He was speaking on a conservative radio program where he acknowledged that Republicans would not treat the Supreme Court nominee of a Republican President in this way. \xc2\xa0He said -- and I have part of the quote here -- we\'ll get you the full one if you would like it -- he said, \xe2\x80\x9cGenerally, this is the way it works out politically if a conservative President is replacing a conservative justice, then there\xe2\x80\x99s a little more accommodation.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it\'s clear that Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 vow to treat the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee like a pi\xc3\xb1ata is not motivated by some sort of principle, but rather motivated purely by party politics. \xc2\xa0That\'s unfortunate. \xc2\xa0This string of bad news continued for Republicans yesterday when Senator Graham observed during the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting yesterday that what Republicans are prepared to do is without precedent. \xc2\xa0His comment was, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\'re setting a precedent here today, the Republicans are.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'ve had a lot of hue and cry in Washington, D.C. in the weeks since Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s death. \xc2\xa0That hue and cry has been characterized by a lot of old quotes being thrown back and forth. But what\xe2\x80\x99s true is that Republicans are vowing to rough up the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee without considering his or her credentials or character. \xc2\xa0Republicans are acknowledging that they\xe2\x80\x99re only doing this because President Obama is a Democrat, and that they would not be doing this if the President of the United States were a Republican. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99re acknowledging that there\xe2\x80\x99s no precedent for them to act this way. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'ll have a debate about the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee. \xc2\xa0We\'ll have a debate about the President fulfilling his constitutional duty. \xc2\xa0But the case against Senate Republicans is closed when it comes to the fact that what Republicans are doing is unprecedented, is motivated entirely by party politics, and is an abdication of their constitutional responsibilities. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, given that sort of unprecedented nature, as you describe it of what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0As Senator Graham described it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Are you all prepared to handle the nominee and the nomination differently than would normally be the case in the sense that normally a nominee doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything until the hearings? \xc2\xa0Are you prepared, whoever the nominee is, for that person to do interviews and be sort of out there defending themselves? \xc2\xa0Are you guys going to talk more about the nominee\xe2\x80\x99s background and have the President talk more about it than you normally would in these situations given the kind of -- the nature of the situation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think at this point it\'s too early to say exactly how this will play out. \xc2\xa0Our expectation is that the President will put forward of unquestioned legal credentials --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When is that going to be?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At a time of the President\xe2\x80\x99s choosing. \xc2\xa0But we\'ll have more on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Before he leaves for Cuba?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not necessarily. \xc2\xa0But the President will put forward somebody who is eminently qualified, as he has the two previous times that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward a nominee to fill a Supreme Court vacancy. \xc2\xa0I\'ve noted on previous occasions that those two nominees earned bipartisan support. \xc2\xa0And the President will certainly put forward somebody this time that deserves bipartisan support.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\'ll have to see if Republicans are going to follow through on their threat to do something that is entirely unprecedented and motivated entirely by party politics, and not even judge this nominee on the merits, but rather judge this person based on the fact that they were nominated by a Democratic President. \xc2\xa0That would be unfortunate. \xc2\xa0It would certainly be inconsistent with the expectations of the American people, and inconsistent with the intentions of the Framers of the Constitution.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'ll have to see -- in terms of our rollout strategy, we\'ll have to see exactly what the response is from the Senate before determining what our path forward is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to clarify, you said that it\'s not necessarily something that would come before the Cuba trip?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not necessarily.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you give any guidance on timing, Josh?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, I can\'t -- other than confirming for you that the President will not make this announcement at the South by Southwest event today. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t looking for confirmation about that. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He has not made his decision? \xc2\xa0So it\'s not -- because you just said just now he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made his decision, so it\'s not that he\xe2\x80\x99s made it and has not yet announced it, but he has not yet decided?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That is correct. \xc2\xa0The process of reviewing information about potential nominees continues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- the weekend while the President is here in Texas?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know if the President will have the opportunity to do much work on it while we are in Texas, but I would anticipate that the President, over the course of this weekend, will spend some time on it -- possibly on the flights, but most likely when the President is home in Washington on Sunday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- the ruse to interview Supreme Court candidates? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I know of. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any candidate or potential nominee like Secretary Lynch that have taken their names out of the running based on the potential political difficulties this may make for them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\'m aware of. \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of any other comments like that in private or in public. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Justin Trudeau yesterday and if the F35 project came up at all, and whether the President pushed him one way or the other on any F35 purchases? \xc2\xa0That\'s going to be kind of a sticking point with Canada.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t actually have a more detailed readout of their discussions from yesterday. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99ll check with my colleagues back in Washington and see if they can give some better guidance about where this particular situation stands.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, the President gave an interview to the Atlantic\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t-- or several interviews to the Atlantic that were published yesterday. \xc2\xa0Britain is concerned about his comments about Prime Minister David Cameron and the status of the special relationship. \xc2\xa0Did the President realize, or is he surprised by the reaction there of his criticism of David Cameron? \xc2\xa0And can you expand on what he meant when he said that the Prime Minister was distracted during the time of the Libya crisis?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think -- let me start by saying that President Obama values deeply the special relationship between the United States and our allies in the UK. \xc2\xa0In particular, President Obama and Prime Minister Cameron have established a particularly effective working relationship that has allowed the United States to work closely with our British allies on a whole range of significant challenges, including our ongoing campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOne of the key asks that we have made of our NATO allies is to demonstrate a clear commitment to investing in defense and national security capabilities up to 2 percent of their GDP. \xc2\xa0And we were quite gratified to see Prime Minister Cameron a couple of years ago make a commitment to ensure that the UK would live up to that 2 percent threshold and to see them follow through on that commitment. \xc2\xa0That will ensure that our British allies have the kinds of resources to make sure that our NATO alliance will remain strong and will retain all of the necessary capabilities to defend our alliance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think that\xe2\x80\x99s just one good example of how Prime Minister Cameron has been a particularly effective interlocutor with President Obama, but more importantly, a partner and ally when it comes to confronting core national security priorities for both our countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has acknowledged on a couple of occasions some of the shortcomings of the situation in Libya. \xc2\xa0What the President has acknowledged as recently as his remarks to the General Assembly at the United Nations last fall that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the kind of follow-through that we would have liked to see after the military intervention there. \xc2\xa0And the President acknowledged in his remarks at the U.N. that the United States bore some responsibility for that as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think more broadly the argument that the President was making in the Atlantic piece is that the United States cannot and should not put ourselves in a situation or in a position to be the world\xe2\x80\x99s policeman. \xc2\xa0We need to count on -- we need to be able to count on our partners and allies around the world to help us confront significant challenges. \xc2\xa0The United States is going to continue to be an indispensable country; when there are big challenges around the world, people look to the United States to step up and address them. \xc2\xa0That has been true for many generations. \xc2\xa0It will be true for generations to come. \xc2\xa0And it certainly has been true while President Obama has been in office, and in fact, based on our effective advocacy of American values and American principles, the United States has actually been more effective in advancing our interests around the globe by enhancing our capacity to confront these challenges.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Iran situation is probably the best example of this. \xc2\xa0When President Obama took office, Iran was on the march to building a nuclear weapon and the international community was fractured in terms of trying to figure out what sort of response we should marshal to prevent that from happening. \xc2\xa0President Obama laid out a clear strategy for engaging the Iranian regime that was subject to intense criticism back here at home, but it was a strategy that was ultimately successful, by rallying the international community to our side, imposing tough sanctions on Iran, bringing them to the negotiating table and negotiating an agreement that, in a verifiable way, prevents them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat approach to problem-solving has bolstered the United States standing in the international community. \xc2\xa0It has confronted one of the, if not the most pressing national security threats to the United States, and has enhanced our ability to work with our allies to achieve it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The question, again, was about British Prime Minister Cameron. \xc2\xa0Did the President mean to be critical of him? \xc2\xa0And what\xe2\x80\x99s his response to the reaction over there to that interview?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I guess to put a more fine point on it, no. \xc2\xa0And if you look at the direct quotes from the President in the story, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include a criticism of Prime Minister Cameron. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What did he mean when he said that Prime Minister Cameron was distracted?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the President was acknowledging that the international community, including the United States, including the United Kingdom, including France and other countries who were involved in the military intervention in Libya, didn\xe2\x80\x99t follow through after that military intervention in Libya in a way that was sufficient to safeguard our interests in that country and to bring about the kind of political transition that reflected the will and ambition of the Libyan people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there would be -- under any circumstances, there would have been significant challenges in succeeding in that effort. \xc2\xa0But it\'s clear that the amount of attention that was devoted to Libya after the military intervention was insufficient. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say all of us were distracted, he said David Cameron was distracted. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess what I\'m pointing out is that in the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech to the U.N. General Assembly last fall he acknowledged that the United States also bore some of that responsibility. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The pressing point seems to be that the international community dropped the ball on Libya somewhat. \xc2\xa0Is it picked up yet? \xc2\xa0I mean, are the Europeans doing what they need to be doing right now to isolate the Islamic State or roll back the Islamic State there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Andrew, you obviously have your own experience covering this issue, and I think even based on your observation in your reporting, we\'ve made a lot of important progress in Libya over the last two or three years. \xc2\xa0The U.N. has led a painstaking diplomatic effort to try to put in place -- or assist the Libyans to put in place a democratic government that is responsive to the Libyan population in a way that can address a lot of the political but also security instability in their country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe United States has had a special envoy to that effort and the United States has made a tangible contribution to try to bring the parties together to accomplish that goal. \xc2\xa0The United States has also devoted some military resources to carrying out strikes against extremists in Libya that could pose a threat to our interests in the region. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'ve made important progress, but there\xe2\x80\x99s more important work that needs to get done in Libya, and we will not be successful in Libya without the continued engagement of our European allies that have a lot of experience in Libya.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s been too much foot-dragging over forming the Libyan government? \xc2\xa0Are you frustrated by the speed of progress? \xc2\xa0Is it time to kind of knock some heads together?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what is clear, we would have liked to have seen this process move more quickly. \xc2\xa0But, look, there are a whole host of very special challenges to Libya. \xc2\xa0After decades of authoritarian rule, trying to put in place and support a successful democratic government is challenging. \xc2\xa0You essentially didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much of a civil society in Libya because it had been decimated by an authoritarian, totalitarian dictator.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo bringing about this kind of political transition was always going to be challenging, was always going to be marked by setbacks, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of important progress, and that is thanks primarily to the good work of diplomats like the Special Representative from the U.N. and other diplomats, including the U.S. Special Envoy, trying to bring the parties together and form a stable government that can try to put to rest some of the political turmoil there, but most importantly, try to bring some control over the security situation in that country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to ask about two different things in the story. The first is President Erdogan. \xc2\xa0President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of him is -- President Obama reportedly believes that he is a failure, authoritarian, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done enough militarily to intervene in their neighbor, Syria. \xc2\xa0Is that an accurate kind of representation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s view and what he conveyed in those interviews?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Let me just say that what our view of Turkey has been is that we did spend some period of time urging the Turks to engage more effectively with our counter-ISIL coalition. And over the last nine months or so, that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done. \xc2\xa0We have seen the Turks give access to the United States and our partners to military facilities inside of Turkey that has made military operations against ISIL in Syria more efficient and more effective. \xc2\xa0We have seen the Turks take specific steps to more effectively seal off their border between Turkey and Syria. \xc2\xa0Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s more work that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see them do, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that they have made important progress in sealing off the border.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTurkey has also borne a significant burden when it comes to Syrian migrants fleeing violence in their country. \xc2\xa0And we have certainly been appreciative of all that the Turks have done to try to meet the needs of those people. \xc2\xa0And the United States has provided the Turks significant financial assistance to do that. \xc2\xa0And we have made the case that Turkey should take these steps because of the obvious national security consequences for Turkey. All this instability along their border is destabilizing and not good for the country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo they had their own interests for intervening, and we made clear that we would stand by our NATO ally as they did it. \xc2\xa0We have done that. \xc2\xa0And that has served the interests of Turkey, it\xe2\x80\x99s served the interests of the United States, and it served the interests of our counter-ISIL coalition quite effectively.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So is it fair to read from your silence that you don\xe2\x80\x99t dispute the notion that President Obama sees President Erdogan as a failed authoritarian?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what is also true is, even though we had been able to effectively cooperate with the Turks when it comes to Syria and a whole host of areas, we also have expressed our concern with some aspects of the political climate inside of Turkey. \xc2\xa0There are some ways in which we feel the Turkey government has not been sufficiently supportive of universal human rights -- the kind of human rights that we obviously deeply value here in the United States and that we advocate for around the world.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet me give you one example. \xc2\xa0Recently, the Turkish government announced essentially the takeover of Zaman newspaper in Turkey. \xc2\xa0This is one of the largest media outlets inside of Turkey and it has essentially been taken over by the government. Here in the United States, we deeply value the freedom of the press -- in fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the main reasons we\xe2\x80\x99re having this conversation right now -- and we are concerned when we see those kinds of values be so obviously trampled upon. \xc2\xa0And we have not hesitated to speak out when we see it, and we have not hesitated to speak out in those instances in Turkey where it\xe2\x80\x99s clear it\xe2\x80\x99s happening.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The other thing that sort of piqued my interest in the story was that Secretary Kerry has reportedly repeatedly advocated sort of a covert airstrike against targets belonging to the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0The President also reportedly has sort of denied those requests. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could rule out the possibility that the U.S. would ever take that type of airstrike against the Assad regime, especially without kind of getting prior congressional authorization, which is something that you guys have emphasized as an important part of your strategy there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me just say that our focus inside of Syria has been focused on degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. \xc2\xa0And there are significant military resources that have been expended in that effort, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0By supporting forces on the ground and carrying out military airstrikes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve retaken about *20 11 percent of the territory in Syria that ISIL previously held -- that\xe2\x80\x99s populated territory. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that by implementing a strategy that the President has laid out of supporting forces on the ground who are fighting for their own country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have been clear and unambiguous about the fact that President Obama does not believe that there is a military solution that can be imposed on Syria. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of problems that are plaguing that country. \xc2\xa0And what is required to address those many problems inside of Syria is a long overdue political transition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the United States, Secretary Kerry, in particular, has led the diplomatic effort to try to bring the world together, the interested parties together to try to bring the parties inside of Syria together to organize the opposition and to organize and facilitate conversations with the regime, and bring about a transition inside of Syria that would allow a government that has the confidence of the Syrian people and reflects the will and ambitions of the Syrian people. \xc2\xa0That is the ultimate solution to the situation in Syria, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what our efforts in Syria have been focused on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So despite all that, you won\xe2\x80\x99t rule out the possibility that the U.S. can take military action against the Assad regime in some capacity?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into any private conversations between Secretary Kerry and President Obama. \xc2\xa0But what\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that Secretary Kerry himself has probably spent more time than anyone else trying to bring along all of the parties to get these political talks on track so that we can address the political turmoil inside of Syria that has contributed to the rise of ISIL and the significant humanitarian disaster inside of Syria that has not just destabilized the region, but has had an even destabilizing impact on Europe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0German intelligence services and U.K. media outlets have apparently got their hands on the names of around 22,000 Islamic State -- or people who are believed to have traveled to Syria and Iraq to fight with the Islamic State. \xc2\xa0Does the U.S. have that intelligence for themselves? \xc2\xa0Is it real? \xc2\xa0Is it actionable? \xc2\xa0Could it be a significant breakthrough in kind of dismantling ISIS?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, Andrew, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a whole lot on this. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously aware of the reports -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten quite a bit of attention. \xc2\xa0And obviously part of our counter-ISIL coalition efforts are devoted to intelligence cooperation and intelligence-sharing, and that includes an effective intelligence relationship with the Germans. That\xe2\x80\x99s enhanced national security in the United States and Germany and has contributed to our campaign against ISIL. \xc2\xa0But beyond that, there\xe2\x80\x99s not much I can say.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, do you guys have any reaction to the Russian that was -- the announcement that the Russian friend of Putin is now\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t-- that died last fall has now been -- it was decided that he was killed? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve read those rather lurid media reports. \xc2\xa0This is a death that is still under investigation by the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., where this death occurred. \xc2\xa0I understand that the FBI is involved as well. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information about this ongoing investigation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are the national security parts of the government monitoring, or whatever, in terms of any diplomatic and/or in a foreign policy implication -- as the investigation goes forward?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specific conversations along those lines. \xc2\xa0But obviously the local law enforcement authorities and the FBI will conduct an appropriate investigation, and if it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for the Department of Justice and the FBI to update relevant national security components of the U.S. government on the pace of that investigation, then they will do that. \xc2\xa0They will do that in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with the investigation. \xc2\xa0But if and when they do, it\xe2\x80\x99s something I probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to discuss publicly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, just a quick question on North Korea. \xc2\xa0The North Korean President has issued another order or edict for more nuclear tests to be carried out, I believe. \xc2\xa0And this comes on the back of a series of announcements about military capabilities and tests and so on. \xc2\xa0Are you seeing this as just business as usual, the usual kind of saber-rattling? \xc2\xa0Or is this something more significant that\xe2\x80\x99s brewing in North Korea?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what is certainly true is that there is a long history of provocative acts and destabilizing actions on the part of the North Korean government. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s particularly true this time of year as the United States is engaged in a series of military exercises with our South Korean allies and with other allies and partners of the United States in the region. \xc2\xa0Those exercises are often an excuse cited by the North Korean government to say and do provocative things. \xc2\xa0But we obviously take the threat from North Korea quite seriously. \xc2\xa0After all, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we conduct these international military exercises, is to ensure that our forces are ready to protect our allies in South Korea and our other allies like Japan, who could also be at risk. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we certainly take this seriously. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to monitor the actions and comments of the North Korean leader and other North Korean government officials. \xc2\xa0But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that we have had some success in mobilizing the international community to impose sanctions against North Korea that go beyond anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve done before. \xc2\xa0That will put additional pressure on the North Korean government. \xc2\xa0It will further isolate the North Korean government, but ultimately, it will be up to the North Korean government to decide if that will prompt them to change their behavior.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would the President be going to Nancy Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s funeral if he were not going to Texas right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a possibility, Darlene. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this -- obviously this visit to Austin has been on the books for a number of weeks now and was certainly on the books long before President Obama -- long before we learned of Mrs. Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s death. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously pleased that Mrs. Obama will be representing the administration at the funeral and offering her condolences not just on behalf of the family but on behalf of the country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMrs. Reagan was a remarkable woman and will have an important place in American history. \xc2\xa0President Obama has had an opportunity to talk about this a couple of times. \xc2\xa0And certainly Mrs. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s attendance at the funeral is consistent with past practice and the way that previous administrations were represented at the funerals of previous First Ladies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has he spoken with any of the Reagan children or sent condolence notes or anything like that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if any specific conversations like that. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll check on it for you. \xc2\xa0But obviously Mrs. Obama will be bringing with her condolences that she\xe2\x80\x99ll share to the Reagan family not just on behalf of the Obama family but on behalf of the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I do the weekly check-in on if you guys have anything to say on the Burr-Feinstein legislation on encryption coming out of the Senate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new -- which is to say we continue to be in touch with Congress, and I continue to be personally skeptical -- more broadly, going beyond just this specific legislation, I continue to be a little skeptical of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s ability to handle such a complicated policy area, given Congress\xe2\x80\x99s recent inability to handle even simple things.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can talk at all -- there have been a couple violent incidents at Trump rallies. \xc2\xa0The two Democratic candidates have issued statements expressing concern. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that the White House wanted to say about this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say in general that there is no excuse or justification for acts of violence against reporters who are covering a political event. \xc2\xa0And the White House, like many other people, including other Republicans, has been concerned by the invective and taunting that\xe2\x80\x99s been directed at journalists covering a political event. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s totally inappropriate. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not consistent with the standards of political discourse that should be observed by anybody who is seeking the highest elected office in the greatest country of the world. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve asked this before, but I guess I just want to take another little shot at it. \xc2\xa0Is some of the tenor of this rhetoric starting to affect the way the U.S. government conducts its business around the world? \xc2\xa0I mean, are you getting questions from foreign leaders about this now that Trump appears to be the frontrunner for the Republican nomination?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the thing that I have learned in this job, and having an opportunity to travel around the world much more than I did prior to working at the White House, I\'m often struck by how people in other countries closely follow and have a pretty sophisticated understanding of American politics. \xc2\xa0Certainly much more than Americans follow the political climate or political campaigns taking place in other countries. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo people around the world are watching. \xc2\xa0And it does -- the tone and tenor of that debate does have an impact on the way that people around the world see the United States. \xc2\xa0It\'s why the stakes of U.S. elections, particularly when they are elections for President, are so high. \xc2\xa0They have lots of consequences for domestic policy in the United States, but they also have consequences for the way the United States is viewed around the world. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMany others have observed that this is one of the reasons that President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s election in 2008 was such a seminal moment in American history. \xc2\xa0It had a profound impact on the way that the United States was viewed around the world. \xc2\xa0And the truth is -- this is why it\'s also important -- the truth is that President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s election informed the world a whole lot about the American people and about the potential that exists here in America. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think in some ways, that\'s a good example and a good reminder of the way that people around the world continue to watch our political debate, and they continue to follow our elections. \xc2\xa0And it\'s why what is said on the campaign trail by leading candidates for President matters. \xc2\xa0It\'s not just idle chatter. \xc2\xa0It has an impact. \xc2\xa0But it\'s also why the decision that the American people will have to make this fall is so significant.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOkay. \xc2\xa0Let me do a quick week ahead. \xc2\xa0It\'s short.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Monday, the President will visit the State Department to deliver remarks at the Chief of Missions Conference. \xc2\xa0This is the Chief of Missions of U.S. diplomatic facilities around the world are coming to Washington for a conference. \xc2\xa0The President will address those diplomats who are doing such important work representing the United States around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will that be in the morning?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I believe it is late morning and early afternoon, actually -- around lunchtime.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAfterwards, the President will deliver brief opening remarks to the performance of musical selections from Hamilton. \xc2\xa0This will be a culmination of a daylong event hosted by the First Lady for students of the Broadway cast of Hamilton. \xc2\xa0I anticipate a lot of jockeying to be in the White House press pool that day.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will hold --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible.) \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\'ll get back to you on the timing. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will hold his annual bilateral meeting with Taoiseach Kenny of Ireland. \xc2\xa0Afterwards, the President and the Vice President will travel to the United States Capitol to the \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of Ireland\xe2\x80\x9d luncheon. \xc2\xa0Later on, the President will deliver remarks at a reception for St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day at the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Wednesday, the President will deliver remarks for Women\xe2\x80\x99s History Month at the White House. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for Thursday and Friday still remains in flux. \xc2\xa0Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ll be spending some time preparing for the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Cuba and Argentina. \xc2\xa0But we\'ll keep you updated on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule to the end of the week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, given that you mentioned the Taoiseach, is the President concerned about the fact that the Irish government still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been organized, and do you expect him to talk with him about it when he\xe2\x80\x99s here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0On previous visits when the President has met with the Taoiseach it has been an opportunity not just to celebrate the close ties between the United States and Ireland but also to discuss some important policy issues. \xc2\xa0And there are certainly some areas where we would like to see the Irish continue to make progress and continue to implement some reforms that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on for a long time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThank you, guys. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:41 P.M.
