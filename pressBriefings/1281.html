EDT</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This week we are approaching the six-month mark since the President signed the health care legislation. \xc2\xa0And when he was talking to Democrats on the Hill about this legislation, he made a point of saying that this is something that you can be proud to campaign on come November. \xc2\xa0And we are not seeing hardly any Democrats that supported health care campaigning on that legislation. \xc2\xa0Why do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s happening, and has the President asked them to do that now that we\xe2\x80\x99re approaching --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, the President is not directing the messaging or ads for individual candidates. \xc2\xa0Obviously they\xe2\x80\x99ll do what they think and what they believe is best in terms of what they want to talk about in their districts. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, as you mentioned, that we\xe2\x80\x99re arriving at a point in which a number of the important consumer protections will kick in for health care, including important protections on preexisting conditions, which represent truly landmark reforms.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave individual messaging decisions to individual candidates. \xc2\xa0But I think, as you see over the next -- the course of the next few days these consumer protections kick in, I think you will -- you will see and notice the type of protections that many Democrat and Republican had long wished for -- that no longer can somebody be discriminated against simply because they\xe2\x80\x99re sick. \xc2\xa0Those represent meaningful, tangible reforms for the people of this country.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But does it send any message about this legislation that these candidates who actually came out and voted for it feel like they can\xe2\x80\x99t campaign for it, that it\xe2\x80\x99s a negative for them to campaign on it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s necessarily the case, and, look, I turn on the TV all the time and see discussions on a large variety of topics that -- in the midst of political campaigns. \xc2\xa0But I think people that supported this and the families that they are working to protect can and should be proud of the accomplishment.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then just to go back to the town hall yesterday, it was one of the first times that at least a lot of us saw supporters of the President ask him very pointed questions and say that they were disappointed in what they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen since he\xe2\x80\x99s taken office. \xc2\xa0Did the President leave that town hall feeling differently about sort of the mood in the country and could you kind of share his reaction --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0He -- look, the President gets letters from people all across the country all the time. \xc2\xa0The President has an opportunity to talk to -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in town hall meetings or as he travels around the country -- to talk to people all the time. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- the notion that somehow anybody is surprised that we\xe2\x80\x99re not where we want to be economically, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine -- we certainly weren\xe2\x80\x99t surprised. \xc2\xa0I mean, I think the notion that people are frustrated at -- again, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, it took us a long time to get here, right? \xc2\xa0For 10 years we watched incomes decline. \xc2\xa0So that frustration built for 10 years.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody believed it was going to turn around in a year or year and a half or in 20 months. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of that anger and frustration out there.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The notion that people that supported us would be immune to that frustration when the President himself is frustrated I don\xe2\x80\x99t think is something that the President believed.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged today but said it was -- stood ready to provide additional assistance to bolster the economic recovery. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that, which seems to suggest a willingness to help -- to keep unemployment from rising?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I am told by my friends at the Treasury not to comment on the actions of the Fed, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see today as a good day to disregard that sage advice.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And this -- China. \xc2\xa0The President said yesterday that China had not done enough to let the value of its currency rise. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting Premier Wen on Thursday, I believe. \xc2\xa0Will he be -- will the President be asking face to face for some kind of flexibility on the rise of the yuan?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Matt, I think as the President said yesterday, this is a topic that comes up in conversations that are had at many different levels within the administration, be it with Treasury officials, White House officials, administration officials writ large. \xc2\xa0As he said, they\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed a willingness to do so, but have not done everything that needs to be done; that we would continue to monitor that and it is obviously an issue of concern and one that was brought up on the recent trip that Dr. Summers and Tom Donilon were on. \xc2\xa0And I anticipate that it will be one of the many issues that will be brought up this week as well.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Now, the Chinese Foreign Minister said today that the U.S. should stop pointing fingers and take care of its own economic problems. \xc2\xa0Any response to that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0John Brennan went to Yemen and, coincidentally or not, Yemen is now in the midst of a new assault. \xc2\xa0Some officials in the government there believe that they might have Awlaki cornered. \xc2\xa0How much was Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s visit tied to this new military offensive, and what did Brennan say -- I know he delivered a letter, but what did he say?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports of the actions in Yemen. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m told they\xe2\x80\x99re not tied to anything that John did or said or his presence there. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on those reports. \xc2\xa0Obviously the government has been involved for quite some time in a struggle against al Qaeda and its extremist allies in the region that have sought to topple the government.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So we -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that John extended the continued message of our support for their efforts to do so.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have they been doing enough against AQAP?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think -- without getting into operational details, I think that we have seen success there. \xc2\xa0Obviously there is a lot of work to be done to keep countries and their governments safe and keep the American people safe, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do just that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on health care, WellPoint, CIGNA, Coventry Run -- CoventryOne, rather -- have all said they\xe2\x80\x99re going to drop children-only health insurance plans because of these new consumer protections that the administration is heralding. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what your response is.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously very unfortunate that insurance companies continue to make decisions on the backs of children and families that need their help.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 First and foremost, the Affordable Care Act provides a host of protections that many of these families could only dream of. \xc2\xa0The child-only policies represent a very, very small part of the individual market. \xc2\xa0Nonetheless, the insurance protection lobby, AHIP, had previously stated their willingness to abide by the law and not make the decision that we see several of these insurers made.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tObviously we\xe2\x80\x99re very disappointed at the decision they\xe2\x80\x99ve made. \xc2\xa0But in the end, the protections that we have are greater than, as I said, most of these families could ever have hoped for in terms of protecting their children from -- or ensuring that their children had access to the type of health care they could only dream of.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did you call them the \xe2\x80\x9cinsurance protection lobby?\xe2\x80\x9d</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what AHIP stands for, but some reason, \xe2\x80\x9cP\xe2\x80\x9d in my mind popped into protection. \xc2\xa0But it seems to fit, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just wondered if this was new, okay.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Collins, Susan Collins, confirmed to our group on the Hill that she has spoken with the Vice President -- he has reached out to her -- and that he understands in some ways her frustrations. \xc2\xa0This is somebody who agrees with the administration in repealing \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d but says that Senator Reid -- because there\xe2\x80\x99s not an opportunity for open debate or for offering amendments, that she cannot go forward and support the legislation. \xc2\xa0Is there a sense of frustration from the administration that you have an ally here who feels that because of the process, she cannot support repealing \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell?\xe2\x80\x9d</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Look, obviously we are -- we\xe2\x80\x99re grateful for her support of repealing \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I obviously did not hear the conversation that the Vice President had. \xc2\xa0My sense is there is a tremendous frustration on the part of many involved that we hear all the time about the procedural hurdles that many Republicans want to throw into this process. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why it took three or four months for us to get a bill as seemingly non-controversial as small business tax cuts through the United States Senate.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 It is obviously our hope that we can get the defense bill done. \xc2\xa0The President, obviously, as you know, supports the repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d and obviously the bill also included the DREAM Act, which is supported by Democrats, Republicans, and many in this administration. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work on all of those fronts.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is Senator Reid being helpful or hurtful in the process?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think Senator Reid has done an incredible job at leading the United States Senate, and is being helpful on making progress on what\xe2\x80\x99s important to families.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there anybody from the administration who\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging him to perhaps change this so that there would be open debate, or --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, let\xe2\x80\x99s understand what Mitch McConnell and others want. \xc2\xa0Open debate is a grab bag of -- a grab bag of ideas that are probably left for a different time. \xc2\xa0Again, this was the notion that somehow we weren\xe2\x80\x99t having open debate on a small business bill, and a very simple and non-controversial bill took three or four months. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have nominees waiting 500, 600 days that passed committee unanimously because of slowdown tactics. \xc2\xa0Again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to try to make all this happen.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on another subject, Twitter had a bug this morning.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I noticed.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, you did. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I still don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened. \xc2\xa0I just emailed the tech guys and said I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what just happened. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it was -- there were a lot of characters and letters that didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to line up into anything.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you pause in actually using Twitter to disseminate information from the White House?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, pretty safe to assume that all those letters and numbers and what have you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that disseminated. \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to make any look like -- look -- I was going to say, look like a scene out of the movie \xe2\x80\x9cWar Games.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what -- no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, you know, from time to time, I have no doubt that there will be those that want to gum up the system and things like that. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to continue to use it. \xc2\xa0I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d done something horrific to my own computer and quickly made sure I didn\xe2\x80\x99t spill anything on my keyboard or -- because at one point on my computer it just had people\xe2\x80\x99s names on Twitter and then all of their --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Personal information.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, no, all of their -- all of their message was blacked out as if the whole thing was redacted. \xc2\xa0I thought that was -- at first I thought that was somebody\xe2\x80\x99s message and I thought, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that means, but that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of funny. \xc2\xa0But then I realized it was happening to half my messages.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that concern you, that there might be some sort of security breach in the messages that you\xe2\x80\x99re disseminating from the White House, that this could be scrambled or misinterpreted or redirected in some way?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, since the words didn\xe2\x80\x99t equal -- since the combination of letters and numbers didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually equal a message, I\xe2\x80\x99m not worried about that code being misinterpreted.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Look, again, if that were the case then none of us would use computers, right? \xc2\xa0We would -- I mean, inherent in -- I think a few weeks ago news organizations were dealing with bugs that slowed down the system. \xc2\xa0I mean, again, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that because you were worried about that, like I said, you would -- we would all be writing on --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Parchment.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, parchment, or we\xe2\x80\x99d be sending letters in the mail as press releases, which we used to do not too long ago. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s the vagaries of doing business.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d is the White House concerned that if they can\xe2\x80\x99t get past this barrier that\xe2\x80\x99s it for the year and next year, of course, who knows?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the case. \xc2\xa0The President obviously continues to urge Congress to act and is working as well with the Pentagon to see this come to fruition. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is the end.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A lot of people do, though. \xc2\xa0They believe that if they can\xe2\x80\x99t get by it now, this is the last chance, a lot of supporters of repeal, and they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s because the White House just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t pushed hard enough, done what they had to do to get this through.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- if you look at today\xe2\x80\x99s vote, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how you could come to that conclusion. \xc2\xa0It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I mean, there -- again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a procedural hurdle that\xe2\x80\x99s been put up by Republicans not to move to the bill.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President spent a fair amount of time talking to wavering Republicans and Democrats?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, as I said -- well, as Suzanne said, I know the Vice President has made some calls and administration officials made calls.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What about the President? \xc2\xa0Has the President talked to Susan Collins, to Olympia Snowe, to --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with that a minute ago and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s true now.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On -- following up on Jake\xe2\x80\x99s questions about insurance companies, more broadly, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just that insurance companies are not getting into the child-only plans, but some of them are hiking premiums. \xc2\xa0There was a report of premiums going down in one case, but there are a lot of cases here where premiums seem to be going up. \xc2\xa0And with the six-month anniversary, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a lot of attention to health care reform. \xc2\xa0Is this bad news for the elections, for Democrats, that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be saddled with premiums going up when the administration said over and over they were going to go down?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, we have -- if you look at -- in the next couple days, the most sweeping set of consumer protections go into law. \xc2\xa0Because of health care reform, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the life of the Medicare trust fund extended beyond -- extended -- the life of the Medicare trust fund extended 10 years, the largest it has been extended in the history of its existence.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So I think there are a number of subtexts within health care reform, which are enormously important for the American people. \xc2\xa0It is going to take some time. \xc2\xa0More protections will come online over the next few months and years as health care reform gets phased in, and we are going to continue and we\xe2\x80\x99ve given states more power to look at what individual insurance companies have -- or decide they want to do, and blame it on something that can\xe2\x80\x99t be blamed for some of the things that they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Look, Chip, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been fighting the insurance companies for a long, long time on doing what\xe2\x80\x99s right for the American people. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to stop trying to do only what\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of their bottom line. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll work to fight that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And finally, was the President hinting yesterday, as some have reported, that his top economic advisors\xe2\x80\x99 jobs are on the line, depending on how things go in the election?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, I think what the President was musing about was, I think, what is -- would not be a surprise that there will be people that have worked enormously hard over the past two years who make decisions to go back to what they were doing before the administration. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- that is not and should not be looked at as what happens or what may or may not happen in the election.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But for the foreseeable future, are Summers\xe2\x80\x99 and Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s jobs safe?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The President is enormously pleased with the efforts of each of them in what has been -- in what have been very trying times. \xc2\xa0Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not for me to comment on or to make decisions for individuals that decide, again, that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to go back to doing what they were doing before.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 As you well know, because quite frankly all of you are covering on a daily basis, the last two years have been at a remarkable pace, far more hectic than a campaign in which I think many of us thought, boy, is it going to get -- could it get any crazier than this? \xc2\xa0And many days around here, the answer is absolutely.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Mike.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, the President clearly makes an effort to get out to talk to average Americans. \xc2\xa0You mentioned he reads the letters. \xc2\xa0But still, having some people who\xe2\x80\x99d identified themselves as supporters yesterday ask if the American Dream is dead for them, and express that they are exhausted defending him -- no shock there by the President?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Again, the notion that 53 -- I think we had 53 percent of the vote. \xc2\xa0If you\xe2\x80\x99re telling me that up until some time yesterday that I think 53 percent of the American people were immune to the frustrations of the economy, no. \xc2\xa0I would have to be living -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be living in a bubble. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d be living in a bunker. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s just -- the notion of that, I think, is crazy.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Again, let\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think sometimes we sort of fast-forward through what the President says in some of these things. \xc2\xa0As he said in Cleveland and as he restated yesterday, over the past 10 years, we have seen in a period of economic -- overall economic expansion, the slowest job wage growth of any decade since the Second World War, okay? \xc2\xa0So regardless of anything else, people have watched their incomes, the opportunities for their children, all that stuff, slowly erode. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. \xc2\xa0If you weren\xe2\x80\x99t frustrated, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be paying attention.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Of course people are -- all on top of that, their houses are worth less, 8 million people lost their jobs. \xc2\xa0That is the reality of what this administration has had to confront. \xc2\xa0And the notion that people are frustrated does not surprise the President.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, has expressed some criticism of the stimulus, saying it is not wrong to criticize parts of that stimulus as disproportionately saving jobs in the public sector and not stimulating private sector economic growth. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not something he says he is proud to say or wants to say, but it is true. \xc2\xa0Reaction from the White House?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the California statistics in front of me. \xc2\xa0But let\xe2\x80\x99s take wind energy as one. \xc2\xa0California leads the nation in wind energy projects probably on a factor of four than the next highest state. \xc2\xa0If you asked anybody in the wind energy business what was likely to happen to projects that depended on public financing -- or I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, on private financing during the worst economy in a lifetime, the wind energy in and of itself will tell you that you were likely to see a huge shrinking of wind energy projects and maybe the death of an entire industry, given the credit demand problems that we faced coming into office.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 On just clean energy jobs alone, of which California is a huge beneficiary, private sector jobs -- tax credit for wind energy, tax credit for manufacturing and things like that -- I think we have seen a huge change in the fortunes of that industry. \xc2\xa0And, again, most of that, if not all of that, is in the private sector.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I think -- have we taken steps to ensure that kids that go to school in San Francisco don\xe2\x80\x99t lose their teacher because of the budgetary problems that the state of California faces? \xc2\xa0You bet. \xc2\xa0Have we made sure that if somebody needs a police officer or a firefighter in San Francisco and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fall prey to the budgetary situation in the city or in the state? \xc2\xa0You bet.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And I think that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where the mayor is on that. \xc2\xa0I know the American people think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This is arguably the mayor of the bluest of blue cities. \xc2\xa0Do you consider that disloyal to rip the stimulus?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if -- the first I heard about it was when you told me. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t take it that personally.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You guys pushed back the other day on a story that suggested the Democrats were considering a national ad campaign portraying Republicans as all but taken over by the Tea Party. \xc2\xa0You said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true. \xc2\xa0And I guess my question is, if Republicans are nationalizing this election and is making it a referendum on the President, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you guys consider a national campaign in response along those lines?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, we pushed back on a story that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true because, having been on some of these emails, everyone wondered what meeting they missed where somebody wrote a story saying we were about to do a big national ad campaign when none of the people that would be involved in even thinking about that could remember that meeting.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So your pushback was just about it not being true? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not that you\xe2\x80\x99re closed to that notion?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, no, I mean, again, what was untrue was the fact that the story was predicated on a national ad campaign that was neither being -- that neither existed nor was being contemplated.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Look, I talked about some of the choices that as a result of candidates winning in certain states narrowed the electoral map for Republicans because of some of the candidates they\xe2\x80\x99d nominated particularly in the Tea Party, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that. \xc2\xa0But we have -- nobody was making moves to and nobody had contemplated said national ad campaign.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess the question is, whatever it is, six weeks until the election, is the President planning to retool his message or change it? \xc2\xa0Or is it essentially, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, car in a ditch, just louder and more often?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the -- I think what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the Republicans roll out on Thursday will help the President\xe2\x80\x99s message of wanting to go back to the ideas of 2008. \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear from them on Thursday. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President will continue to talk about that message.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If that message has not been compelling to date to voters, I mean, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that suggest a retool?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0How so?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, just that in many, many races, Democrats are running behind.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s six weeks and a lifetime to go on politics. \xc2\xa0So, I mean, again, your own poll showed that the second most potent argument against a Republican in Congress would be going back to the policies of the previous administration.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s policies weren\xe2\x80\x99t much better, right?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0I think the hope is that the House will vote on that in the next couple of days, and our hope would be to sign that quickly sometime maybe early next week, again, depending on when the House passes the bill and sends it down here.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you tell us what\xe2\x80\x99s really going on on the North Lawn? \xc2\xa0I mean, it looks like -- it looks like they\xe2\x80\x99re building something more than just pipes and cables. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Or they\xe2\x80\x99re moving the Washington Monument. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s the only two conceivable -- putting in the foundation to move the Washington Monument right out there, only two conceivable things.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You know, conspiracy theorists are going to say you didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer the question.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, look, I think as I said before, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work. \xc2\xa0I think you have in the defense bill obviously very important funding for the priorities of our Pentagon and our troops; the President also supporting repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d and the DREAM Act that are priorities of his. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re disappointed at not being able to proceed to the legislation, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep trying.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, not a single GOP senator agreed to open debate on the bill. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that? \xc2\xa0I mean, was there a lot of outreach?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Been there, done that. \xc2\xa0Again, 60 is the new 50, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean age. \xc2\xa0To do anything in this town now, you have to get 60 votes. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not the way -- many of the people I think that work in the Senate, including senators, thought this was the way it ought to work.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And is the First Lady hitting the campaign trail because the White House is concerned about getting women to the polls this November?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I will say this. \xc2\xa0North Korea -- it is within the power of the North Koreans to come back to the table and fulfill the obligations that they agreed to in giving up their nuclear program and in ensuring a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. \xc2\xa0So it is well within their own power to make significant progress on that issue. \xc2\xa0And I think that would be a tremendous benefit to the people of North Korea, who bear -- who often bear the consequences of a dictatorship that is not living up to its own responsibilities and obligations.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would that be a positive step, though, if Kim Jong-il --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think there are a whole host of things that they can do. \xc2\xa0The easiest thing to do would simply -- would be to simply live up to the obligations that they agreed to, understanding that not living up to those obligations have seen a tightening of sanctions by the international community in a way that should demonstrate to the North Koreans the international seriousness with which countries all over the world view this issue.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you talk about reports that Israel is suggesting an agreement on a settlement freeze in exchange for the release of somebody who pleaded guilty to spying for Israel?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on that.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And with the number of times that this White House has talked about making a strong pivot to jobs and the economy, is there any concern about pivoting away from jobs and the economy for the next three days in New York?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, because, again, the President -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve done this a hundred times, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it 101st -- the President has been focused on the economy and is focused on the economy, and works on nothing more than he does on the economy each and every day. \xc2\xa0At the same time, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think people expect that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to take the opportunity to improve our relationships around the world and in discussing, quite frankly, with a whole host of nations over the next couple days how to improve our economy, for instance, by increasing our exports, which I know is a big topic with a number of the countries with which we\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing bilateral meetings over the next -- and multilateral meetings over the next few days.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So I think it will, again, present an opportunity for the President to talk about a whole host of things that we can and should do, because if you think about it -- going back to the very first G20 meeting that we had, the President talked about the fact that the American consumer could no longer drive, in and of him and herself, global demand; that there had to -- that we as a country had to export more, that through those exports we would create jobs. \xc2\xa0The President laid out ambitious goals to do that. \xc2\xa0And that will be a healthy part of the discussions that the President has over the next few days.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Scott.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Six months ago, right after the health care bill was signed, President Obama went out and made a number of stops around the country showcasing the bill, what\xe2\x80\x99s in it, how it\xe2\x80\x99s going to benefit people, made a real push. \xc2\xa0Why, in your view, is it less popular today than it was then? \xc2\xa0What has happened in the public mind?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Scott, I have not seen all the polling that you may have. \xc2\xa0Again, I think that -- I think a number of -- if you look at opinion polls, again, I think you overlay it largely with the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with 8 million jobs that have been lost and 9.6 percent unemployment. \xc2\xa0That affects a lot of what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing and a lot of what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, regardless of what the issue is.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the President, will he continue to make the point throughout the campaign season that the health care reform bill is essential to economic progress in this country?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I mean, look, the President did that yesterday at the town hall meeting. \xc2\xa0And I think if you look at and listen to -- if you listen to or go back and listen to what businesses said for a long time, they were getting crushed with health care costs. \xc2\xa0Small businesses that wanted to offer insurance to their employees couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0Now they get a tax cut for doing that. \xc2\xa0Businesses get help; families get help; consumers get the protections that they need to ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re not a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s visit away from going bankrupt. \xc2\xa0And all of those are important for the American people.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Sheryl.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, you talked earlier about people feeling frustrated about the economy and that the President understands that people are frustrated. \xc2\xa0Does he think that people are simply frustrated at the state of the economy, or does he think that they are frustrated with him personally and his handling of it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say first and foremost, Sheryl, again this is -- I have long said that there is a frustration in where we are economically that has existed for many years. \xc2\xa0As I said earlier, we watched wages and standards of living decrease as jobs got shipped overseas, as a whole host of things happened.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that people are frustrated that the pace of our economic recovery has not been faster under the President\xe2\x80\x99s watch. \xc2\xa0But what is undeniable and that you heard the President reiterate yesterday is if you look at where we were and look at how far we\xe2\x80\x99ve come, we\xe2\x80\x99ve not come as far as the President would like -- not by a long shot -- but we\xe2\x80\x99re adding jobs, eight months of private sector hiring, economic -- positive economic growth -- again, all of which is going to take -- this is going to take an enormous amount of time. \xc2\xa0No one in this administration ever said that this was going to be easy or that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take some time.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking, though, is how much does he perceive reactions like we saw yesterday as upset directed at him, directly at him, and not at just the general state of affairs in the country?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the notion -- my guess is that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to divorce, because, look, he understands he\xe2\x80\x99s the President of the United States. \xc2\xa0But, again, you have -- look, at no point during the discussions of doing the Recovery Act did we ever say that the hole that 8 million jobs and several trillion dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of output that disappeared was one piece of legislation going to fix. \xc2\xa0It helped in a big way ensure that losing 750,000 jobs a month wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what happened every month.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And, look, if you look at the job loss over the course of the administration, again, you see us moving in the right direction. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s just going to take some time. \xc2\xa0And I know the President always believed that, and everybody gets that that time may not correlate with a political calendar but there\xe2\x80\x99s not much we can do about that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Ann.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Following on that, this morning former President Clinton said in an interview, kind of appealed to voters, said, well, give Democrats two more years and then if you\xe2\x80\x99re not happy, things aren\xe2\x80\x99t better, you can vote against all of them including President Obama, who will be on the ballot by then. \xc2\xa0Is that --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Interesting deal to cut. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Look, I guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to dispense with all the joy of the 2010 election and fast-forward all the way to 2012 just quite yet. \xc2\xa0But, again, I have no doubt that ultimately in four years that is how this administration will be judged. \xc2\xa0But I also think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- I think this election and I think 2011 and 2012 are also going to be judged on the ideas that both parties put forward.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 But I think I heard the former President say that the American people are frustrated and they should be. \xc2\xa0This President is frustrated. \xc2\xa0The former President is frustrated. \xc2\xa0And that is all certainly understandable.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But those questioners yesterday were frustrated and weren\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied with his answers yesterday, and said so in interviews afterward.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0They also said they strongly supported the President. \xc2\xa0No, actually, I think -- again, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t read all the interviews maybe that you did, but I saw one of them interviewed this morning who said they still were a strong supporter of the President. \xc2\xa0The first woman that asked a question said she was still a supporter of the President.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 But, look, again, the notion of frustration being immune to people that supported the President -- nobody ever thought that was the case. \xc2\xa0I mean, again, understand that what people have gone through -- again, not just since January 20th or even September 15th of 2008, but for years. \xc2\xa0This was a frustration that built for years and years and years. \xc2\xa0Economic expansion that didn\xe2\x80\x99t lead to job -- much job growth and led to income decline. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve virtually never had that before.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If the job creation and growth problems continue to be as persistent, is there any way that President Obama might look at an economy that still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t moved far enough and decide not to run for reelection?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, Ann, I think the President, if he were here, would tell you that he spends next to no time thinking about his reelection in 2012 and spends his time with his team here working on how to strengthen our economic recovery, how to continue to add jobs for a 9th, a 10th, 11th and 12 months in a row; how to make sure that our growth is positive; and how to keep our country safe. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on -- not running for reelection in several years.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Christi.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, two quick things. \xc2\xa0Do you know what the First Lady is going to be speaking about to the Clinton Global Initiative?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I do. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I can say it out loud, so I will have to check with the East Wing.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why is she delivering the message there? \xc2\xa0The President is introducing her, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The President is introducing her and then I think the President, if my scheduling memory is correct -- she speaks; former President Clinton is there; current President Obama is meeting with -- has a Japanese bilat at that time.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo -- but, look, she was invited to be the keynote. \xc2\xa0I think that what she will talk about is something that follows on issues that she\xe2\x80\x99s worked on and is something that is a priority of this administration and of hers personally.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I also ask you, the other day we heard that neither Abbas nor Netanyahu would be meeting with the President. \xc2\xa0I think Netanyahu is not even coming.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Netanyahu is attending. \xc2\xa0I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a decent number of people who are.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there an effort afoot by the White House to get both of them there or to -- for at least --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I think that we feel like the track that is ongoing, the direct talks, the commitment to do so every two weeks that Secretary of State Clinton and former Senator Mitchell are shepherding through is making real progress. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any big push to make sure that we have another one of those meetings in New York, as long as I think, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re on the road to making progress on the direct talk track as we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing right now.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the message he\xe2\x80\x99s taking to the U.N. later this week, and what does he hope to accomplish in the Sudan meeting?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, let me -- I know there was a background call on this yesterday. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to some of that. \xc2\xa0And I have not seen the final remarks yet in terms of the larger message. \xc2\xa0Obviously, if you look at the meetings -- again, bilats with China, bilats with Japan, the ASEAN meeting, the Sudan meeting are all somewhat unique but have overlapping concerns particularly on the global economy; will deal with the issues of North Korea and Iran. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that Middle East peace is something that, though a direct meeting is not on the schedule, will be the topic of quite a bit of conversation there.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, two questions on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0First of all, we know that she\xe2\x80\x99s been pushing out and extending her hand in conversation to senators, but has Lady Gaga reached out to this White House on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d? \xc2\xa0She\xe2\x80\x99s a part of this now.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I do not -- she has not called me. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that. \xc2\xa0I have not heard -- in all seriousness, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not heard of -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve not heard that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you name one song that she\xe2\x80\x99s written?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, but I not dare going to do it on camera. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Anyway, but on a serious note, on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d on the contradiction of civil rights issues and then the Department of Defense being one of the first organizations to integrate in this country, could you talk to me about what some perceive as a contradiction when it comes to this?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Flesh that out for me a little bit.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Flesh it out? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a civil rights issue. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re being denied the repeal. \xc2\xa0And then this --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Oh, sure, okay. \xc2\xa0Look, April, this has been an issue that the President has believed was wrong and believed needed to be changed as a candidate in 2003 in a primary in Illinois, in a general election in 2004, as a U.S. senator, and as a candidate for President. \xc2\xa0This is -- I think the President believes, as former chairs of the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe, that this is a policy that simply does not make sense on a whole host of levels.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd the House has passed a change in that policy. \xc2\xa0We are working with the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of Defense on implementing -- on steps to implement a change, and we believe that a change is coming.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So going back -- okay, going back to my original question, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a change is coming. \xc2\xa0But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it still, as some perceive, a contradiction because, again, the Department of Defense was one of the first organizations to integrate -- understanding that they needed all -- and now we have this fight about repealing or not repealing?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Right, well, look, without getting it -- without really speaking much to the historical context, which I see where you\xe2\x80\x99re going, the President believes this is a fundamentally unfair policy; has spoken out even when people, not just in the past couple years but over the course of his public career, even when this was not a -- the most popular thing to say or do. \xc2\xa0But the President believes the policy is unfair and should and will be changed.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSteve.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, on the economy, you said earlier this is going to take an \xe2\x80\x9cenormous\xe2\x80\x9d amount of time. \xc2\xa0How long?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take several years from -- I think getting through a recession as deep as the one that we were faced with, the sheer amount of job loss, the shock to the system -- shock to our financial system, the change in our housing market. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with, in many ways, if you look at what happened and what cascaded downward all at a certain period of time, you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with sort of the perfect storm.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAs I said, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got folks who\xe2\x80\x99s lost -- they and their friends have lost their jobs; their housing values had decreased; for a long time the credit market was completely frozen. \xc2\xa0There are a whole host of things -- it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just one thing that needed to be fixed in order to get the economy moving again. \xc2\xa0And it took a long time from -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the exact figures in front of me -- but if you think about -- I think the job loss, monthly job loss probably started in December of 2007, and it was probably sometime the middle of 2009 or -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, probably toward the end of 2009 where you saw a month in which we added, on the plus side, new jobs.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good two-year period of -- followed -- or having been followed by a whole host of previous bad months before the recession officially began in December of 2007. \xc2\xa0I just think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a long time to get out of the hole that we found ourselves in.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 There weren\xe2\x80\x99t any quick fixes. \xc2\xa0There aren\xe2\x80\x99t any silver bullets. \xc2\xa0If there were, we would have done so.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I think that speaks to the frustration of what people are feeling. \xc2\xa0If you could hit a button or flip a switch or make something happen overnight, you certainly would do that. \xc2\xa0The problems that we face were long term, they were systemic, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to take some time.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, could I follow up on that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Sure.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The CBO has -- just on that same note, the CBO has projected that unemployment will remain above 8 percent until at least 2012. \xc2\xa0Does the administration have any kind of projections as to when it might go below 8 percent?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if in the mid-session -- I assume in the mid-session review there are some of those figures. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have those in front of me. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, given the frustration that was expressed with the President yesterday, is there anything that the President himself thinks that he may have done wrong on the economy, anything that he would want to take back in his handling of it at this point?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I have not asked that question, Keith, of him directly. \xc2\xa0I know that the President, again, feels the frustration. \xc2\xa0I think we were probably on a different trajectory sometime in the spring and then things impacted our own recovery from Europe. \xc2\xa0But I think we have made a series of decisions -- and the President has made a series of decisions -- that while not altogether politically popular were ones that had to be made when they were made.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, we used to ask Bush this question a lot. \xc2\xa0I mean, so no mistakes, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel that he\xe2\x80\x99s made any mistakes so far in his handling of the economy?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, no, look, again, Keith, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t put this question to him directly. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he might say to that question. \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d just say this. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think he understands that this was going to take some time. \xc2\xa0There weren\xe2\x80\x99t the illusion that somehow, again, this was all going to be better in a very short period of time.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Sam.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s already been calls for Congress to reconsider \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d during the lame-duck period after the elections. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy about legislative activity in that timeframe? \xc2\xa0And I have a follow-up question after that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Yes, Sam, there has not been a lot of discussion around here that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a part of on what happens sort of post-election in Congress. \xc2\xa0Obviously there may well be a whole host of issues including \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d that remain undecided.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Our focus right now is trying to get the business of the people done as Congress remains in session. \xc2\xa0I can try to get a better answer on the lame duck.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0And then the follow-up question is, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a couple progressive sources email me right now wondering why you\xe2\x80\x99re not hammering Republicans harder from the lectern. \xc2\xa0They note that not only did DADT not get overturned but military funding was delayed today. \xc2\xa0And people I think -- Secretary Gates has said that the DREAM Act is essential not only to immigration but to help the U.S. forces readiness. \xc2\xa0Do you think that Congress ended up hurting military readiness today?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Sam, I\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat what I said earlier. \xc2\xa0I think that what we saw -- the delay is frustrating because the bill contained important funding for the Pentagon and for our troops; it contained important priorities of this President and this administration in the DREAM Act and in repealing \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And once again, you have the new normal of needing to have 60 people agree to move forward on simply providing the Pentagon with the funding that it needs for its troops, and I think that is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a sad, sad day where that\xe2\x80\x99s the bar that everything has to go through in order to make progress.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 David.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Two quick ones. \xc2\xa0The Afghanistan report?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0The Afghanistan report, I think Mike Hammer tried to get in touch with you, and I think the Kerry office said that they had not delayed that on any wish of ours. \xc2\xa0But I would point you over to Senator Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s office to get the exact --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Second question, then. \xc2\xa0Do you think that Lady Gaga actually did more to help pass this bill this week than the White House?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS: \xc2\xa0No, because we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be doing this if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the President, David.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Robert, two questions.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS: \xc2\xa0Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s your answer. \xc2\xa0No, David, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be doing -- we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be taking on these issues if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the President. \xc2\xa0This was -- this is an issue that passed the House because of the President and this administration\xe2\x80\x99s work and the work of many members in Congress. \xc2\xa0But understand, David, as I just said, it takes 60 votes just to get on a bill. \xc2\xa0Just to consider a piece of legislation that funds the Pentagon takes 60 votes. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s something that is remarkable in our process, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to this situation where simply funding the Pentagon takes the consent of three-fifths of those that are elected. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not healthy for the way our government works and it sets an awful precedent for getting things done in the future.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0END \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 3:43 P.M.
