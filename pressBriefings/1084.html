EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming to the White House for your daily briefing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements at the top, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Julie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The new budget projections that just came out predict 9 percent unemployment next year when the President is facing reelection, 1.7 percent growth for this year.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that the jobs initiatives the President is going to announce next week will change those projections for the positive?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned yesterday, I think as I mentioned earlier this week, the President will come forward with specific proposals that by any objective measure would add to growth and job creation in the short term.\xc2\xa0 And that will be part of a broad package that reflects his commitment to grow the economy now and to build a foundation for economic growth for the future to ensure that we win the future.\xc2\xa0 So the answer to that is yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if Congress were to pass the package that the President is going to announce, unemployment would be under 9 percent?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think based on -- when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about economic predictions, yes, economic analysts, economists, will be able to look at this series of proposals and say that based on history, based on what we know, based on their collected expertise, that it would add to economic growth and it would cause an increase in job creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the flap yesterday over the date and timing of this speech, is there anything --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What flap?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a bit of a flap.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that the White House would have done differently, in retrospect, in terms of consulting with the Hill or announcing the joint session?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our focus from the beginning was to have the President have the opportunity to speak to the American people and to Congress, in front of Congress, at the soonest possible date upon Congress\xe2\x80\x99s return from its long recess.\xc2\xa0 Wednesday seemed to be the best option.\xc2\xa0 When that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t available -- or when that seemed to be a problem, Thursday was fine with us.\xc2\xa0 And we are just looking forward to -- the President is looking forward to the opportunity to talk about what the American people really care about:\xc2\xa0 the economy and the need to create more jobs.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you would have gone through that process the same way?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All we care about here is that we address the issues that are most important.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly not interested in sort of inside-the-beltway political gamesmanship.\xc2\xa0 What we are interested in is coming up with proposals that make sense, that can grow the economy, can create jobs, that by historical standards would have broad bipartisan support, and that if Congress comes back from their districts -- members of Congress come back from their districts and their states with the same sense of urgency that the President has, and having heard from their constituents the same things that the President heard when he went on his bus tour through the upper Midwest, everyone will come back with the same amount of urgency and focus to get this done -- because what the President will propose can get done, should get done and will benefit the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on one other topic -- the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit to block the AT&amp;T/T-Mobile merger, should that be viewed as the administration taking a more aggressive approach on antitrust?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is a law enforcement action that you should address -- about which you should address your questions to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s based on a law that is designed to foster competition and protect American consumers.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I refer you to the Department of Justice.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Democrats are unifying around the advice that the President needs to go bold in his speech.\xc2\xa0 Is that the way you would characterize the proposals that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to roll out?\xc2\xa0 And are there certain high expectations that one creates when you do a joint session of Congress speech?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to you and others to characterize the speech in the terms that you just described.\xc2\xa0 What will be the case, and the reason why the President wants to speak before Congress, is because this is an important moment in our economy and it is an important moment for the American people who are demanding that Washington put an end to the gridlock and bickering that has paralyzed the process here and take action to help the economy, to create jobs -- to help them. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they want.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t want -- they\xe2\x80\x99re not out there scoring political points.\xc2\xa0 They want -- the vast majority of Americans, whether they voted Democratic or Republican, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re registered with a party or not, they want Washington to work for them.\xc2\xa0 They want them to take sensible actions to work for them -- to create jobs, to grow the economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what this speech will be about.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the concrete proposals the President puts forward will be about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Economists, when you talk to them and ask them what would constitute \xe2\x80\x9cbold,\xe2\x80\x9d throw out figures like $400 billion in fiscal stimulus.\xc2\xa0 Is he looking at anything on that scale?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to give specifics about how many jobs he thinks this package might create when he unveils it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will not preview the speech any more than I really have, except to say that it will focus on the need to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 It will be a collection of proposals that, again, should have bipartisan support, have had a similar -- at similar times have had bipartisan support, that will be, by any objective standard, pro-growth, pro-job creation, and that can be acted on right away if members of Congress come back from their recess ready to do things to help the American people.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about bipartisan ideas that should have bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any indication that some of these ideas will get bipartisan support, like are people in the White House consulting with people on the Hill about some of these specific proposals and have gotten some indication that they would be accepted?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In previous days, when you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been here, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked that question in a variety of ways.\xc2\xa0 The President has consulted widely, as he had throughout his presidency, very interested in ideas that folks might have outside of his administration, in Congress, outside of Washington -- consults frequently with businessmen, with CEOs, with workers.\xc2\xa0 And he has done that in this process.\xc2\xa0 But beyond -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to detail conversations he\xe2\x80\x99s had or lay out which policy proposals may or may not have support from this segment or that segment of Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more question.\xc2\xa0 How has the President reacted to the whole debate yesterday over -- the issues over the scheduling of the speech?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I spent a great deal of time with him this morning and it never came up.\xc2\xa0 Honestly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not asking the right questions.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Jay, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know you guys love this stuff.\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s catnip.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re really not focused on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a basic question here.\xc2\xa0 If you can\xe2\x80\x99t even get the Congress to agree on a date for a speech without a political sideshow, how can we expect -- how can the American people expect that you can do something much more difficult, come up with a jobs plan, deal with the deficit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because the sideshows don\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xc2\xa0 The economy matters.\xc2\xa0 The American people matter.\xc2\xa0 Jobs matter.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why -- you know, if Thursday is the day, Thursday is the day.\xc2\xa0 We want to give this speech.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to talk to the American people.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to call on Congress to act.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what does it say about your ability to get anything out of this Congress?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you can\xe2\x80\x99t work on a scheduling date for a speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 John, it\xe2\x80\x99s irrelevant and it\xe2\x80\x99s -- this is small stuff.\xc2\xa0 The issue is whether it\xe2\x80\x99s -- we were -- Wednesday was the soonest possible day upon their return from their recess.\xc2\xa0 Thursday is fine with us.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to give the speech Thursday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So on the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The issue about -- look, going back to what I said before, the cooperation, it\xe2\x80\x99s about -- do the members of Congress return next week to Washington, having heard from their constituents that they\xe2\x80\x99re fed up, right?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re tired -- you and I have been in Washington long enough and covered this stuff long enough that the cycles of gridlock, cycles of partisanship -- not new, right?\xc2\xa0 And people get frustrated with it because they think Washington is incompetent or broken.\xc2\xa0 What they saw this summer is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not incompetence, it\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous.\xc2\xa0 The incompetence, the gridlock, actually threatened and harmed the American economy, harmed the American people.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just not acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what I think and what we hope will happen upon Congress\xe2\x80\x99s return is that they will have heard from their constituents that enough is enough and that it is time to actually do things that are productive, do things that are helpful to the economy, rather than retreat to your corner and hope that you win the partisan political battle for an ideological band within your own political party.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just not going to cut it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the American -- so the President believes -- again, because he will put forward proposals that we believe should have bipartisan support, that faced with that imperative -- because everyone here is working for the American people, and the members of Congress, like the President, were elected by the American people -- will do the right thing and actually focus on the issues that matter, which -- the economy and jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the only indications are bad, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you had this kerfuffle over the speech, the super committee has had -- the only thing -- they haven\xe2\x80\x99t even had a meeting of the full committee but the two sides have been off to their own corners, Democrats meeting with Democrats, Republicans meeting with Republicans.\xc2\xa0 This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be an auspicious start.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re too focused on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening within the narrow confines of not just this town but the handful of blocks between here and Congress.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, members of Congress have to answer to their constituents.\xc2\xa0 The President answers to every American citizen.\xc2\xa0 They have heard -- they will have heard the imperative from the American people to put an end to the nonsense and get to work.\xc2\xa0 And I think there is an opportunity here for the American people to drive this process, to have their demands heard, to -- we\xe2\x80\x99re faced with a challenging situation.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the recovery is moving too slowly, that we need to do something to boost growth, to boost job creation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a number one priority, and any data you can come across that the American people have, number one priority of Democrats, independents and Republicans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that information, we should act.\xc2\xa0 And the President is hopeful that Congress will want to join him in doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Norah.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you blame partisanship, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t this -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t the real culprit here an inability to just communicate on the most simple terms?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We communicate all the time with Congress.\xc2\xa0 We obviously spent a lot of time this year communicating with Congress.\xc2\xa0 And this President has since he took office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The problem -- the problem -- I mean, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need a civics lesson from me but I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you one anyway.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, but I think the problem is -- and I think everyone in here is aware of this -- is that the partisanship that -- and the apparent polarization that is sometimes observed here and felt here, is actually not very reflective of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening out in the country, that the country is pretty unified when it comes to their priorities, when it comes to their belief that compromise is necessary, when it comes to their acceptance that the far ends of either spectrum don\xe2\x80\x99t have the answers necessarily.\xc2\xa0 So if you look back over our history, we\xe2\x80\x99re closer together in many ways than we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been, and we ought to take advantage of that instead of fabricate false divides that prevent us from getting things done. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, would you concede -- I mean, compromise requires effective communication between the two parties.\xc2\xa0 And my understanding of what happened yesterday was that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Chief of Staff first reached out to the Speaker at about 10:30 in the morning and delivered a message that the President wanted to speak to a joint session of Congress, but there was no give-and-take that is part of the regular give-and-take that goes on between a White House and the Congress about delivering a joint session of Congress.\xc2\xa0 You cited from the podium congressional scheduling yesterday as one of the concerns and yet it appears that there was no one who checked with Congress about what\xe2\x80\x99s the -- whether they could get everybody back in time to hear from the President, so you conceded on that point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the focus on the details of this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What has happened with the communication between the President and his staff and the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s staff?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have fine communication.\xc2\xa0 And I think the focus on this is really yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s story; it is not what people care about.\xc2\xa0 We were interested in speaking Wednesday because Congress was returning, both houses, first day after Labor Day -- Wednesday -- after a long recess, that was the first day they were back.\xc2\xa0 There were no initial objections to that.\xc2\xa0 When problems were expressed, we said -- we talked about it and we said, fine, Thursday will work for us fine.\xc2\xa0 Because the -- it\xe2\x80\x99s just not very relevant.\xc2\xa0 What matters is moving as quickly as possible to raise and then address the issues the American people care about -- the economy, jobs, the need to build a foundation that includes getting our fiscal house in order while we invest in key areas like innovation and education and infrastructure, building the capacity to compete in the 21st century against a world that\xe2\x80\x99s growing more competitive.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what people care about.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t care about what happened at 11 o\xe2\x80\x99clock versus what happened at 4 o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xc2\xa0 They care about what are we doing to make the economy grow, to help the private sector hire, and make sure that their kids are getting educated.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s failure to work this out behind the scenes, before there was this very public kerfuffle or spat, and given what happened during the debt ceiling, where there were people who are elected members who hung up on one another and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t return phone calls, what can you say today that would give confidence to the American people that Republicans and the President can actually work together to solve whatever hard problems facing this country, based on that track record?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will go back to what I said to John and I think to Julie and others, that we believe that members of Congress -- House and Senate -- will have heard from their constituents what the President heard in Minnesota -- in small towns in Minnesota, in Iowa, in Illinois, what he heard the previous week in Michigan, which is that the American people -- Democrat, Republican, independent -- are tired of the bickering and they want reasonable compromise solutions to the problems that face the country.\xc2\xa0 They want the government to do things that help the economy grow, that help private sector hire, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t expect and they get frustrated by politicians who don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think everyone will have gotten an earful from the very people who sent them to Washington about what their priorities are, and I think that, because everyone here works for the American people, that that will have a salutary effect on their behavior -- we hope.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, following on that, you\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely right.\xc2\xa0 Obviously everyone knows sideshows matter less than helping people who are unemployed -- obviously.\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be acknowledging that there\xe2\x80\x99s a process in Washington that has to be dealt with to help those people who are unemployed.\xc2\xa0 And I think what John and Norah are suggesting is if the President is having this much trouble with the date -- you have James Carville saying on ABC today, \xe2\x80\x9cThe last thing the White House needed was to appear to cave in to the Speaker, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So if there\xe2\x80\x99s a perception even among Democrats that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough clout with the Hill to figure out what day it is, how is he going to pass a plan to help the American people?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look -- Ed, you guys, I honestly think that your obsession with this is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not an obsession.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- is not -- what the American people expect the President to do, what the American people expect their senators and congressmen and women to do, is listen to them and take action.\xc2\xa0 They do not give a lick about what day next week the President speaks before Congress.\xc2\xa0 They want to hear from him.\xc2\xa0 They want to know what his proposals are.\xc2\xa0 They want to know that he has reasonable, sound, serious ideas to grow the economy and to create jobs, and that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to pay for it and that he has a plan for getting our fiscal house in order in the long term.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they care about.\xc2\xa0 And they care whether or not Congress has similar ideas and is willing to take action on those ideas.\xc2\xa0 They simply do not care about this stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So let me concede your point -- they don\xe2\x80\x99t give a lick about what day it is, what time it is.\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he give a speech from the Oval Office tonight saying, here\xe2\x80\x99s my plan? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He wants to speak before Congress because he recognizes that while there are things he can do without Congress -- and he will do them -- there are actions that need to be taken with Congress that require legislation to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And he wants to go to Congress, speak directly to members of Congress, and lay out his proposals. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The first opportunity to do that is next week, so that\xe2\x80\x99s when he\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 The President visited the solar company Solyndra in May of 2010.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s here that companies like Solyndra are leading the way toward a brighter and more prosperous future.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You probably heard overnight that yesterday this company, after getting half a billion dollars in government money, attention from the President, a visit, is filing for Chapter 11 and laying off 1,100 people.\xc2\xa0 What does it say about the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies so far, as he gets ready for this new plan, if this company he promoted, gave government money to, is going bankrupt and is laying off 1,100 people?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The whole purpose of this program, which has a broad portfolio of many companies that are doing well, was to invest in cutting-edge technologies that with some government assistance, with some government loan guarantees, would help us establish a beachhead in vital industries that will allow America to compete in the future. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are no guarantees in the business world about success and failure.\xc2\xa0 That is just the way business works, and everyone recognizes that.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why -- there\xe2\x80\x99s over 40 companies, as I understand it, 40 guarantees involved in this program that merit looking at.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no individual -- you cannot measure the success based on one company or the other.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said several times today and yesterday that the President wanted to speak to Congress at the soonest possible opportunity when they get back.\xc2\xa0 Was this the plan all along, to give a speech to a joint session?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we discussed this as the President worked on his proposals and this was the idea settled upon.\xc2\xa0 And once we thought -- the conclusion was made, the President decided that this is what he wanted to do, then we moved forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that decision was made yesterday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was made this week. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was made this week.\xc2\xa0 Not to put too fine a point on it, but let me just ask you straight up -- did the President give in or capitulate to the Speaker on the schedule?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President wanted to speak to Congress.\xc2\xa0 Congress is back next Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the first day that both houses -- senators and Congressmen -- are back in session.\xc2\xa0 Therefore he requested that he speak Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 If Wednesday doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, Thursday is fine with us, as long as he gets to speak to Congress.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know you are loath to get into some of the details that are being discussed for the speech, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re going to go big, small, whatever, but the Mid-Session Review -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve just been treated to a conference call that forecasted an average unemployment rate of 9 percent through the course of 2012.\xc2\xa0 And you said that the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies, if enacted, will lower that rate.\xc2\xa0 Correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I will say that objective outside economic analysts will look at it and say, if enacted, this plan will have a positive impact on growth and a positive impact on job creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what is the target for growth and the target for the unemployment --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make projections here, nor am I going to get into details of the proposals.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve just been treated to a conference call where projections were -- that was what the call was about.\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the Mid-Session Review; that\xe2\x80\x99s not -- this is a new series of proposals the President is making next week.\xc2\xa0 And rather than preview them now --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are those proposals predicated on certain results, though, that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to see, and what is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into projections or show any more leg on the details of the speech.\xc2\xa0 What I am going to say is that there will be a series -- it will contain a series of proposals that are aimed at having a quick impact on economic growth and job creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carol.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they updating the Mid-Session Review?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask OMB.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how that process works.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you guys put it out a month and a half late, a week before the President delivers a new economic plan, making it completely --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of factors here.\xc2\xa0 This has obviously been quite an interesting budget year.\xc2\xa0 But these are separate issues here.\xc2\xa0 The President is moving forward with a job and growth proposal next week, and the obligations to put out a Mid-Session Review that came out today -- these are not connected in any specific sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So should we or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we expect an updated economic report --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just said you have to ask OMB.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how that works.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a time for the speech on Thursday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I can assure you that, for all you football fans, that he will be completed before kickoff between the New Orleans Saints and Green Bay Packers.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then if you could just clarify -- you said yesterday and you\xe2\x80\x99ve said today that the President and his team have consulted with Republicans on the Hill as he puts together this plan. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a slight --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered this about six times this week, but as I just said to Athena, the President has consistently throughout his presidency and including in recent weeks and months consulted with a wide array of folks within his administration, outside of his administration, in Congress, both parties, business and elsewhere, about economic ideas, proposals for growing the economy and creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 That has been true throughout.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been true through this process. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but he\xe2\x80\x99s putting forward a new plan with new ideas --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into did he have specific conversations with individual lawmakers --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because they say he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be something that he would want to do?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Have you talked to every member of Congress? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Republican leadership in Congress said that they have not been consulted as he was putting together his plan. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s consulted widely, as he always does.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s gathered ideas.\xc2\xa0 His economic team and he have put together proposals that we are quite confident, if Congress comes back to Washington filled with a righteous sense of urgency about the need to grow the economy and create jobs, they will act on it and do the right thing by the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can\xe2\x80\x99t definitively say whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s talked to Republicans --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I answered that question a half dozen times.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in the hours between the letter from Speaker Boehner and your statement at about 9:18 last night, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem as though you were saying, well, if Wednesday doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, Thursday is fine with us.\xc2\xa0 Did it go to the President and he said, all right, fine, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it on Thursday?\xc2\xa0 Is that what happened?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think we were -- it was clear that we were in conversation with the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office and looking at what the alternatives were.\xc2\xa0 And I think, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a matter of hours here, we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking days and weeks -- resolved that Thursday would be the day, and that was fine with us.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President made that decision last night?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President makes all the decisions here.\xc2\xa0 So we were discussing among ourselves, we were talking with the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office -- we decided to go with Thursday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if the address is done by kickoff, does that mean he sees the speech as the pregame show?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The decision was made by the Justice Department -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a law enforcement action.\xc2\xa0 And for any questions on what factors were considered, I encourage you to go to the Justice Department.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about -- of course the decision was made by them.\xc2\xa0 Was that in consultation in advance --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a Justice Department decision.\xc2\xa0 They look at the factors, they make the call.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but did the White House consult with them before they made their decision?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what your -- the Justice Department makes the -- they look at the factors, they make the decision about proceeding on a law enforcement action.\xc2\xa0 So I think you should ask them about what their considerations were.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Including what the White House\xe2\x80\x99s role was?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The White House did not have a role in making the decision; the Justice Department made the decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, has AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s lobbyist Jim Cicconi been to the White House today?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it possible to get an actual definitive answer on that?\xc2\xa0 Would you be able to help us to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just one question on Solyndra.\xc2\xa0 Should we assume that whatever money the taxpayers put into that in terms of loan guarantees, that is not going to be returned, that can\xe2\x80\x99t be returned, it\xe2\x80\x99s lost?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the technical details of it, but I can take that or refer you to OMB -- or Department of Energy probably.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a question about the speech next week.\xc2\xa0 You keep on saying that the proposals the President is going to lay out should have bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s quite different than saying you\xe2\x80\x99re designing a package that would have the best chance of passing.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, what is the goal?\xc2\xa0 Is the goal to just put out the proposals he believes --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you asked me this yesterday --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, and I -- well, no, I asked you on the plane --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tuesday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and it seemed like you said that they were designed to pass, which is what really worries a lot of your supporters, that you\xe2\x80\x99re designing a package that can pass and therefore will --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that it is a difficult process to know precisely what is in the hearts and minds of 535 elected members of Congress as they consider legislation.\xc2\xa0 What we know with great confidence is that the proposals the President will put forward next week are reasonable and reflect, based on historic precedent, historical precedent, what should be bipartisan -- should receive bipartisan support, and I think that will be judged that way when he unveils it on -- on Thursday, rather.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s different than saying these are designed -- this is a package designed to get Congressional support --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a distinction without a difference, because you could say that nothing could get congressional support, or you could say anything could get congressional support.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I mean, I think that, again, if members of Congress come back focused on the need to address the economy and hiring, they will view this proposal as an excellent path to take to grow the economy and create jobs, and a reasonable one, and one that merits broad support.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we believe, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re coming forward with it next week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last question following up on what Jonathan was asking, this idea that the President can\xe2\x80\x99t get something out of this Congress, not even a date to speak.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to judge this President on what he gets out of this Congress?\xc2\xa0 Or is it fair to judge him just on the proposals he lays out and his vision?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it is fair to judge the President on the actions he takes and the determination he shows to do what he was elected to do, which is, first and foremost, protect the American people and help the American people and the American economy.\xc2\xa0 And he has done that since he took office, and he will demonstrate that again next week.\xc2\xa0 That is his focus:\xc2\xa0 What can I do as President, either administratively or with Congress legislatively, to ensure that the American economy is best positioned to grow, that the private sector has the conditions that will allow it to hire and encourage it to hire, and that the American people can go back to work?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have been through a horrible situation -- the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 We here, I think -- Americans in general, we can have short-term memory, I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of what makes us great -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t spend our time wallowing in the past; we look towards the future.\xc2\xa0 It is important to remember what we are emerging from and how serious the economic recession was.\xc2\xa0 And this President has been focused on this since the day he took office, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be focused on it until, as he says, he knows that every American who wants a job and is looking for a job has a job.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could you say that -- could you just explain a little bit about what the President expects to do and see and hear when he goes to Paterson, New Jersey, on Sunday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he, I think as you saw throughout the process -- Hurricane Irene -- very concerned about the devastation the storm was likely to cause and did cause.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that it was not as severe as it could have been may be true, but we cannot lose sight of the fact that many, many Americans were severely affected by it, and some lost their lives.\xc2\xa0 And obviously New Jersey was a very hard-hit state.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to take a tour of the town or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll come out with more details about what his itinerary will look like on Sunday a little later.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, does he -- is going sort of for moral support or does seeing it firsthand better help him foment the government\xe2\x80\x99s continuing response?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that he\xe2\x80\x99s -- to see up close and personal what the effects of a storm like this were, to talk to local officials, talk to affected Americans, talk to first responders and to those officials who are working on recovery, and hear from them.\xc2\xa0 So he looks forward to doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Helene.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the White House feel that this President has gotten the respect from Congress that the office of the presidency deserves, with yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s incident?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The White House spends zero time worrying about that.\xc2\xa0 It spends its time -- we spend our time, the President spends our time focused on the job at hand.\xc2\xa0 The job at hand is to come up with, propose and act on the things that we can do to help the economy and to help job creation, specifically for next week -- and obviously all the other responsibilities that the President has and the White House and the administration have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no worry at all that there -- about the whole idea of the office of the presidency being demeaned?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s virtually unheard --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You guys are making --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- virtually unheard of for --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- you\xe2\x80\x99re really making so much more of this than is merited, okay?\xc2\xa0 The President will speak to the Congress in a joint session and to the American people next week.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important time for our country; it\xe2\x80\x99s an important time for the economy.\xc2\xa0 He will speak directly to the people about what we need to do to grow the economy and create jobs, and he looks forward to doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One on Solyndra.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any regrets about having made such a big deal about this company?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President -- the administration, the President is committed to, as I think I said, the idea that we need to make investments in clean energy technology, in the kind of industries that will be the -- that are the industries of the future, and that will be the job-creation engines in American in the future.\xc2\xa0 If we intend to be number one in the 21st century the way we have been in the 20th and the early part of this century, we need to make those key investments. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 American history is full of examples of the federal government providing seed money in areas that allowed for explosive and economy-changing growth in certain areas, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the Transcontinental Railroad or the Internet.\xc2\xa0 So the President is very committed to that, and, as I said before, that does not mean that each individual investment we made -- we do not change the rules of business by doing this.\xc2\xa0 And by nature these can be high-risk but also very high-reward investments, and we are committed to that process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have any regrets about this particular company --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just -- you know that some Republicans said they thought this particular company was a dubious proposition from the start --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there were Republicans who thought investments in clean energy were a mistake, that they were ready to cede that vital industry to foreign competition, they were ready to cede the automobile industry to foreign competition, a million jobs there.\xc2\xa0 We just disagree on that front.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you satisfied that this company got the scrutiny that it should have had from the outset?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I refer you to DOE on the particulars of the process.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied that this program was necessary and is working.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thank you.\xc2\xa0 When you say that the President will make some proposals in his address next week that will be things that he could do administratively, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he -- would that make up the bulk of his recommendations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I simply said that obviously -- what I meant, or meant to convey through that, is that he\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think I was asked why Congress, and that\xe2\x80\x99s because we need to act with Congress.\xc2\xa0 Much of -- some of what -- much of what we need to do requires legislation, requires action by Congress.\xc2\xa0 That is why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to go to Congress. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He can also do things, as he has in the past, administratively that can help the economy grow, that can -- for example, the regulatory look-back that can free -- relieve businesses from burdensome regulations; other measures he can take administratively that don\xe2\x80\x99t require legislative action, he will continue to do that as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that was not -- there are many pieces to this that are both legislative and administrative.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you think if he finishes by the time the kickoff comes at 8:35 p.m., he might also leave enough time for a Republican response during that time?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not -- again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific time yet for when he will begin speaking, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Glenn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just to follow on two points that you made.\xc2\xa0 You told Helene a couple minutes ago that you felt -- the President has sort of zero interest in the notion that the prestige of the office has been dented by this.\xc2\xa0 Should he have zero interest?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the prestige of the office a significant component of having leverage in these negotiations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just \xe2\x80\x93- what he has zero interest in, and what the American people have zero interest in, is the petty political gamesmanship that goes on in here and that gets chronicled quite assiduously by the press, which is fine.\xc2\xa0 But it is not what the American people care about, right?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, when they are forced to pay attention to it, they recoil in disgust.\xc2\xa0 And they -- (laughter) -- you know, go out there and talk to regular folks. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know you do, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what you hear.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what \xe2\x80\x93- when you go out into the country and you talk to ordinary Americans who are struggling to make ends meet, who are making sure they can get their car payments, ensuring that they\xe2\x80\x99re saving money for their kids\xe2\x80\x99 college education, who are coming up with great new ideas for -\xe2\x80\x93 to increase the productivity in their small business, tilling the field or working in the shop, they do not have any time for this.\xc2\xa0 They do not have any time for the pettiness, the smallness, the posturing.\xc2\xa0 And mostly they don\xe2\x80\x99t even pay attention to it.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think one of the things that I think that was so frustrating about what happened this summer is that because of the seriousness of the consequences of the posturing, they were forced to pay attention to it, and they were appalled by and scared by it.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what -\xe2\x80\x93 look, the President is focused on the big things, the things that matter.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the vast majority of the American people are focused on.\xc2\xa0 And I think that with any luck, that\xe2\x80\x99s what members of Congress will be focused on when they come back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other thing I wanted to follow on, you described the communication between the White House and the Hill as being \xe2\x80\x9cfine.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I think this might be the only room in Washington where you could say that without folks shouting you down.\xc2\xa0 To what extent do you think the fact that there was a communications gap with the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office -- it appears that this was done at the staff level -\xe2\x80\x93 do you have any regrets that the President himself didn\xe2\x80\x99t call up Speaker Boehner \xe2\x80\x93-<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- first of all, I think you need to fine tune your reporting on what happened, but I \xe2\x80\x93- and who was involved, but it is irrelevant.\xc2\xa0 It really is.\xc2\xa0 The President will speak to the nation and the Congress next week, as he hoped to do, and he will talk about some very important things that have nothing to do with communication gaps.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you really think communications between the White House and Hill Republicans are fine?\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you not see that there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I think is that the issues trump that kind of stuff.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the President has a working relationship with the Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve spent an awful lot of time together in person and on the phone this year.\xc2\xa0 They will continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 The same is true with the Democratic leaders of the House and the Senate, as well as obviously the Senate Republican leaders.\xc2\xa0 So -\xe2\x80\x93 and other leaders and members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 That will continue.\xc2\xa0 The issues matter far more than this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t think something has to be fixed?\xc2\xa0 You think the communications is fine?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think politics needs to be fixed.\xc2\xa0 Yes, the President says politics is broken.\xc2\xa0 The American people are fed up with this.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on the stuff that matters.\xc2\xa0 And I think, listening to their constituents, that Congress is going to focus on it, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Yes, the Boston Globe reported today on the President\xe2\x80\x99s uncle that had been arrested.\xc2\xa0 Was the President aware that his uncle was in the United States as an undocumented \xe2\x80\x93-<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He became aware of this story when I walked into his office and among other subjects mentioned it to him, and it was new to him on Monday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, is the administration committed to seeing that all U.S. laws are enforced in this case? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 We expect it to be treated \xe2\x80\x93- I refer you to ICE and DHS and expect it to be handled like any other immigration case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Steve.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I have a follow-up \xe2\x80\x93-<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Steve.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the things the President can do without Congress, you mentioned regulations.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some other examples of things he can do administratively or by executive order to create jobs?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to ruin the surprise. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s going to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, of course the President has certain powers.\xc2\xa0 The executive branch has certain things it can do, and we\xe2\x80\x99re always looking -- I refer to you \xe2\x80\x93- I talked yesterday about \xe2\x80\x93 on the housing front, the measures that were taken to assist the unemployed; unemployed homeowners.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a measure that can be taken at the executive level, administrative level to help homeowners on an economic issue.\xc2\xa0 There are just a variety of things we can do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a completely different subject, the President in Minneapolis reaffirmed his commitment to get all the troops out of Iraq by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 Former Prime Minister -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d trust your sources in Washington on this, and I would simply say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made significant progress at great sacrifice in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And the fact of the matter is that violence overall remains down significantly, and Iraqi security forces have demonstrated great improvements in their capacities to maintain security in that country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not perfect.\xc2\xa0 There are still incidents, no question.\xc2\xa0 And there are still folks there who have a great interest in being disruptive, but the accomplishments of American men and women over there are substantial.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember we turned over combat lead there quite a long time ago.\xc2\xa0 Iraqis have been in the security lead for a substantial period of time, and that progress continues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no question there are challenges ahead in Iraq, but substantial successes have been achieved.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
