b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>12:52 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me read a quick readout from a meeting the President held this morning.\xc2\xa0 The President had a productive video teleconference this morning with President Karzai.\xc2\xa0 The two leaders focused primarily on plans to stabilize Kandahar City and the close alignment between our two governments there.\xc2\xa0 They received a briefing from senior U.S. and Afghan officials detailing their plans to provide better security, improve governance and increase economic opportunities.</p>\n<p>The two Presidents agreed on the need to make tough decisions on a range of issues, including removing corrupt officials, eliminating sources of corruption and providing the people of Kandahar better access to government services.\xc2\xa0 They both emphasized their plans to monitor progress in Kandahar closely.\xc2\xa0 The two also agreed on the importance of the U.S.-Afghanistan long-term relationship, and plan to discuss the joint effort to negotiate a new strategic partnership declaration during their next conversation.</p>\n<p>And with that, Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the incendiary comments by General McChrystal and his aides?\xc2\xa0 And has the President spoken to the general about this yet?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President has not spoken with General McChrystal.\xc2\xa0 I think you all know that General McChrystal is on his way back to Washington, will take part in tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s planned Afghanistan meeting in the Situation Room.</p>\n<p>As Secretary Gates\xe2\x80\x99 statement says, he was recalled back to Washington to speak to Pentagon officials and to the President about the remarks that were made in that article.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal reaction?\xc2\xa0 What is it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, suffice to say the -- our combatant commander does not usually participate in these meetings from Washington.\xc2\xa0 The President has -- the President asked for him to come back to explain those remarks, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s on his way to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the story, McChrystal or his aides are quoted as ripping on the President, the Vice President, Eikenberry, Holbrooke.\xc2\xa0 How can the President keep someone in his job who offers that level of insubordination?\xc2\xa0 Does he plan to fire him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say, first and foremost, there are more than 90,000 of our bravest men and women in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And what we owe them is nothing short of our fullest support and our best efforts to get a new strategy in that country right.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus.\xc2\xa0 That should be everybody\xe2\x80\x99s focus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It was a strategy, as you all know, that was worked out in long consultation last fall and last winter, and the President went around to many of the people that will be in the Situation Room tomorrow asking them if they agreed with this new strategy and asked for their commitment to implement it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we owe the men and women that are fighting each and every day over there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, let me finish by saying that, again, the President will speak with General McChrystal about his comments, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say after that meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is McChrystal\xe2\x80\x99s job safe?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say after that meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that Peter Orszag is leaving the administration?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will there be any changes in fiscal policy?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say obviously Peter has served alongside a valuable and within a valuable economic team that has faced the greatest economic crisis that any President has faced since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It has taken -- it\xe2\x80\x99s an enormous task.\xc2\xa0 Peter has been instrumental in, for instance, this year\xe2\x80\x99s plan to freeze non-security discretionary spending for three years and has decided to leave before we get into the creation of the next budget.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been here for two budgets, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll look for a replacement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk at all about who his replacement might be?\xc2\xa0 And will there be any other departures from the economic team?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know of no other departures.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at a number of very talented candidates.</p>\n<p>Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President consider the remarks in the story from General McChrystal and his aides insubordination?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is looking forward to speaking with General McChrystal about those remarks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you characterize at all the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to hearing that aides for McChrystal called Vice President Biden \xe2\x80\x9cBite me\xe2\x80\x9d; McChrystal advisers said Obama clearly didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about McChrystal when they first met; here\xe2\x80\x99s a guy who\xe2\x80\x99s going to run his f-ing war; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem very engaged; the boss was pretty disappointed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll have his undivided attention tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President dispute the characterization that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t engaged in his first meeting with General McChrystal?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We look forward -- the President looks forward to speaking to him tomorrow about what\xe2\x80\x99s in that article.\xc2\xa0 We owe -- every member of this team, from the commanding general to anybody that works in this building, to anybody that works in the State Department or throughout the Pentagon, we owe it to -- as I said earlier -- the men and women that are fighting there to implement the policy that each agreed to.</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, General McChrystal, as Secretary Gates has said, has made an enormous mistake, a mistake that he\xe2\x80\x99ll get a chance to talk about and answer to tomorrow to both officials in the Pentagon and to the Commander-In-Chief.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President still have confidence that General McChrystal can run this war?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We should wait and see what the outcome of that meeting is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t General McChrystal talked to the President yet?\xc2\xa0 I mean, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President be the first person that he would pick up the phone, he would call and apologize directly to?\xc2\xa0 We know he\xe2\x80\x99s talked to Mullen and Gates and a whole bunch of other people.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- General McChrystal has not called the President.\xc2\xa0 The President has not called General McChrystal.\xc2\xa0 The President asked that General McChrystal come, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll get an opportunity to talk about this article face to face sometime tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President not want to hear from him right now?\xc2\xa0 He wants to wait for the -- a face-to-face meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think right now he\xe2\x80\x99s on a plane coming back here to have that face-to-face meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are the two of them going to be alone in addition to the Situation Room meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that, yes.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a time yet for a meeting for that, but yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President make a distinction -- Senator Carl Levin makes a distinction in the Congress.\xc2\xa0 He says that the disagreement is not over policy, per se, but he says it\xe2\x80\x99s over personalities, that this is -- would have a negative impact on implementing the policy.\xc2\xa0 Does the President make a distinction between the kind of criticism -- personality conflicts that are taking place in the Pentagon versus, okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re on the same page when it comes to policy?\xc2\xa0 Or does it matter?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes -- and I think most believe -- that personality differences aside, we\xe2\x80\x99re here to implement a new strategy, again, put together over the course of I think three months and 12 meetings in the Situation Room.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s our job to implement that strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that personalities, whatever your disagreements are or whatever your disagreements were, should distract from the strategy to get Afghanistan right.\xc2\xa0 The President talked throughout the campaign and throughout the time as we created this strategy in the Situation Room that this war effort in Afghanistan had for years been under-resourced.\xc2\xa0 Now there are on the order of four times the number of troops in Afghanistan -- or will be, I should say -- and coming into that country on a pace laid out in this new strategy.</p>\n<p>It is incumbent upon anybody involved to put aside whatever those differences are -- and this goes for any policy decision.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s a disagreement in a room here at White House, at the State Department, at the Pentagon, in a foreign capital throughout this world, it\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent upon those in the policymaking world to set aside those differences and implement the decisions that, in this case, the Commander-in-Chief has made in conjunction with both military and civilian officials.</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is removing the general from his position at least an option the President is considering?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prejudge the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is anxious to talk to him before he has anything else to say on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President know ahead of time whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s an option he\xe2\x80\x99s considering?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say all options are on the table.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Including firing him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think every option is on the table.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last year you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall when there were -- there was a series of leaks when these meetings in the Situation Room were going on, and the President very clearly said that that was a firing offense.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this worse than that?\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t this be a firing offense, this kind of insubordination?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I -- Chip, I think the magnitude and graveness of the mistake here are profound.\xc2\xa0 And the President took everyone to task last year for, as you said, the leaks that were coming out of those meetings.\xc2\xa0 He said there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason we don\xe2\x80\x99t have these meetings at Starbucks, that we have them in the Situation Room.\xc2\xa0 And he takes this seriously because we have -- because he has made a life-or-death decision to put people in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.</p>\n<p>And we owe it to those men and women -- some of whom are serving their third or fourth tour in Afghanistan or in Iraq -- we owe them our very best.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If McChrystal were not so vital to the mission in Afghanistan, would this be an easy decision?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say, Chip, I think that -- I think our efforts in Afghanistan are bigger than one person.\xc2\xa0 I think there was a strategy that was borne out of discussions on both the military and the civilian side.\xc2\xa0 We said this about Iraq, and it\xe2\x80\x99s true about Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 There is not a military solution alone to this problem, because -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this even in our efforts in Marja -- if you cannot hold an area, if you cannot create or if the type of governance structure cannot be created in order to secure that area, then you can\xe2\x80\x99t transfer it.</p>\n<p>So this is bigger than anybody on the military or the civilian side.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you with the President when he reacted in any way to this story?\xc2\xa0 And if so, how would you describe it?\xc2\xa0 Was he surprised?\xc2\xa0 Was he angry?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was -- I gave him the article last night.\xc2\xa0 And he was angry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How so?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Angry.\xc2\xa0 You would know it if you saw it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has McChrystal offered his resignation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, he\xe2\x80\x99s not met with the President so I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President accept McChrystal\xe2\x80\x99s resignation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he looks forward to the talk tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t pulling a general off the battlefield in the middle of war tantamount to saying that he expects him to offer his resignation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not prejudging the outcome of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The purpose for calling him here.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The purpose for calling him here is to see what in the world he was thinking.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a certain aspect to this that\xe2\x80\x99s serving as a shaming function?\xc2\xa0 Certainly he could elicit the information by a video teleconference.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is -- this goes far beyond the President, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear about this.\xc2\xa0 The meeting tomorrow -- and I think -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the manifest for you in the guidance -- there are a lot of people that are involved, right?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a diplomatic corps that has to -- that is sending civilians in to create the governance structure that I was speaking about.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got, as I said, men and women at all levels of the military involved in this.\xc2\xa0 This is a -- these are discussions that have -- I assume General McChrystal will have with more than just the Commander-in-Chief.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any aspect to this that\xe2\x80\x99s about, frankly, humiliating McChrystal?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think he spoke clearly to that in his statement, that -- I think that was taken care of largely in the article.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then last thing -- what bothered the President most about what he read?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That we\xe2\x80\x99re distracting from what the President considers to be an enormously vital mission for our country and for our Armed Forces.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re at an important time in seeking to make progress in a country that we have been in for a number of years.\xc2\xa0 We have dedicated, as I said, more men and women to this effort than have ever been dedicated before.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of work to do.\xc2\xa0 Our focus should be on that work.\xc2\xa0 Our focus should be on implementing this policy and on creating the security and the governance environment that allows our good men and women to come home.</p>\n<p>Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As soon as the Walter Reed scandal broke in The Washington Post, Secretary Gates fired the people involved -- didn\xe2\x80\x99t involve President Bush.\xc2\xa0 When the live nuclear weapons were put on a -- accidentally put on a bomber at Barksdale Air Force Base, Secretary Gates fired the people involved.\xc2\xa0 Why would you want to have General McChrystal in this White House and not have this handled by the Secretary, who has shown himself willing to make these tough decisions on his own?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a decision that will be made by the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 This is a -- as I said just a minute ago, this is an enormously important effort and we\xe2\x80\x99re at an enormously important time in that effort.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that General McChrystal ought to have an opportunity to discuss with him that article.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more thing on that.\xc2\xa0 General McChrystal has already had his woodshed moment with the President -- it happened last year after London.\xc2\xa0 How many times can this man be taken to the woodshed by the Commander-in-Chief?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll know more about that tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken a couple of times about what\xe2\x80\x99s owed to the people who are serving over there.\xc2\xa0 What should people put in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way make of their commander taking these kinds of shots at the Commander-in-Chief, and the comments made by his close aides about the Vice President, about General Jones, about Ambassador Eikenberry and others?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, we -- I think anybody that reads that article understands, as Secretary Gates talked about, what an enormous mistake this was, given the fact that mothers and fathers all over this country are sending their children halfway across the world to participate in this.\xc2\xa0 They need to know that the structure where they\xe2\x80\x99re sending their children is one that is capable and mature enough in prosecuting a war as important as Afghanistan is to our national security.\xc2\xa0 I think that is one of the things that the President will look to discuss tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does this do to the general\xe2\x80\x99s credibility with his own rank-and-file troops?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a question better asked for -- to those serving with him.\xc2\xa0 Look, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, General McChrystal is a -- has fought bravely on behalf of this country for a long time.\xc2\xa0 Nobody could or should take that away from him, and nobody will.\xc2\xa0 But there has clearly been an enormous mistake in judgment to which he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to answer to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick procedural question.\xc2\xa0 When they have the meeting in the Situation Room, so many of the people there who are targets of this criticism will be around the table.\xc2\xa0 Will each one of them have a chance to call him to task?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- you all may know more about calls that he has already made on this to different members that will be around that table or not.\xc2\xa0 Again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to speak about what the interaction would be like for that meeting since it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on one thing you said?\xc2\xa0 You said that the parents of soldiers need to be sure that the command structure in Afghanistan is capable and mature enough -- did I hear you correctly?\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re questioning whether or not General McChrystal is capable and mature enough to -- for this job he has?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You had my quote right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you said he was angry.\xc2\xa0 But I was wondering, in the larger sense, was the President\xe2\x80\x99s anger more having to do with what the comments seemed to say about respect for the chain of command?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Roger, it would be hard to limit -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I could focus like a laser on particular aspects.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably read the article, too, and you could guess there are a number of points in which anger might be your reaction.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it matter to the President that General McChrystal has apologized and is making these other calls to try to remedy the situation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In what way?\xc2\xa0 In what way will it affect the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision as to how this strategy can go forward and whether or not McChrystal is still the man he trusts to carry it forward?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think one of the question -- and obviously the President will get an opportunity to speak with other members on the team about the confidence in the structure that they have.\xc2\xa0 And, again, Major, I just do not want to prejudge the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to the President, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not fair to General McChrystal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President has taken note of that and it will factor into his consideration?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it matter to the President that President Karzai today, through a spokesman, said that he would like to continue to work with General McChrystal in the theater and that is generally supportive of him as the operations in Kandahar and elsewhere go forward?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is important that President Karzai have confidence in the entire team.\xc2\xa0 And I think many people enjoy -- at a number of different levels on that team, enjoy good relationships with President Karzai.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on Jake\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 So it would not be inaccurate for us to assume that from the President\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, General McChrystal\xe2\x80\x99s capability and maturity are now open to question?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think there are open questions based on actions that were reported in that article that the President seeks to speak to General McChrystal about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the underlying themes in the article, separate from General McChrystal\xe2\x80\x99s more controversial comments, is the frustration that rank-and-file soldiers have -- the rules of engagement and the frustration of dealing with the realities of trying to prosecute the counterinsurgency strategy on the ground on a day-to-day basis.\xc2\xa0 Separating McChrystal from that analysis and that theme in the article, how concerned is the President about that, that rank-and-file soldiers find themselves -- if they\xe2\x80\x99re being accurately represented in this article -- trapped by limiting and constricting rules of engagement?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not spoken with either the President or the team on that aspect of the article.\xc2\xa0 I would simply surmise that it is something that is -- has been and will be discussed in the past and in the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I will say that we know that -- we know that civilian -- we know what civilian casualties do to the mission.\xc2\xa0 We know what happens.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen both General McChrystal, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Ambassador Eikenberry, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen others -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President speak about the anguish of knowing that innocent civilians have been killed in these battles.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we know the effect that it has on the population, in which already believe -- which does not believe that the insurgency has their best interest in mind.</p>\n<p>So I will say that great care has been taken -- and you saw it in Marja -- great care is being taken in prosecuting a war that does not create amongst the general population sympathy towards those we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to defeat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition to feeling angry, does the President at all feel betrayed since McChrystal is there because the President decided he would be there and has largely backed McChrystal\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation for the counterinsurgency strategy itself?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I would simply sum it up as I have before in saying that over the course of many weeks a strategy was defined -- refined and developed, and that each member of the team pledged to implement and agreed with that strategy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we want anybody from the ambassador, to the combatant commander, to anybody else involved in this to focus on and focus on alone.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After the review last year, one of the things you all stressed -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it here again today -- is unity of purpose and consensus that you all had reached going forward.\xc2\xa0 Given both the general\xe2\x80\x99s comments, but also the sort of sense of dissention and disagreement that the article portrays between the various players, are you convinced that that kind of consensus still exists?\xc2\xa0 And if not --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can only take the word of those that sat in the Oval Office as the President went around person to person --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that was a lot of months ago, so I mean this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I understand, it just happened to be at a fairly pivotal moment at the point in which the President lays out a decision for a strategy and asks those involved, do you agree with my decision, and do you pledge to implement it.</p>\n<p>Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not speaking out of school to say there are disagreements in this building probably every hour of every day about what to do and when.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you could tell us more about those on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Like every hour.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But it is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s job to make those decisions, and it\xe2\x80\x99s our job to implement them -- not to re-litigate them, but to move forward based on what the President has decided.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t there be -- I mean, you know, that was many months ago, the times have changed.\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern that something needs to happen to make sure that the folks that are now pursuing this are still on that same page?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have -- the President gets, obviously, in his presidential daily briefing, in weekly memos from the combatant commanders, from the ambassadors and weekly meetings with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, and no one has walked into any of those meetings, and nobody has written in any memo that they disagree with the decision that they agreed with late last year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last just quick question.\xc2\xa0 The briefing that he got with Karzai and the senior officials today, I take it McChrystal had already departed and so was not part of that meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 This was a regularly scheduled SVTS with President Karzai.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, when you described the President, giving him the article and he got angry, had he read the whole -- were you with him when he read the whole article?\xc2\xa0 Or was it based on your highlights?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I had -- he had heard something, I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember who, about the existence of this article.\xc2\xa0 I walked the article over to the residence last evening.\xc2\xa0 He came back to the Oval Office on a couple of occasions.\xc2\xa0 I was not in the room when he --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was not in the room when he read the article, per se.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to here and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll come -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll come, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And who do you know -- whom did he talk to last night other than you about this?\xc2\xa0 Who did he call, email?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously General Jones, the Chief of Staff and many members of the national security team.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he talked to or heard from any of the NATO -- leaders of the NATO countries?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- no, the only call that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done today is with President Karzai.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last thing, would he have expected -- you said that General McChrystal had not called the President and the President has not called him -- would he have expected General McChrystal to try to call him by now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I think -- I think given the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve requested he come back for a meeting I think -- is let\xe2\x80\x99s say a meeting in lieu of a call, how about that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Briefly on that SVTS call, did the subject of McChrystal come up?\xc2\xa0 Did President Karzai, for example, voice support for him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe President Karzai -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen certainly the comments I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from his spokesperson.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that separately came up as part of the SVTS, but I can certainly -- I can check.</p>\n<p>Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 You said that the President was angry and that you would know it when you see it.\xc2\xa0 The problem is we\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen it.\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate a bit more?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you lucky?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he pounding -- did he pound the table?\xc2\xa0 Did he curse?\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jaw?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to elaborate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe McChrystal was in on the Karzai briefing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, he was not in on the SVTS, no.\xc2\xa0 He was either preparing for or on a plane back here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if you had not had this big meeting tomorrow, would the President have called him back anyway?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the kind of thing he\xe2\x80\x99d have --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you -- will he meet with the President privately in the Oval Office separately for the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a -- I do not have a time for that.\xc2\xa0 My assumption -- and did not have a full conversation with scheduling right before I came out here -- but the distinct impression I was given was that that would be at some point tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And separately from that, looking back over the weekend, is the anger at Tony Hayward for going to a yacht race justified, do you think?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the President ever consider whether a weekend golfing trip for himself is something that he --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get in the business of deciding what people do on the weekends.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Hayward, at one point, said he wanted his life back.\xc2\xa0 It appears that this past weekend, he got it back.\xc2\xa0 And maybe he forgot about -- at least for some stretch of time -- in the clear waters of a race what was happening back in the Gulf with polluted waters with people whose lives have been shattered and who can\xe2\x80\x99t readily assume the life they had as Mr. Hayward has.</p>\n<p>I think more than anything, the President conveyed this in the meeting with BP.\xc2\xa0 We should be cognizant in our dealings with this about those that have lost their livelihoods, have seen their lives shattered, and who are facing an uncertain future.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for Mr. Hayward.\xc2\xa0 I can speak for the President that he is -- and has been for going on now nine weeks -- been enormously focused on ensuring that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we possibly can in that region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I will say, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- the President has an enormous number of duties.\xc2\xa0 The President has an enormous number of activities because of the job that he has.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody is going to say that the President shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have an Afghanistan meeting because there\xe2\x80\x99s -- because of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the Gulf, just like nobody would say -- and vice versa.\xc2\xa0 The President has -- and has for the better part of now 17 months -- had a lot on his plate.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On North Korea, does the United States have any separate plan to initiate economic or financial sanctions against North Korea before the U.N. Security Council resolution comes up?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the Security Council through -- partly through U.S. leadership and certainly other leadership -- has, in Resolution 1874, placed a serious -- placed serious sanctions on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 And we will work with our South Korean counterparts through the United Nations on those next steps.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A number of initiatives at the agency level have aimed at leveling the playing field for same-sex partners.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the expansion of the Family Medical Leave Act, the hospital visitation -- extending certain benefits, limited benefits to same sex partners.\xc2\xa0 Was there ever a decision made within the White House to chip away at the inequities faced by LGBT families that -- sort of at the agency level rather than going straight at DOMA, to chip away at it at the agency level?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think many of the things that the President is instituting -- I mean, hospital visitation was something that the President always talked about during the campaign.\xc2\xa0 So I think many of the things that you see happening implemented by this White House are implementing promises that the President made on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 And obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s -- there are things that you can do to demonstrate your values through executive action, which is what he\xe2\x80\x99s working through.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any announcements today that -- anything new at the LGBT pride event?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will be honest with you, I have not read the remarks -- but let me see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 The President has expressed concerns in the past about leaks coming from the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 We now have this episode.\xc2\xa0 Is the President worried that this crop of military leaders may not accept the basic principle of civilian control of the military?\xc2\xa0 And also --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard anybody, including the President, say that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me go here, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Steny Hoyer said you all should seriously reconsider extending the Bush tax cuts for those making less than $250,000 and that you should do this in the next couple of weeks because of its impact on the debt.\xc2\xa0 What does the White House think about this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the comments.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to look at and try to get a response after this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the Gates meeting still on for today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 3:15 p.m., yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will the President specifically ask Gates for a recommendation on what to do with McChrystal?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I know that obviously this will be the primary topic of the meeting.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just going back to BP here for a second, we continue to get updates by Admiral Thad Allen -- Allen is one of them -- the ongoing response.\xc2\xa0 I understand that Allen worked with retired General Russel Honor\xc3\xa9 in Katrina, during the Katrina -- has there been any talks about maybe bringing him out of retirement to work with --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 General Honor\xc3\xa9?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the President would mind working -- pulling him out of retirement to have him work on this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President -- you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about for the Gulf, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I realize we\xe2\x80\x99re moving people around, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a joke -- (laughter) -- a moment of levity in an otherwise somewhat serious meeting.</p>\n<p>I have not heard -- again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the name specifically come up.\xc2\xa0 I would say that if the President believed that adding anybody to the structure of our response, if that helped that response, that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to do it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what is the expectation of a commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan in conducting an interview?\xc2\xa0 And also --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What are the what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When conducting an interview, and did this interview go through regular channels for request?\xc2\xa0 Did the interview request go through regular channels?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a question for his staff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- this White House has asked, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That kind of interview request would not come to my desk.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In light of everything though, you would probably find out all -- make sure all the I\xe2\x80\x99s were dotted and T\xe2\x80\x99s were crossed in light of everything that\xe2\x80\x99s happened, right?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think many of us found out about the I\xe2\x80\x99s and the T\xe2\x80\x99s when we were reading the article last evening.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, well, what is the expectation -- the level of expectation here at the White House for a U.S. commander in Afghanistan to deliver in an article for an interview?\xc2\xa0 What is the level of expectation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m missing -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you expect out of him?\xc2\xa0 I mean, clearly you\xe2\x80\x99re very upset with what he said.\xc2\xa0 You said it\xe2\x80\x99s a personality --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I take him at his word that -- in his apology he believes he\xe2\x80\x99s also made a big mistake as well.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President has asked him to come halfway back across the world to talk about it, so I think that speaks to the President\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint on the article.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But either way it\xe2\x80\x99s out there, it\xe2\x80\x99s in print now.\xc2\xa0 And do you think that this personality conflict has prevented a win, or at least helped to inhibit a win in Afghanistan of late -- in this last --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, we are in the process of implementing the strategy that we spoke of earlier.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re on pace in getting new forces into the country.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody -- certainly anybody that sat through those meetings would be under the illusion that the pace of progress would be enormously quick.\xc2\xa0 We understand that this is going to take some time and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re working through.</p>\n<p>John.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up to Steve\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 One of the biggest challenges for the administration and for Congress is striking a balance between spending in the short term that you need to -- believe you need to support the economy, and watching debt and deficits in the long run.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think it has been so hard to persuade the American people and Congress to strike that balance?\xc2\xa0 And do you think the departure of Budget Director Orszag is any indication that he\xe2\x80\x99s uncomfortable with how the administration is resolving those two priorities?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If he\xe2\x80\x99s uncomfortable he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t told that to anybody here or to the President.\xc2\xa0 Look, we are -- we face unique challenges, as I said, unseen economically since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 This economic team and the President strongly believe that a Recovery Act that we passed was desperately needed.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt, regardless of how you voted in January and February on that legislation, that we have seen as a result of that, increased growth, we have seen a lessening of those losing their jobs, and we have taken an economy on the edge possibly of another depression -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve now seen a path, albeit fragile, a path toward greater recovery.</p>\n<p>The President, at the same time, spoke of -- and I think this has been the agreement among staff and the economic team -- that we have to take steps in the medium and long term -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined certainly steps recently to get rid of wasteful spending, spending that may not -- take, for instance, since it\xe2\x80\x99s the topic today, take for instance what the Pentagon has done on procurement.\xc2\xa0 Nobody here is going to tell you that procurement reforms are going to solve, in and of themselves, a structural deficit.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that if we\xe2\x80\x99re doing things in a wasteful fashion we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop doing those.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President believes that in the short term, even as we take steps in the medium and the long term to get our fiscal house in order.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d say the one place where they all overlap is I think everybody would -- I think most economists would readily agree that it is going to be harder to close that structural deficit without sustained economic growth -- without job creation certainly the likes of which we did not have the months leading up to the President taking office and the depths of which we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen for quite some time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why is it so hard to get Congress to pass extended unemployment benefits, aid to states for Medicaid, money to avoid teacher layoffs, that sort of thing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we continue to work with Congress on all of those things.\xc2\xa0 They are -- obviously we believe unemployment insurance, continued job creation, ensuring that -- it certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make a whole lot of sense for our investment in education to lose teachers or to have schools that we have in some states that are already operating on a four-day-a-week schedule.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the harshest words in the article that were attributed directly to General McChrystal were about Ambassador Eikenberry, about his pessimism, his doubts about the effectiveness of the Karzai government.\xc2\xa0 At this point, does the President have full confidence in Ambassador Eikenberry?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we have -- I think most of the comments that were made were about disagreements that were had prior to those meetings last year where a strategy was put forward and everybody said they agreed with that strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, this goes -- this is true not just for anybody in the Rolling Stone article -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this a few times and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it one more time -- this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about us.\xc2\xa0 It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be about the personalities and the egos; it should be about the men and women that are there doing the hard work under some of the toughest conditions in the world.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that the President will say tomorrow that it is time for everyone involved to put away their petty disagreements, put away their egos, and get to work implementing a strategy that we all agreed had the best chance for our success in Afghanistan in the coming years.</p>\n<p>George.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there petty disagreements beyond those of General McChrystal?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look -- yes.\xc2\xa0 I would -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- if I picked up a newspaper from the past couple months and threw it on the floor, I bet I could find some background sniping about this group or this aspect of -- I think the President message is get over it.</p>\n<p>George.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer his question on whether the President has confidence in Eikenberry.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President has confidence in the team that pledged to implement a policy that they devised and agreed upon.</p>\n<p>George.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, you said no decision will be announced on the general\xe2\x80\x99s future until after the meeting tomorrow.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But has the President made up his mind?\xc2\xa0 Has he made the decision yet?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If he has, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t told me.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen you as angry as you seemed to be for the first 20 minutes of this briefing, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you wanted to give us a reading --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lucky you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are a number of people that would like to be on background in the first few rows that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The first three rows disagree with that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t agree more.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what all these people --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could give us your personal feelings at reading this article?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- my job is not to give my personal feelings.\xc2\xa0 My job is to give you all, as I do, the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking and the team\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it fair to say you were angry?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it anger I saw?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you pounding --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Call Tapper right after this.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not anger.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have one more, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last week, on the same date that the BP chair was talking about the \xe2\x80\x9csmall people,\xe2\x80\x9d former Senator Alan Simpson was making remarks about Social Security recipients being lesser persons in this country.\xc2\xa0 And as a result, groups like MoveOn are calling for him to step down or be removed as the chair of the Deficit Commission.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you had any reaction to the comments or any reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would love to look at them, but I have not seen them.</p>\n<p><br/>\nYes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Seen the comments?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I have not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on the NATO issue, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that with all the concern about NATO participation with Germany, Britain, that there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a phone call.\xc2\xa0 Will there be a phone call between now and the time any decision is made?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 With members of our NATO coalition?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 NATO leadership and the individuals --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me check the schedule.\xc2\xa0 I know the President has a number of pre-scheduled calls as we head to the G20 where he will see a number of our important partners.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, it goes without saying that we have asked an enormous amount of our Armed Forces.\xc2\xa0 We have also asked for the cooperation and the continued commitment of our NATO partners, and out of the review last year, asked for an additional commitment -- not all of which has been easy for those countries certainly in Europe.</p>\n<p>And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that one of the things that -- given what we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked of our partners, that was ---- what is in the article about that is in certainly no way helpful to our boarder coalition efforts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think the question is whether or not the President would seek their input before he would make any decision on the general\xe2\x80\x99s future.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 Let me check and see what is -- (telephone rings) -- is my pizza ready?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the -- let me look at the schedule and see whether -- my sense is the President will largely make this decision on his own.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any conversations with Senator Levin or Skelton -- Congressman Skelton on --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, none that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, to the Gulf, is there any discussion between the administration and BP over what should be done if the relief well fails in all this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not had a chance to read Admiral Allen\xe2\x80\x99s briefing today.\xc2\xa0 I think some of that came up.\xc2\xa0 There are -- as you know, we directed two relief wells to be drilled.\xc2\xa0 The first one -- the second one started after the first one, and part of that had to do with the use of different blowout preventers possibly on the failed blowout preventer.*\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They\xe2\x80\x99re at different levels and at different ranges in terms of finding and intersecting with the original well.\xc2\xa0 There are discussions that continue to take place and direction that\xe2\x80\x99s given by us on increased containment.\xc2\xa0 But let me check specifically on relief wells.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Prior to the publication of this article, was the President pleased with the performance of General McChrystal as Commander of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that -- I think that the President was and I think the President has -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this, understanding that, again, we are -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody was under the illusion that we would -- that all the progress would be quick and easy, that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time and that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons that everyone gets together as they do both in the region in Afghanistan, Pakistan and here for these monthly meetings.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a judge in New Orleans has just ruled to block President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s moratorium on offshore drilling.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you -- this was anticipated -- I was wondering if you have any response.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We will immediately appeal to the 5th Circuit.\xc2\xa0 The President strongly believes, as the Department of Interior and the Department of Justice argued yesterday, that continuing to drill at these depths without knowing what happened is -- does not make any sense and puts the safety of those involved -- potentially puts the safety of those on the rigs and safety of the environment in the Gulf at a danger that the President does not believe we can afford right now.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 1:47 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>* Remarks from a briefing on the BP Deepwater oil spill by National Incident Commander, Admiral Thad Allen, referenced by Press Secretary Robert Gibbs during the White House Press briefing, regarding options if the BP relief wells are unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN BRIEFING | JUNE 22, 2010:<br/>\nRichard Faussett:\xc2\xa0 Hi, Admiral Allen.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about the worst-case scenarios going forward?\xc2\xa0 What happens if the relief wells don\xe2\x80\x99t work out?\xc2\xa0 How long could this go on, and what kinds of other contingencies have been drawn up?\xc2\xa0 What kinds of conversations are you guys having about those possibilities?</p>\n<p>Adm. Allen: Well, first of all, we\xe2\x80\x99re mitigating risk on the relief well by drilling a second relief well alongside it.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully that won\xe2\x80\x99t be needed.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Salazar and Secretary Chu had a meeting last week in Washington with other industry representatives beyond BP, other oil-producing companies that are out there, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually identified a couple of platforms that are in the area that might be capable of taking the product coming out of the wellbore through pipelines and either producing it or putting it back down into the reservoir.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re exploring that over the next couple of days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If we\xe2\x80\x99re able to do that, that would give us an option of controlling the flow without having any surface vessels there, to some extent.\xc2\xa0 That wouldn\'t be the capacity we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for, but that would be another risk mitigator to handle some of the oil.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in exploratory conversations, and again, that was as a result of a meeting that we held last week where we asked industry to basically unconstrain their thinking and see what they could do for us.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re actually looking at whether or not there are dormant wells out there we could use as alternate production facilities.</p>\n<p>Operator:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your next question is from Ray Henry of the \xe2\x80\x9cAssociated Press.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Ray Henry:\xc2\xa0 Admiral, Ray Henry.\xc2\xa0 Wanted to see if you could explain a little bit about what you just talked about, putting the oil potentially back in the reservoir.\xc2\xa0 Give us a little bit of a sense of where those conversations stand, what you\'d be looking at.\xc2\xa0 Would this be a production platform that would be brought in to do this? Would you need to drill a new well to accomplish that?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the first time I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard anyone speak of that.</p>\n<p>Adm. Allen: Well, it is the first time we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had some communications with BP.\xc2\xa0 At the industry meeting that was held last week hosted by Secretary Salazar and Secretary Chu, we were looking at alternatives that would help us increase capacity, and there was an idea in the room among all the people that were talking, and this is the reason we bring other people in and ask them continually searching for new and better ways to do this.\xc2\xa0 They talk about whether or not within the immediate area where this well was being drilled, if there were other production facilities that are already there \xe2\x80\x93 that could be used if we were to extend the pipeline along the bottom of the ocean, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The question of how many of those might be available and the capacity that we could generate is all being looked at right now through a series of letters of request for information that we are working, but it is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re actively looking at because it could allow us to continue production out of that well without the \xe2\x80\x93 requiring a service vessel to be there, which is problematic, as you know when a hurricane.</p>\n<p>Ray Henry:\xc2\xa0 So you would extend a pipeline back into the reservoir to return the oil in a loop, or would it go to someplace else?</p>\n<p>Adm. Allen: No. We would extend the pipeline to an existing facility that\xe2\x80\x99s not being used for well production right now that has access to a different reservoir.</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
