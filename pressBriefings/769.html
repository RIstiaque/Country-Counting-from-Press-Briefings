Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>10:32 A.M. EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the first gaggle of the second term.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Historic.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Precisely.\xc2\xa0 The first only comes once.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, as you know, the President is -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the President later this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 He has a personnel announcement, and therefore I decided to move my meeting with you to the morning, do an off-camera gaggle, something that a number of you have asked that we do a little more frequently and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to oblige.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to do this -- for those of you who aren\xe2\x80\x99t familiar with it -- kind of try to, in keeping with tradition -- efficient, no seven questions for members of the first row before we get to move it around.\xc2\xa0 Maybe one way that I think this has been done is sort of one topic per person so we can move around, try to do this in 20 minutes, and so you guys can get back to work.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the Associated Press.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 On the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s announcement on women in combat, can you explain what the President\xe2\x80\x99s role was in that decision?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President is very pleased with the announcement that Secretary Panetta and Chairman Dempsey will be making official on this important policy change later today.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the Secretary and the Chairman discuss the details.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President fully supports this effort to expand opportunities for women, to serve in our armed forces.\xc2\xa0 As you know, women are already serving in critical roles throughout our military, and the President believes strongly that we should continue to remove these unnecessary gender-based barriers to service.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDespite the existence of these barriers heretofore, as you know, women have fought and bled and died in Iraq and Afghanistan in uniform, and the President believes that this is a very appropriate policy change.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he ask Secretary Panetta to take this on?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is something that he and the Secretary have discussed in their regular meetings over time.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, this is a decision that is generated by the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary, which is appropriate -- not a directed decision.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly one that the President believes is appropriate, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a position he\xe2\x80\x99s held for some time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does he think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for women to serve in all combat forces, including Special Forces, like the SEALs or the Delta Force?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Secretary Panetta and Chairman Dempsey talk about the details this afternoon before we go into the details here.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate given that this is a military decision that\xe2\x80\x99s being I think recommended by the Joint Chiefs to the Secretary, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll let them present.\xc2\xa0 And then I\xe2\x80\x99m sure tomorrow I can take more questions on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, North Korean officials have made some belligerent comments, including talking about how there are rockets and tests targeted at the United States.\xc2\xa0 Could you comment on that, and also talk about whether any repercussions are in the offing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s statement is needlessly provocative, and a test would be a significant violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.\xc2\xa0 Further provocations would only increase Pyongyang\xe2\x80\x99s isolation, and its continued focus on its nuclear and missile program is doing nothing to help the North Korean people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, the U.N. Security Council in a resolution adopted just two days ago expressed its determination to take significant action in the event of a further launch or nuclear test.\xc2\xa0 Resolution 2087 is a strong message of the international community\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s provocations, and these tightened sanctions will help impede the growth of weapons of mass destruction programs in North Korean programs -- in North Korea rather -- and the United States will be making -- taking additional steps in that regard.\xc2\xa0 But I have nothing more for you on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do these comments tell you anything about the direction of the regime of Kim Jong-un?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we judge North Korea by its actions, and provocations like these are significant violations.\xc2\xa0 And we act accordingly.\xc2\xa0 We certainly haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a noticeable change in behavior.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John Boehner -- Speaker Boehner was quoted saying that \xe2\x80\x9cthe President\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to annihilate the Republican Party.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the President about that, but I know it\xe2\x80\x99s not his goal.\xc2\xa0 His goal is to work together with Congress, with members of both parties to achieve progress on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 You heard him say in the inaugural address that even though we have profound differences and differences that we will not resolve necessarily in the next year or two or three or four, it is imperative that we come together and act on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And there are things that we can and must do together.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President believes that a strong two-party system is the foundation of our democracy and looks forward to working with Republicans as well as Democrats to get things done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t object to the annihilation of the Republican Party, would he?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he would object to -- he believes that the two-party system is part of the foundation of our democracy, and that it is a healthy aspect of our democracy even if it\xe2\x80\x99s contentious.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOurs is not the only politics in the world that is contentious and appropriately so.\xc2\xa0 What he believes, however, is that we need to have spirited debates but not debates that paralyze us.\xc2\xa0 We need to compromise, not be absolutists, but agree that the call -- that the need to act on behalf of the American people should compel us to make reasonable compromise while we stick to our principles.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the approach he\xe2\x80\x99s taken since he entered the White House, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the approach he intends to take in the second term.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Without betraying anything that happened in his private conversations on Inauguration Day, second Inauguration Day, did anything in any of his meetings with the leaders who were here or up on the Hill lead him to believe that there will be more comity, or was there any -- c-o-m-i-t-y --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I applaud the use of that word.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- or goodwill, or was there any exchange of promises?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any specific information about conversations that took place on Inauguration Day.\xc2\xa0 I think that it was appropriately a day where we celebrated as Americans, not as Democrats or Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And it is a remarkable thing that we have, without drama, these peaceful transitions of power or extensions of time in office.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something to celebrate as Americans, and the President feels that way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we -- as I said yesterday, I believe, and previous to that, some of the decisions that Republicans have made recently, including a decision to abandon a strategy in their approach to the debt ceiling, is a welcome development.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOne of the things that the President believes firmly is that we are not helping ourselves or helping the American people, or helping the American economy when we govern from crisis to crisis -- manufactured crisis to crisis.\xc2\xa0 And we understand -- he understands that there will be tough negotiations over how to further reduce our deficit, for example, in a balanced way, but that we can do that if we, all of us, approach the task with compromise in mind and not confrontation and crisis.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEven with some of the positive signs we\'ve seen and avoiding the debt ceiling crisis, I think there are Republican leaders on record saying they want a shutdown, for example, because it would be good for member management.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a hard thing to sell to the American people, right?\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a great strategy, I think in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xc2\xa0 But, again, we\'ll see how things unfold.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to working cooperatively with members of both parties in Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, which of those regulated by the SEC know about Mary Jo White\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications?\xc2\xa0 And does it suggest a new level of aggressiveness of regulatory enforcement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can confirm that the President, later today, will announce his intention to nominate Mary Jo White to serve as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll obviously leave some of this to the President, but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly out there and been confirmed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMary Jo White -- for those of us, as you were, here in the \xe2\x80\x9890s, know of her extraordinary record as a U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York.\xc2\xa0 I mean, she prosecuted a number of large-scale white-collar crimes in complex securities and financial institution fraud.\xc2\xa0 She brought justice to the terrorists responsible for the bombing of the World Trade Center and for the bombing of American embassies in Africa.\xc2\xa0 She also served as a director of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, the SEC plays an essential role in the implementation of Wall Street reform and rooting out reckless behavior in the financial industry.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that that appointment and the other one -- the re-nomination he\xe2\x80\x99s making today -- demonstrate the commitment that he has to carrying out Wall Street reform, making sure that we have the rules of the road that are necessary and that are being enforced in a way that ensures we don\'t have the kind of financial crisis that we had that led to the worst economic crisis that we\'ve seen since the Great Depression.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t mess with the SEC.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, she\'s got an incredibly impressive r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9, and the President is very pleased to be able to nominate her.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, to follow up -- the debt ceiling having now been shuffled back to May, the next deadline is the return of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to submit a proposal of his to replace the sequester, which he doesn\'t like?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has submitted a proposal, as you know, and as I said yesterday, that proposal stands.\xc2\xa0 He has put forward significant spending cuts and additional revenues gleaned from tax reform and closing of loopholes and capping of deductions that would significantly go beyond, in terms of size, the sequester.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought that\'s a larger-scale thing --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 But the whole point of a big deal was that it would eliminate both the sequester and achieve broader deficit reduction for the long term, and that the President still believes that we need to come together to finish the job; that instead of doing in whole, we\'ve been doing in steps to achieve $4 trillion-plus over a decade of deficit reduction through spending cuts, entitlement reforms, and increased revenues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the way he\'s going to attack this is to go back to trying to get the big deal, as opposed to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have specifics to play out for you in terms of what tactical approaches we\'ll take.\xc2\xa0 But the President\'s broad principle and the specifics of how he believes we can responsibly cut spending as opposed to taking a hatchet in an across-the-board way, which is what the sequester does -- and nobody supports that enactment.\xc2\xa0 And as a counter to that, he\'s put forward very specific proposals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying that the immediate deadline is the sequester.\xc2\xa0 So he\'s not going to try and deal just with the sequester?\xc2\xa0 He could --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\'re asking me what like specifically we may have to propose for that in however many weeks or months.\xc2\xa0 Broadly speaking, the sequester is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Four weeks away.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, so weeks -- fair, right?\xc2\xa0 Or a month.\xc2\xa0 Anyway, I don\'t have anything specific for you beyond what the President has already put on the table, which is detailed and substantial and which the President looks forward to discussing with congressional leaders.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, we know that probably a few minutes from now, Dianne Feinstein is going to introduce the assault weapons ban.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President will be in Richmond tomorrow with the Governor and some others discussing this.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a little bit of a sense -- given the fact that for a lot of Democrats this is challenging, sort of treacherous territory -- how the White House views pursuing what were three of his top priorities, which are magazines, assault weapons, and background checks if the order by which you pursue that is significant and how he sort of prioritizes going about that to be able to accomplish the biggest change?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to lay out to you a legislative strategy.\xc2\xa0 We\'re obviously working with Senator Feinstein and other leaders in Congress on this matter.\xc2\xa0 As the President made clear, the fact that some of these are hard to achieve -- all of them in many ways are hard to achieve, some of his goals -- doesn\'t mean that we should not work aggressively to achieve them.\xc2\xa0 There\'s broad public support for taking action.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNot a single one of the President\'s proposals that he put forward last week would take a gun away from a single, law-abiding American citizen.\xc2\xa0 He believes that the Second Amendment right to bear arms is important and he supports it.\xc2\xa0 But we ought to be able to take common-sense measures to reduce the amount of gun violence in this country and to increase the amount of security for our people, most especially our children.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does pursuing the assault weapons ban first not make it more challenging to pursue the others, given that\'s the one with the most opposition?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just don\'t have a lot of process answers to give you and tactical or strategic answers to give you.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working with Congress.\xc2\xa0 The things you\'ve mentioned are the -- represent the legislative portion of the President\'s proposals, and they mirror in many ways action that members of Congress, Senator Feinstein as you mentioned being one of them, want to take.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll work with them on moving forward with congressional leaders on how they will move forward on these proposals.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President made clear that he will use the power of his office, as will the Vice President, to help bring about these important reforms.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRobert.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 A two-parter.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect any troubles with Cordray and the confirmation this time, given the recess appointment history last time?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say two things.\xc2\xa0 One, when the President nominated Richard Cordray to this very important post, which provides important reforms to protect consumers, he was widely praised by Republicans and Democrats.\xc2\xa0 He had worked with Republicans and Democrats in his position in Ohio.\xc2\xa0 There were no objections on substance to his nomination.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, it was blocked because -- for political considerations, because some folks in Congress don\'t believe that we should have an effective Consumer Finance Protection Bureau.\xc2\xa0 The President strongly disagrees.\xc2\xa0 The American people strongly disagree.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHopefully, the fact that Richard Cordray has substantial bipartisan support out in the country and at the time -- and we can provide that to you -- was praised by Republicans and Democrats -- former Attorneys General, as he was -- hopefully it will convince the Senate to move forward and allow the up-or-down vote that he deserves.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you expect clear sailing then pretty much?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what I said at all.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to predict an outcome except to say that there are no objections to him on substance.\xc2\xa0 He is absolutely the right person for the job.\xc2\xa0 He has done an excellent job in his position, and the President hopes very much the Senate will confirm him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Can you update us a little bit on Jack Lew?\xc2\xa0 Mr. Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s last day I believe is either today or tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t see him today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know when his -- I can\'t remember.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you expecting an acting --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to predict how the Senate will handle any particular nomination.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s prerogative to confirm nominees.\xc2\xa0 The President feels very strongly that Jack Lew is an excellent and highly qualified nominee, and we hope -- he hopes that the Senate will move expeditiously to confirm him.\xc2\xa0 We have a highly qualified deputy Treasury Secretary who remains in place -- Neal Wolin.\xc2\xa0 And again, we just -- we hope the Senate moves quickly.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 On immigration, has the President given any more thought on moving forward on immigration -- whether you can do it in one full package, whether he\xe2\x80\x99ll end up breaking it up into separate pieces?\xc2\xa0 And has he reached out at all to Marco Rubio whose plan has been out there, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s has been somewhat receptive --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a plan and I don\'t think anybody else has.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s spoken about it.\xc2\xa0 And the principles, as I said the other day, reflect very closely the blueprint that is available on WhiteHouse.gov for the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to comprehensive immigration reform, and we find that a good thing.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President looks forward to working with Congress, members of both parties.\xc2\xa0 He has always said that this is the kind of thing that has to be bipartisan and has in the past enjoyed bipartisan support from Republican leaders as well as rank-and-file senators and members of Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPresident George W. Bush, as you know, was a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, as was Senator McCain.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to working with Republicans and Democrats in achieving comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 He does absolutely believe that we need to do this in a comprehensive way, that that\'s the appropriate way to move forward to ensure that we put in place the kind of comprehensive reform that achieves all the goals that are necessary here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How soon will we see something --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that he intends to act very quickly --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How soon?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to hem him in by putting a timetable on it, but I think you can expect him to be true to his word, which is to take up this issue very early in his second term.\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, this is the third full day of his second term.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think John, I said, and then Peter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two more, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Will the President ask or has he already asked the Vice President to take a lead role in dealing with Congress on these budget issues -- sequester and debt ceiling?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Vice President has always played an important role in these issues and will continue to play.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a set negotiation right now over these issues, but the Vice President has and always will play a role in working with Congress on financial and budget issues, on issues related to gun violence and immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s one of the things that the President counts on with the Vice President, is being able to have the Vice President take a role because of his substantial relationships on Capitol Hill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are we talking about the kind of direct and active role that we saw him play in December on the fiscal cliff?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think we\'re in a position to say how the endgame of these things will play out.\xc2\xa0 We hope that this moves forward in a way that allows us to achieve a bipartisan solution that is balanced, that protects seniors and families with disabled children, people trying to send their kids to college; that reforms entitlements in a way that strengthens them, makes sure they\xe2\x80\x99re there for future generations; that enacts tax reform that makes sure that corporations and wealthy individuals are paying their fair share and that the burden is not being borne entirely by the middle class or vulnerable communities.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd those are the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re embodied in the proposals he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward.\xc2\xa0 And his entire team will be working with Congress to try to achieve them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPeter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I go back to the first question on the women in combat?\xc2\xa0 The way you suggested it makes it sounds like the President was more of a passive player rather than a decider on this.\xc2\xa0 Were there deputy meetings?\xc2\xa0 Were there principal meetings?\xc2\xa0 Is this something that the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a process to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 I would ask you to wait for the formal announcement later today from Secretary Panetta and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is something the President has supported, believes is important.\xc2\xa0 I think it in many ways formalizes a reality that has been taking place on the ground, but it also opens up enormous possibilities in terms of positions for women in the armed forces, and the President views that as a very, very good development.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s also very important that this be something that is -- that comes through the military, because the military, our armed forces, will be implementing it.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a welcome thing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I\'ll allow --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s the Commander-in-Chief, though.\xc2\xa0 Does he have to sign off on it, as opposed to just simply supporting it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is Commander-in-Chief.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, so does he just support it, or does he have to sign off on it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, why don\'t we wait for the announcement.\xc2\xa0 He is -- he\xe2\x80\x99s the boss.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, all the way in the back.\xc2\xa0 One more and then we\'ll go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 About -- because we saw yesterday, there could be some senators holding a press conference and saying they were sending a letter to the President pressing him to -- how to make his decision on the XL Keystone Pipeline faster.\xc2\xa0 How close are we to a decision on this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 We appreciate input from lawmakers, but as you know, as is in keeping with longstanding tradition, multi-administration tradition, these reviews are conducted by the State Department, and when the State Department concludes that process, we\'ll move forward, there will be a decision.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not going to get ahead of that process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the timeline will be --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he received this letter?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m aware of the letter.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I\'m sure we have it.\xc2\xa0 But again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- this is not an issue to be decided that way.\xc2\xa0 We\'re keeping with formal tradition here.\xc2\xa0 The State Department reviews it, and I refer you to them for the timeline.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks very much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t10:58 A.M.
