EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 I do not have any announcements to make at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDarlene, do you want to start?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 What response do you have for the House Benghazi Committee\xe2\x80\x99s report?\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure you have something.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I don\'t have much.\xc2\xa0 It seems at this point that, after eight different congressional inquiries have now been conducted into this matter, it seems that there\xe2\x80\x99s only one remaining question, and it\'s simply this:\xc2\xa0 Is the RNC going to disclose the in-kind contribution that they\xe2\x80\x99ve received from House Republicans today?\xc2\xa0 This is a $7-million effort funded by taxpayers to do what the would-be Speaker of the House says was their goal, which is to tear down Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s poll numbers.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that was their goal.\xc2\xa0 It remains to be seen if that\'s what they accomplish.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the specific claim that the military was slow to respond to these assaults -- eight hours after they had begun, no military assets had been directed towards the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this has been thoroughly debunked by previous Republican-led investigations in the Congress.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m not going to get into the back-and-forth because, frankly, Republicans have already done that.\xc2\xa0 Republicans in the House Intelligence Committee have concluded that those charges are not true.\xc2\xa0 Questions have been raised about that assertion by the Benghazi Committee\xe2\x80\x99s lead investigator.\xc2\xa0 So this is -- there is plenty of churn just to review what Republicans have concluded about this incident.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is those congressional committees that have been committed to trying to understand the facts of a tragedy that led to the death of four Americans have concluded that what happened was a tragedy.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99ve also concluded that the variety of conspiracy theories that have been flowering on the Republican side of the aisle are politically motivated fantasies.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s unfortunate that the death of four Americans would be subject to that kind of political fantasizing, but that is the state of the Republican Party these days.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 On another issue brewing up on the Hill, Democrats up there say that it\'s time to take another look at agency policies regarding displays of the Confederate flag at federal cemeteries.\xc2\xa0 Would President Obama agree to that?\xc2\xa0 And would he direct the Veterans Administration and also the National Park Service to remove any flags?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not aware of how this question has been raised administratively, so we can take a look at that.\xc2\xa0 I do know that House Republicans, in a partisan attempt to extend displays of the Confederate flag, did include that in the Zika bill that they passed in the dark of night last week.\xc2\xa0 I think that underscores the partisan nature of the legislation that they put forward.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not aware of any executive action that\'s being contemplated on this question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAyesha.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to talk about some more fallout from the Brexit vote.\xc2\xa0 Scotland is looking at ways of possibly staying with the EU -- stay in the EU or stay in the market\xc2\xa0 -- also possibly looking at independence from the UK in the wake of the vote.\xc2\xa0 Is that a concern for the White House, especially from a national security standpoint?\xc2\xa0 Scotland houses the UK nuclear program, so there are issues in that way, too, if there was to be a split within the UK.\xc2\xa0 So does the U.S. have any position on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a couple of things that we\'ve said before that I think are relevant to the question that you raised.\xc2\xa0 The first is that the United States values the critically important security relationship that we have with the United Kingdom.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the UK is a critically important partner in the NATO alliance.\xc2\xa0 That is the bedrock of our national security in this country.\xc2\xa0 So we obviously believe that that relationship is critically important and, frankly, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that that should at all be affected by the decision that British voters made last week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere was a referendum on Scottish independence a year or two ago.\xc2\xa0 We made clear at the time that, again, that was a decision for voters in Scotland to make.\xc2\xa0 But the United States\xe2\x80\x99 view has been and continues to be that a united UK is in the best interest of the United States.\xc2\xa0 It makes them a stronger partner. It makes them more effective in contributing to the NATO alliance that\'s the bedrock of our national security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And following up on that, has the President made any more calls to world leaders in the wake of that vote?\xc2\xa0 I know he made a call to Cameron and to Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Merkel, but has there been any more calls?\xc2\xa0 And also, the President made the trip to London earlier this year in support of the UK remaining in the EU.\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- now that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone that way, the markets are kind of flailing, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of uncertainty now.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel the need to maybe do more to try to calm the markets, do more to maybe push the U.S. -- what the U.S. would like to happen, to stable -- I guess to stable the move of the UK from the EU -- but is there more that the President needs to do to get the U.S. message out on this issue?\xc2\xa0 Because it is having such a large impact on the markets and on the global economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I\'m not going to talk about individual market movements.\xc2\xa0 Obviously senior administration officials had been in close touch with their counterparts in Europe and in the UK to discuss the consequences of the decision from the British people.\xc2\xa0 So we can get you a rundown of all of the conversations that Secretary Kerry has had with his counterparts.\xc2\xa0 He\'s even traveled in Europe and had conversations in person to discuss this matter.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOther senior officials here in the White House that also work closely with the President have been in touch with their counterparts, including the President\'s Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics, Wally Adeyemo, has been engaged with his G20 counterparts to discuss both this vote but also the consequences for increased volatility that we\'ve seen in the global financial markets.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is something that the Treasury Department continues to monitor closely.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President is monitoring it closely as well.\xc2\xa0 He\'s getting regularly briefed on it.\xc2\xa0 I would expect that the next opportunity that the President will have to discuss these issues with his counterparts will be at the NATO meeting in Poland -- it\'s coming up next week.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou\'ve heard us previously announce that the President intends to meet with the leaders of the EU in advance of his NATO Summit meeting, but I would anticipate that a lot of the conversations that he\'ll have with world leaders at that meeting, both formally and informally, will be to discuss the impact of this vote.\xc2\xa0 And obviously there has been some, as I mentioned, renewed volatility in the global financial markets, but the fact is, the special relationship between the United States and the UK will endure.\xc2\xa0 The close financial, economic, commercial and trade ties between the United States and the UK will remain.\xc2\xa0 That\'s good news because that\'s critically important to both our economies.\xc2\xa0 And I mentioned, of course, that the U.S.-UK defense relationship will remain strong.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe United States also has a number of very close partners who are part of the EU, and we\'re going to continue to closely coordinate with the EU on a variety of financial and national security measures.\xc2\xa0 And that cooperation and that collaboration continues unabated as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMichelle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 While we\'re still on that subject, just very quickly, would the President support a second referendum that\'s been floated as at least a possibility once a new prime minister comes in?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the British ambassador to the United States was pretty definitive about the finality of this decision.\xc2\xa0 But, ultimately, how all of this moves forward is up to the British people and their elected leaders.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President obviously had a strong opinion when the first referendum was coming around, so would he have just as strong an opinion on a second referendum if that does happen?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, the question about whether or not it\'s going to happen I think is something that British leaders and the British people will have to determine.\xc2\xa0 British leaders I think have made pretty clear their view that the decision that was made by the voters was final.\xc2\xa0 But, again, it will be up to them to render a judgment about the path forward here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur expectation, our hope is that the process, as it moves forward, will be orderly, will be as transparent as possible.\xc2\xa0 And we have been pleased to see a commitment to those principles, both by leaders in the UK but also leaders in the EU.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Benghazi report, you\'ve made your feelings abundantly clear what you think of it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not particularly surprising, I assume.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But now that it\'s over, the fact that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I thought it was over after the first five investigations.\xc2\xa0 This is the eighth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let\'s start with that, then.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that the breadth of this and the amount of time spent and, as you mentioned, the amount of money spent -- I mean, this was the broadest investigation we\'ve seen.\xc2\xa0 So at the very least does this, in your view, end things and sort of put a definitive stamp on it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\'s hard to say.\xc2\xa0 I think there were a lot of people who thought that after the first or second, or the third, or the fourth, or the fifth, or the sixth, or the seventh investigation, that that might be the end of it.\xc2\xa0 Republicans have clearly discerned a political motive.\xc2\xa0 And, to their credit, at least they were pretty blunt about it -- the would-be Speaker of the House indicated that the reason this committee was created was to drive down Secretary Clinton\'s poll numbers.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Richard Hanna from New York indicated that -- basically the same thing.\xc2\xa0 He said that the goal of this committee was to go after Secretary Clinton.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it\'s pretty clear what their motives are.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why, I guess, the only question that remains is whether or not this $7 million in-kind contribution will be correctly reported on next month\'s FEC campaign finance disclosure by the RNC.\xc2\xa0 Maybe we should have a congressional committee form to take a look at that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the goal on both sides was to -- or, okay, your goal, at least, was to put this to rest.\xc2\xa0 The fact that this investigation, unlike the others before it, did look at substantially more documentation that wasn\'t viewed by previous investigations -- don\'t you see some value in that?\xc2\xa0 That at least it might have answered questions in people\'s minds about the kind of information that was not viewed prior?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a select committee that spent more time looking at this matter than Congress spent looking at things like Pearl Harbor, the 9/11 attacks, the response to Hurricane Katrina, the Iran-Contra affair, the assassination of President Kennedy.\xc2\xa0 So it is clear that a lot of time and money and resources has been devoted to this effort.\xc2\xa0 But even Senator Rubio tweeted today that the committee found something that we already knew.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think even Republicans are struggling to articulate exactly what value has been derived from this -- other than what they acknowledge is their primary goal, which is to take more shots at Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 I think the unfortunate thing is that they had to spend $7 million in taxpayer money to do it.\xc2\xa0 And the unfortunate thing is that they are cynically trying to capitalize on the death of four innocent Americans who were serving their country overseas and were killed in this tragic accident.\xc2\xa0 And the degree to which Republicans are willing to play politics with their death and this tragedy is appalling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You view this as purely political.\xc2\xa0 How worried are you then about the political effects of this on Democrats?\xc2\xa0 And how do Democrats need to counter the message that comes out of this report?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I think individual Democrats will have to figure out for themselves.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton and her campaign have obviously issued their own statements.\xc2\xa0 You can talk to them about the strategy that they hope to pursue.\xc2\xa0 But, look, I think when it comes down to the political questions here, I think we should just sort of start by acknowledging what Leader McCarthy and Congressman Hanna have indicated, which is that this is a political exercise.\xc2\xa0 I think once we start from that conversation, then we can have an honest debate about what the political consequences of this particular decision should be.\xc2\xa0 And I think Secretary Clinton is more than capable of making her own case about her judgment, her successful tenure as Secretary of State, and what that says about her presidential campaign.\xc2\xa0 But, ultimately, that\'s the responsibility of her advisors.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you view this as damaging to Clinton in the eyes, potentially, of voters?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think voters will have to decide for themselves.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think Secretary Clinton and her team obviously have a strong case to make about her successful tenure as Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s a case I\'ll let them make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, to what extent is the British exit vote going to be discussed at the North American Summit tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 There seem to be some pretty serious security and economic considerations that even North American leaders will want to talk over.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, the Brexit vote has had an impact on global financial markets, including financial markets here in North America.\xc2\xa0 So I would anticipate it\'s something that the leaders will discuss.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t anticipate that it will be the focus of their conversations, but I\'m confident that it will come up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any lessons to be drawn about the willingness of one part of the trading bloc to want to go it alone in terms of North America,\xc2\xa0 NAFTA has proven tremendously controversial.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a big issue on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 Does the vote have any implications on that subject here in this continent as well?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it\'s always dangerous to oversimplify these kinds of questions that voters are considering, but there\'s something unique about the efforts to integrate Europe that I think makes it quite a bit different than just a trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the trade ties and our relationship with both Mexico and Canada are strong, and our economies are well-integrated.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the security of all of our countries is enhanced by maintaining strong and high-functioning relationship with our neighbors.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat Europe was trying -- was attempting to do was materially different in terms of trying to establish a common currency.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the UK wasn\'t a part of that, but it\'s an indication of the ambition that they had for integrating the continent and binding their countries together.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe countries in North America have pursued a different strategy, and one that has worked well for us.\xc2\xa0 It is a strategy that has enhanced the economies of all of our countries.\xc2\xa0 It\'s enhanced the national security of all of our countries, and it certainly has made North America the most successful continent in the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the goal of the leaders in their discussions tomorrow will be to further intensify our efforts to cooperate, even as we see some added volatility in the global financial markets and even as we face down some other threats to our own security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more question on trade.\xc2\xa0 You said in the wake of the Brexit vote that you still want to press ahead with a trade agreement with Europe.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not going to happen on the President\xe2\x80\x99s watch, is it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the goal that we have set, Mark, is to try to complete those negotiations by the end of this year.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a continent that now is in turmoil.\xc2\xa0 How can you possibly complete an agreement with a Europe that is so distracted by this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that certainly is one argument.\xc2\xa0 I think the other argument you could make is that given the new challenges that the EU is facing, they would place an even higher priority in strengthening their ties economically to the United States.\xc2\xa0 So there is no denying that even if the UK had voted to remain in the EU, that completing a T-TIP by the end of this year would be an ambitious goal.\xc2\xa0 I think it continues to be an ambitious goal, but one that we believe is possible by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to see where things go from here.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tToluse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Following up on Brexit and trade, Speaker Paul Ryan said in a couple of interviews that the U.S. should start immediately sort of negotiating a new trade agreement with the UK.\xc2\xa0 Is he wrong to say that that is a good strategy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important, first, to recognize is that there already is an important financial and economic relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom.\xc2\xa0 Those ties are valuable.\xc2\xa0 Those ties have a positive impact on both of our countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat the President said when he was in London earlier this year continues to be true, however, which is that if the United States were to begin bilateral trade talks with the UK, those talks would be starting a different place because we\'ve already made years of progress through negotiations with the broader EU. And the President discussed in some detail the value and the efficiency gains of the United States negotiating with a whole block of countries, as opposed to just one country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, the one country that we\'re talking about is the United Kingdom, a country with whom we have a special relationship, a country with whom we already have critically important economic ties.\xc2\xa0 But the fact remains that we\'ve already made lots of progress in negotiating a trade agreement with a bloc of countries.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s just where things stand right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think in terms of sort of what additional steps could be taken to enhance the economic relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is something that policymakers in both countries will have to consider in years ahead -- and presumably that picture for that path forward will be clearer -- once it\xe2\x80\x99s clearer exactly how the UK will pursue the process of extricating itself from the EU.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President also sort of made a statement that it could be years before -- sort of several years down the line, and that Britain would be at \xe2\x80\x9cthe back of the queue\xe2\x80\x9d when it comes to trade.\xc2\xa0 It seems like you\'re saying that the U.S. and the UK could not even start something while other negotiations are going on on a parallel track.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to say.\xc2\xa0 We\'re four or five days out of this decision being made by the British voters, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t handicap a date about when those kinds of conversations would occur.\xc2\xa0 I think what is true is that the UK would not benefit from the years of progress we have made in negotiating a trade agreement with the EU.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe UK does benefit from the special relationship they have with the United States.\xc2\xa0 They benefit from the important economic relationship what already exists between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 But they start -- if and when those negotiations were to start, they would start in a different place because of the progress that we\'ve already made in trying to complete an agreement with the EU.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJerome.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering how does the President feel about the role he played in the Brexit debate?\xc2\xa0 Does he believe he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone so far, given the end result?\xc2\xa0 Or to the contrary, does he believe he did too little, too late, and as some argue, he didn\'t pay enough attention to Europe during his presidency?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, let me try to unpack this.\xc2\xa0 I think what I would start with is that the President traveled to London at the invitation of Prime Minister Cameron.\xc2\xa0 And while in London, they had conversations on a range of issues that are critically important to our two countries -- issues both related to national security and the economy.\xc2\xa0 And while he was there, the President did make an unequivocal statement about the U.S. view of the question facing British voters, and the President I think gave a rather lengthy but direct analysis of how the United States would be impacted by the decision made by the British people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd this was an important analysis for the President to offer for a couple of reasons.\xc2\xa0 The first is, given the special relationship between our two countries, it seemed appropriate for the British people to factor in the impact of this vote on their relationship with the United States.\xc2\xa0 It also was an important statement for the President to make because many proponents of Brexit were ascribing to the United States some views of the matter that, frankly, didn\'t reflect the views of the leader of the United States.\xc2\xa0 So the President had an opportunity to set the record straight.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat eventual impact that had on the outcome I think is something that I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave to the analysts to decide.\xc2\xa0 I think what is clear is that in the days after those comments from the President in London, there was what I would describe as positive movement in the polls, but things didn\'t end up where we would have liked.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, again, the President, all along, from before the trip to during the trip, to after the trip, made clear that this was a decision for the British people to make based on their own analysis of their country\xe2\x80\x99s interests.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what they did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to our broader relationship with Europe, I think it is hard for the President\xe2\x80\x99s harshest critics to suggest that somehow he has given short shrift to our relationship with our European allies when some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent critics have suggested that, for example, the United States should leave NATO.\xc2\xa0 I think that would be undermining our important relationship with our allies in Europe in a way that would have devastating consequences for our national security.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s record of strengthening those relationships is well documented.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Benghazi, after all these investigations and so forth, what is the simple answer to the question of why there was no rescue?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that there was a -- there have been committee hearings that have looked at this --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I honestly don\'t know the answer to the question.\xc2\xa0 And I think a lot of people at home who are trying to sort this out and it\'s out there, and they hear all the back-and-forth between -- it\'s a simple question.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t that happen?\xc2\xa0 Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there -- why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the U.S. military able to rescue these --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think where we should start, Ron, is we should start talking about what the Department of Defense did do.\xc2\xa0 And they did, as Secretary Panetta has acknowledged, react to the President\xe2\x80\x99s orders to make sure that all available DOD assets in the region were available and could be used to respond to the attack in Libya and protect U.S. interests and personnel in the region.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat that meant is that the U.S. military did succeed in executing the safe evacuation of all U.S. government personnel from Benghazi 12 hours after the initial attack.\xc2\xa0 And they moved a number of personnel to the Ramstein Air Force Base and took steps to protect U.S. personnel.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that is consistent with the conclusions of the Accountability Review Board that basically found that the result was exceptional U.S. government coordination military response and saved the lives of two severely wounded Americans.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said -- the DOD statement emphasized that they were involved in stabilizing the evacuation of Tripoli, the embassy in Tripoli.\xc2\xa0 You\'re focusing on the military role there --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My point is they did both.\xc2\xa0 There were a number of personnel in Benghazi that were safely extracted by DOD assets hours after the attack.\xc2\xa0 There were some U.S. citizens who were killed.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the reason we\'re having this conversation.\xc2\xa0 But, yes, this was a successful DOD operation to respond to the President\xe2\x80\x99s orders to save as many Americans as possible.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt is tragic that four Americans died.\xc2\xa0 But according to the Accountability Review Board that was chaired by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, and Thomas Pickering, a U.S. diplomat that served both Presidents, they took a close look at this and had praise for the military response.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And while a lot has been said about whether this was an attack on Secretary Clinton, there were some allegations or charges at the White House, specifically -- not the Secretary.\xc2\xa0 And some focused on this 7:30 meeting that was chaired by Denis McDonough.\xc2\xa0 Again, I realize you don\'t want to litigate point by point, but in the interest of clarity, what was accomplished at that time?\xc2\xa0 And I know you\'re going to debunk the allegation that somehow there was an order to stand down or something --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s not just me that\'s going to debunk it.\xc2\xa0 The lead investigator of the committee is going to debunk that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I get that.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t want to -- that\'s not the issue.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The issue is, what happened in that meeting?\xc2\xa0 What evidence is there that that moved the operation forward?\xc2\xa0 The other charge that this was all about the video and not about what was really going on on the ground.\xc2\xa0 I know, I hear you.\xc2\xa0 But tell me whatever you can -- just to clear the air once and for all about what happened when in that session.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any air to clear, Ron.\xc2\xa0 I think the fact is that the White House and the National Security Council that functions here at the White House fulfilled its responsibility to make sure that the number of government agencies that were involved in this effort were assembled to discuss an ongoing emergency.\xc2\xa0 And there were steps that were taken to safeguard diplomats in other places around the globe, and a variety of other steps were taken.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what you would expect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think this is the best evidence yet that this is a Republican conspiracy seeking political advantage out of the terrible tragedy.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s just no \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x9d there.\xc2\xa0 There hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been.\xc2\xa0 But yet we have seen repeated attempts by Republicans to try to score political points off the deaths of four innocent Americans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x9d there was, in fact, once this happened, after this happened, there had to be some changes made.\xc2\xa0 Correct? There had to be some changes made in terms of how the military could respond to something like this.\xc2\xa0 So clearly, the military wasn\xe2\x80\x99t organized in the way effectively to do this.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure the White House reassessed how it might have better responded to this sort of situation -- correct?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ron, again, years ago -- years ago, the Accountability Review Board -- this is a body that was chaired by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a renowned U.S. diplomat who served under both Presidents -- examined this situation.\xc2\xa0 They put forward 29 different recommendations for reforms that should be implemented by the State Department.\xc2\xa0 The State Department has implemented or is in the process of implementing every single one of those things.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, that is a set of conclusions that were reached more than three years ago, now.\xc2\xa0 I think the real question is, again, why are we considering the eighth congressional investigation into this matter?\xc2\xa0 If the Accountability Review Board that was led by men with impeccable, bipartisan national security credentials has reviewed this matter, suggested that there are 29 different reforms that could be implemented, those reforms are implemented, what possible goal could Republicans have by taking a look at this matter in 2016 other than trying to influence the outcome of the elections that are held in 2016?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jordan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you a question about Zika. The Surgeon General said earlier this month that we\'re coming to the point where the funding of the Zika response is going to run out.\xc2\xa0 Now that Congress -- the Senate failed to advance this latest funding package, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a deal at least before July 4th, can you say exactly when the money for the Zika response is going to run out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jordan, I think the issue that we have is that there\xe2\x80\x99s insufficient funding that\'s being dedicated to the effort to fight Zika and to protect pregnant women and their children in this country.\xc2\xa0 That is the issue.\xc2\xa0 And what the Department of Health and Human Services has already done is taken funding that has been deployed for a range of public health questions, challenges, and devoted it specifically to this effort.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut even that is not enough.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve made clear that that\'s not enough.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President put forward a package four months ago -- this is a package that was recommended to him by the foremost public health officials in the country.\xc2\xa0 And for the last four months, we have seen Republicans do very little other than play political games with that request.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo you would think that at some point the safety and well-being of pregnant women in the United States would be more important than politics to Republicans.\xc2\xa0 But unfortunately, it\'s not.\xc2\xa0 Because as I mentioned to Darlene earlier, Republicans now apparently see the Zika funding as the vehicle to allow the display of Confederate flags in cemeteries across the country.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t really understand what that has to do with the Zika virus and protecting pregnant women, but that\'s the vehicle that Republicans have apparently chosen to use in order to ram through a partisan measure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\'s apparent that Republicans don\'t take this particularly seriously, but I can tell you that public health professionals across the country take this seriously.\xc2\xa0 In fact, just today we have a letter from a couple dozen nonprofits urging Congress to dispense with the kind of partisanship that House Republicans have displayed and to act on what they describe as a public health emergency.\xc2\xa0 These are organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Easter Seals, the March of Dimes.\xc2\xa0 These are organizations that don\'t have any interest in partisan politics; they do have a keen interest in protecting the American people and protecting pregnant women, and preventing birth defects.\xc2\xa0 And what they\xe2\x80\x99re urging Republicans to do is to dispense with the partisanship and actually focus on this public health emergency. We\'ll see if Republicans are persuaded.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess in the absence, though, of that funding for now, can you tell us when is the next time that public health agencies are going to have to move around money to fund the Zika response through the summer --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jordan, I think the point is that right now they don\'t have as much money as they would like to have in order to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 If you\'re asking me when are those agencies going to need more money to fight the Zika virus, they need that money right now.\xc2\xa0 They needed that money four months ago.\xc2\xa0 They needed to send -- for a variety of reasons.\xc2\xa0 They needed to send a clear message to the private sector that we were going to be invested in their efforts to develop a vaccine and to develop enhanced diagnostics, and to expand lab capacity so that people would get tested quickly, get their results and know what precautions they should take to protect their partner or other people in their community from the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFor weeks, if not months, we\'ve seen local officials, particularly in the South, ask for additional assistance from the federal government so they could do a better job of fighting mosquito populations in their states.\xc2\xa0 That request, even from those Republican officials, has fallen on deaf ears.\xc2\xa0 Governor Rick Scott from Florida -- no friend of the Obama administration -- is making the same case that the Obama administration is, that Congress needs to step up to the plate and provide additional resources that can be used to try to fight the mosquitoes that are carrying the Zika virus.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\'s only Republicans in Congress who are treating this as a partisan issue.\xc2\xa0 Governors in both parties all across the country have called on Congress to act on this.\xc2\xa0 Public health professionals, including charitable organizations, like the Easter Seals and the March of Dimes, are calling on Republicans in the Congress to act.\xc2\xa0 But the only thing we\'ve seen Republicans in Congress do thus far is to try to make this issue partisan, for reasons that are difficult to explain.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on another subject.\xc2\xa0 July 4th is next week.\xc2\xa0 Federal lawmakers come back to town after that.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House -- what kind of conversations have White House officials been in with the lawmakers, particularly those who staged the sit-in when it came to guns last week?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to seeing common-sense gun safety legislation pass continues to be a priority.\xc2\xa0 There have been ongoing conversations between some members of the Senate and the Justice Department to put together a bipartisan, common-sense amendment that would effectively prevent individuals who are suspected of having ties with terrorism from being able to walk into a store and buy a gun.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we\'ve seen very little appetite from Republicans in Congress and most Republicans in the Senate to moving forward on that common-sense bill.\xc2\xa0 In fact, they don\'t want to move forward -- Leader McConnell said over the weekend that he believes that we should just move on.\xc2\xa0 That is a dereliction of duty.\xc2\xa0 That is a failure of their fundamental responsibility to take common-sense steps to protect the country.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, voters are going to have to decide whether and how to hold their elected representatives in Congress responsible for that dereliction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So last week, the spotlight was on the sit-in and the effort and the bill.\xc2\xa0 Next week there are calls to possibly do it again if there\xe2\x80\x99s not movement.\xc2\xa0 President Obama, the First Lady, Valerie Jarrett and many from the White House supported publicly on Twitter and all social media the efforts of the sit-in.\xc2\xa0 Are you in support of another sit-in if there were some type of action like that, that would maybe last even longer to bring more attention to possibly get this measure passed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the White House is strongly in support of is congressional action.\xc2\xa0 And House Democrats are going to see -- are going to need to figure out what they can do to try to prompt that action.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the White House is going to stand with them as they undertake those efforts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we\'ve seen far too much congressional dysfunction under Republican congressional leadership.\xc2\xa0 And whether that is failing to pass -- to approve the needed resources to fight Zika, or to pass common-sense gun safety legislation, or to play politics with the terrible tragedy in Libya, I think the record of Republicans in Congress is one that is checkered with partisanship and not filled with a lot of results.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOlivier.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Why is it so hard to reschedule the joint campaign event with Hillary Clinton?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you won\'t be surprised to hear that both President Obama and Secretary Clinton have rather busy schedules. But hopefully we\'ll have some news on that rescheduled event quite soon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s on the trail -- that\'s her busy schedule.\xc2\xa0 And he surely anticipated that he would be out campaigning for Democrats.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\'s not -- it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a surprise that we\'re in an election year, so why -- do you guys have requirements for this? Does it have to be a particular state?\xc2\xa0 Does it have to be on a particular day?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t understand why this isn\'t coming together.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not sure it\'s quite that complicated.\xc2\xa0 I think -- you have to talk the Secretary Clinton and her team about exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s on their schedule.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we can\'t do it tomorrow because the President is meeting with the leaders of Canada and Mexico.\xc2\xa0 The President had the Global Entrepreneurship Summit on the West Coast last week.\xc2\xa0 So there are constraints given their schedule.\xc2\xa0 But I would anticipate that we\'ll have some news on this relatively soon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post had a really captivating story about the apparent campaign of harassment of American diplomats by Russia.\xc2\xa0 Has this ever been brought to the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention?\xc2\xa0 Has he discussed it?\xc2\xa0 His former ambassador Michael McFaul apparently was one of the targets.\xc2\xa0 Has this ever risen to his attention?\xc2\xa0 And if so, has he ever brought it up with Vladimir Putin?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any additional details of conversations to relay.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the United States continues to be concerned about U.S. diplomats who are being harassed at not just the embassy in Moscow, but in other diplomatic facilities around the world.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve raised those concerns with senior Russian officials and reminded them of their responsibility, particularly when it pertains to diplomats in Russia, of their responsibility to protect those diplomats, not to harass them.\xc2\xa0 But I can\'t speak to any specific presidential involvement other than to confirm for you that he certainly is aware of it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tByron.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 When David Plouffe was at the White House, was it common for him to be involved in preparing employees with a national security portfolio for TV appearances?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Byron, it was common for senior communications officials in the White House to be involved in preparing senior administration officials for television appearances.\xc2\xa0 That was true in the first term.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been true in the second term, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In her interview, Susan Rice seemed to imply that that was unusual.\xc2\xa0 David Plouffe\xe2\x80\x99s presence in helping her prepare for that Sunday talk show had nothing to do with the fact there was a hard-fought presidential campaign underway?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think the fact that a senior communication official at the White House was involved in a call to ensure that a senior administration official was prepared for a television appearance shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be particularly surprising to someone like you, who has closely covered the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you understand, at least, why there is some controversy about what the administration was telling the public at the time?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I can\'t.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your predecessor --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your predecessor stood up there three days after the attack and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no information that suggests Benghazi was preplanned attack,\xe2\x80\x9d when three days earlier your Secretary of State had emailed her daughter that it clearly seemed to be a terrorist attack.\xc2\xa0 And then a few days later, you have State Department employees emailing each other that Susan Rice was \xe2\x80\x9coff the reservation.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 In hindsight, were the things the administration was saying in the days after the attack incorrect? Should you have been more judicious?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Byron, I think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave it to the Republicans on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, who in their report that was issued almost two years ago -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll just quote from them to make this process a little easier.\xc2\xa0 They said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe process used to develop the talking points was flawed, but that the talking points reflected the conflicting intelligence assessments in the days immediately following the crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 They continued, \xe2\x80\x9cThere was absolutely no evidence in documents or testimony that the intelligence community\xe2\x80\x99s assessments were politically motivated in any way.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s not my statement.\xc2\xa0 That is the statement of House Republicans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\'t understand why the current crop of House Republicans who are looking at this matter didn\'t pay any attention to the previous assessment of House Republicans.\xc2\xa0 The previous assessment was from House Republicans who serve on the Intelligence Committee in the House.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you draw your own conclusions on why a politically motivated Benghazi committee may have reached a different conclusion than Republicans who serve on the House Intelligence Committee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But by saying there\xe2\x80\x99s no information suggesting Benghazi was a preplanned attack, that\'s different than saying there\xe2\x80\x99s conflicting -- if he had come out and said, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of conflicting information about this, that\'s one thing.\xc2\xa0 But you chose the interpretation that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of most favorable politically to the White House.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 House Republicans say there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence in documents or testimony that the intelligence community\xe2\x80\x99s assessments were politically motivated in any way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo again, I think it is really hard to argue with the conclusion of House Republicans who serve on the intelligence committee who concluded that there is no evidence of any political motivation or interference.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Being politically motivated, though, is different from whether the White House was sloppy in providing information after -- in the days after the attack.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And again, there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence of that.\xc2\xa0 The process used to develop talking points was flawed.\xc2\xa0 But the talking points reflected the conflicting intelligence assessments in the days immediately following the crisis.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not my defense.\xc2\xa0 That is actually the conclusion of House Republicans who serve on the Intelligence Committee in the House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a question on North America?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure, go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, during the press call with the White House official on the meeting, the bilateral that President Obama is going to have with the President of Mexico tomorrow, information, trade, energy, and other issues, but it was an absence of human rights in Mexico.\xc2\xa0 That\'s always been a very important topic for the U.S. to discuss with Mexico.\xc2\xa0 And the last few weeks has been a very high crisis with human rights in Mexico.\xc2\xa0 Is President Obama going to ask the President of Mexico about the situation of human rights?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, the President is looking forward to the opportunity that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to sit down with President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Mexico, obviously, is a country with whom the United States has a critically important relationship.\xc2\xa0 That relationship has an impact on a variety of aspects of American life.\xc2\xa0 That includes our economy.\xc2\xa0 That also includes our culture.\xc2\xa0 And the President is looking forward to the opportunity to have that meeting.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\'t have much of a preview to share at this point, other than to tell you that you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to hear from the two leaders tomorrow -- both at the beginning of their bilateral meeting, but also in a trilateral news conference that all three leaders will be convening together.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously, human rights is something that the President raises in his conversations with leaders of countries around the world.\xc2\xa0 And human rights is a priority for this President, and advancing the cause of human rights around the world is a priority for this President.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have more of a preview of that meeting to share at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was also mentioned that President Obama is going to ask the government of Mexico to reduce the production of heroin. And today the DEA released the new heroin threat assessment, saying that the number of Americans who die of an overdose of heroin tripled in the last four years.\xc2\xa0 My question is, since to the Mexicans, that it\xe2\x80\x99s also the failure of the U.S. government to attack the problem of consumption and the amount of heroin, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just Mexico to blame of production of heroin.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also the consumption and the demand of the drug in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to that question of the Mexicans?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I would respond to it in a couple of ways.\xc2\xa0 The first is, the United States is obviously taking quite seriously our efforts to combat the drug trade.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been able to work effectively with the Mexican government to fight the flow of drugs coming over the border from Mexico.\xc2\xa0 But we obviously believe that there is more that Mexico can and should do to assist in that effort.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe also believe that there is more that the United States can and should do to treat heroin addiction in this country as more than just a law enforcement problem.\xc2\xa0 And the President has put forward a very specific set of ideas about how to expand access to health care so that people who are addicted to opioids and heroin can get treatment.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, unfortunately, we have not seen additional resources committed by Republicans in Congress, despite repeated requests to do so.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, the President put forward in his budget proposal a very specific, funded, paid-for plan to expand access to drug treatment programs in this country.\xc2\xa0 And as you will recall, House Republicans and Senate Republicans, for the first time in 40 years, *[didn\xe2\x80\x99t] agree to even have a hearing on the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just that Republicans have blocked that funding, they won\xe2\x80\x99t even talk about it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\'s unfortunate because we know that the heroin and opioids addiction problems in this country are significant and are having an impact on not just lives, but communities across the country.\xc2\xa0 And there certainly is more that we can do expand access to health care, to expand access to treatment programs, and reduce the demand for heroin in the United States.\xc2\xa0 That would absolutely have a positive impact on our law enforcement efforts.\xc2\xa0 It also would have a positive impact on the lives of the people who are -- have been so deeply affected in a negative way by this kind of addiction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMargaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I do have a question about the summit tomorrow, but first I want to ask about Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 There does seem to be at least one thing that both the Democrats and Republicans agree on when it comes to this probe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That it\xe2\x80\x99s politically motivated.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the Democrats in their probe, as well, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about, and the report they released yesterday --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- pointing out that security was \xe2\x80\x9cwoefully inadequate\xe2\x80\x9d in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 That was the language used by Democrats.\xc2\xa0 They also pointed to intelligence failures in the Republican report.\xc2\xa0 So my question is whether the White House is satisfied that those failures have been adequately addressed by the State Department and other agencies.\xc2\xa0 I mean, are American diplomats abroad any safer now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think what I would go back to is the Accountability Review Board.\xc2\xa0 This was an independent group of professionals, of experts, that was created by Secretary Clinton, was chaired by Admiral Mullen --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congressionally mandated, though -- they\'re required to.\xc2\xa0 But I take your point, people were on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But they\'re basically our experts who took an independent look at the situation.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals like Admiral Mike Mullen, Ambassador Thomas Pickering, a diplomat who served under both Presidents, and they took a careful look at this.\xc2\xa0 They put forward 29 specific recommendations that should be implemented by the State Department to improve security at facilities around the globe and to address other concerns that were raised by this particular incident.\xc2\xa0 The State Department has implemented all of them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, again, this is something that happened years ago.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why it\'s hard to take very seriously the charges that are being leveled by Republicans in Congress.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 State said they implemented 26 of the 29 recommendations.\xc2\xa0 But that aside, I mean, bigger picture, is the White House satisfied?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Twenty-six have been completed, the other three are in the process of being implemented.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are American diplomats abroad safer now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, absolutely, because these recommendations have been or are being implemented by the State Department.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to the intelligence failures, you think those have also been adequately addressed in terms of those laid out by Secretary Panetta and other agency leaders?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I have full confidence that the kinds of reforms that we would like to see after an incident like this have been implemented in a way that has enhanced our national security, that has enhanced the safety of diplomats around the globe.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the kind of response that you would expect if there was a genuine interest in trying to address the tragedy to make the country safer -- to learn lessons and make sure that something like that didn\'t happen again, or at least take as many steps as possible to prevent something like that from happening again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf you\'re interested in politics, what you do is you spend basically the three or four years after the incident basically trying to drum up conspiracy theories that never really pan out, and releasing high-profile reports that even Republicans themselves acknowledged are motivated at attacking a prominent Democratic politician.\xc2\xa0 That\'s unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly is a disrespectful way to recognize and memorialize the death of four innocent Americans who were serving their country overseas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last on Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 Your feelings are very clear, but bigger picture, do you think there is any public interest that was served to have gone through what was supposed to be this select committee bipartisan probe?\xc2\xa0 I mean, some would argue that this was how evidence was revealed in regard to Secretary Clinton using a private email server for government business\xc2\xa0 -- it all sort of -- the scandals melded together there in some way.\xc2\xa0 But some would say, hey, at least that was something that perhaps is in the public interest, given that there\'s still an FBI investigation underway in regard to that particular point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think what I would simply have to say about this is that it is clear that Republicans had to work really hard to make the eighth installment of this series interesting.\xc2\xa0 I think Hollywood producers would be happy to tell you how difficult it is to sell sequels.\xc2\xa0 And by the time you\'re around to the eighth one, you have to find ways to add high-speed car chases and more explosions, but that doesn\'t make them any more useful to the public.\xc2\xa0 It may make them more entertaining to the audience that you\'re trying to appeal to, and we know there\'s a very clear partisan audience that Republicans are trying to appeal to, but I think it\'s pretty hard for any Republican or a Democrat, for that matter, to make the case that useful, additional information has been yielded in the context of the Benghazi committee\'s years\' long probe of this particular situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the summit tomorrow, Canada today lifted visa requirements on Mexicans traveling there, making it easier for Mexicans to visit Canada.\xc2\xa0 Is President Obama looking at a similar or any kind of sort of confidence-building gesture, given the talk right now about building walls, rather than making it easier for Mexicans to come to the United States?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements to make in terms of our immigration policies.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the ability of the United States and Mexico to do business, to give Americans and Mexicans the opportunity to visit our respective countries for tourism or for other purposes is something that makes a substantial and positive contribution to our economy and economic growth.\xc2\xa0 So maintaining those ties is important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what the President has also said is that securing the border is important, and that\'s why, under President Obama\'s leadership, we have made an historic investment in resources and personnel to secure the border between the United States and Mexico.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly want to do that in a way that doesn\'t unnecessarily inhibit lawful travel between our two countries because we know that kind of travel and those kinds of exchanges have positive economic benefits for both countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Mexican President has obviously watched television. -- made public comments in his own country, expressing a lot of concern about some of the rhetoric being used by Donald Trump.\xc2\xa0 Will President Obama directly address some of that in his conversation with the Mexican President tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is he in any way, broadly speaking, trying to strengthen the relationship with Mexico ahead of this election?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has spoken before about how world leaders have certainly made note of the debate on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that the impact of that debate has not been entirely positive when it comes to the international perception of the United States.\xc2\xa0 But the President, as he has done many times publicly, has privately assured other world leaders of the wisdom of the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Donald Trump, in short, will come up in terms of trying to reassure him?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that\'s not on the President\'s agenda tomorrow, but --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But immigration, refugees, all of those issues are on the table.\xc2\xa0 The Mexican President has compared Trump to Mussolini and Hitler.\xc2\xa0 I mean, his views are pretty clear.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s why I\'m not denying that it\'s going to come up.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying that the President\'s agenda will be different.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll see.\xc2\xa0 You\'ll have an opportunity to hear from the leaders tomorrow, and they can tell you whether or not they discussed it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKaren.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back to Zika.\xc2\xa0 You say that there already isn\'t enough funding there for public health officials and public health agencies.\xc2\xa0 All indications are now that nothing will get done, as you just went through to the earlier question, but is there a backup plan right now to find funds somewhere else as there was done the Ebola funding -- take money from somewhere and apply it to this, given how urgent you keep saying this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, our backup plan has already been deployed.\xc2\xa0 And you\'ll recall that it was four months ago that the administration put forward a very specific legislative proposal, written by public health experts, detailing for Congress exactly what was necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 And Congress hasn\'t acted. Democrats have been eager to act on that proposal, but Republicans have blocked it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRepublicans have turned yet another critical matter into a partisan tool, and that\'s unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 But, look, I don\'t have any additional information about other potential steps that could be used to find additional funding for this.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why Congress needs to act.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why this is Congress\'s responsibility to ensure that the necessary resources are provided to develop vaccines, to develop diagnostics, to expand lab capacity, to educate the public about steps they can take to protect themselves.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are certainly additional resources that can be deployed to fight mosquito populations in local communities across the country.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got state and local officials who are practically begging for additional resources to do a better job of fighting the mosquito population.\xc2\xa0 But those calls from Democratic and Republican officials alike are falling on deaf ears when it comes to Republicans in Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ve been ringing the alarms now for weeks, if not months, when the initial request for funding went out.\xc2\xa0 But is there more that the White House could be doing?\xc2\xa0 Could the President be doing more hands-on talking to members of Congress on this?\xc2\xa0 Is the Vice President making calls up on the Hill and pushing for this?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you keep saying how urgent it is, but besides us asking questions and you talking about it, what else is being done that we don\'t know about?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess the question I would have is, why should the President be in the position of twisting Republican arms in Congress to do something that our public health professionals say is necessary to address a public health emergency?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President has had a number of conversations, and I\'m confident that he will moving forward, but it\'s pretty obvious what\'s happening here.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans are refusing to embrace their basic responsibility to ensure that our public health professionals have the funding that they need to do everything possible to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t know why Republicans won\'t act.\xc2\xa0 But they\'ll have to explain that to their constituents I suppose.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRich.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, in the first part of the Republican comment that you read in response to Byron\'s question, you cited the Republicans said the talking-point development was flawed.\xc2\xa0 Was it?\xc2\xa0 Do you sign on to that part of their statement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\'s a -- it has long been acknowledged that there were conflicting assessments from the intelligence community in the days after this particular incident.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s something that the intelligence community has testified to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The posture, the answer from the administration wasn\'t necessarily conflicting -- it was largely focused on this video. That didn\'t come across publicly, at least in what we had heard in the interviews following the event on September 11th.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But I think the difference here, Rich, is that Republicans have suggested that there is a political motive.\xc2\xa0 Republicans in the context of this committee have suggested that there is a political motive when writing the talking points.\xc2\xa0 But House Republicans who serve on the intelligence community -- on the Intelligence Committee in the House say that there was no evidence to substantiate that claim.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So taking your point that it\'s not -- that you say that it\'s not political, was it flawed, though?\xc2\xa0 Was the process flawed and were the points flawed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the Intelligence Committee -- the intelligence community, even in testifying here, has acknowledged that there was conflicting intelligence information that they were sifting through in the immediate aftermath of the attack.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\xe2\x80\x99s new.\xc2\xa0 I also think given the chaotic situation that was unfolding, I don\'t think it\'s particularly surprising to hear that that might have been the case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in discussing the briefing and you talking about it with Byron, Republicans point out who wasn\'t in the briefing.\xc2\xa0 They say the administration did not have DOD, FBI, CIA -- not on that private call with Ben Rhodes and David Plouffe the night before the Sunday show appearances.\xc2\xa0 Would it be -- why not?\xc2\xa0 And how and when did Ambassador Rice get an intelligence assessment before appearing to essentially be the face of the description for what had happened from the administration\'s point of view?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Rich, I think what is pretty clear is -- and, again, this is something that is backed up by conclusions reached by Republicans in one of the seven previous investigations that they have done -- is that there was no political effort to manipulate the information that was presented.\xc2\xa0 There is no evidence to substantiate that claim.\xc2\xa0 I recognize it has not prevented Republicans from continuing to make that claim, but they do so without any shred of evidence.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And discussing the politicization of it in your remarks at the top of the briefing, you talked about the RNC reimbursing taxpayers.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Just disclosing the in-kind contribution I think would be enough.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the Democrats\' version of the report, they mentioned the presumptive Republican nominee 23 times.\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that political?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think you\'d have to ask the House Democrats about their report.\xc2\xa0 I think what is clear is that the would-be Speaker of the House acknowledged that the reason that this committee was formed was to drive down Secretary Clinton\'s poll numbers.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Richard Hanna from upstate New York indicated that the whole purpose of this committee was to go after Secretary Clinton.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, again, you\'re certainly welcome to quote me in talking about the political motivations of the Republicans in Congress when looking at this issue.\xc2\xa0 But if you\'re skeptical and you think that I have a partisan bias, then I would encourage you to look at leading Republicans who serve in the House of Representatives, who say that the activities of their fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives are politically motivated and merely an attempt to drive down Secretary Clinton\'s poll numbers.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the administration regret any decisions made up to, during, or after?\xc2\xa0 Anything it thinks it could have done differently?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Rich, the fact that the Accountability Review Board found 25 -- or 29 reforms that needed to be implemented I think is an indication that, yes, there are some reforms that were necessary.\xc2\xa0 And the President certainly has prioritized the safety and security of Americans who are serving our country around the globe, whether that is in uniform or in our diplomatic corps.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the administration is taking quite seriously the need to implement these reforms, and as Margaret pointed out, almost all of them have been implemented and the three that haven\'t been yet are in the process of being implemented.\xc2\xa0 So I think that is a pretty clear indication that this administration has set aside politics and actually focused on what can make the country and our diplomats safer.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve taken concrete steps to follow that advice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 That is advice that we received almost three years ago, and that is advice that we are implementing to protect the safety and well-being of the American people and American diplomats.\xc2\xa0 Republicans, three years later, are still trying to play politics.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s rather unfortunate, to say the least.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLauren.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Zika.\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t $1 billion better than nothing?\xc2\xa0 You keep saying that this is political, that the Republicans are making this a political issue.\xc2\xa0 But Speaker Ryan is the one who said there needs to be checks and balances on this money.\xc2\xa0 So why don\'t we give X amount of money and then another piece of money?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard him say exactly that.\xc2\xa0 I think the first question I would ask for Speaker Ryan is, if our public health professionals say they need $1.9 billion to do everything possible to protect pregnant women and their newborn babies, then why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we just use those resources to do exactly that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think that is a very difficult question for Speaker Ryan and other House Republicans to answer.\xc2\xa0 They would rather, Lauren, because there is nothing that apparently escapes their partisan motivations, they\xe2\x80\x99d rather play politics.\xc2\xa0 So what Republicans have done is basically found what they apparently think is a convenient vehicle for ramming through controversial policy that relates to Confederate flags.\xc2\xa0 What does that have to do with the Zika virus?\xc2\xa0 Nothing.\xc2\xa0 Other than it presents an opportunity for Republicans to ram through the Congress something controversial.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the other thing that\'s included in here is that there are certain prohibitions on using these resources for contraception efforts.\xc2\xa0 This is a sexually transmitted disease.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s an indication that Republicans don\'t take this particularly seriously.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are also measures in here that would suspend some rules and regulations that apply for the Clean Water Act.\xc2\xa0 What does that have to do with fighting Zika?\xc2\xa0 Why do we need to suspend environmental regulations for six months in order to more effectively fight mosquito populations?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, I think these are questions that are hard for Republicans to answer.\xc2\xa0 The only explanation is they\'re willing to play politics with the health and safety of pregnant women and newborn babies.\xc2\xa0 Shame on them.\xc2\xa0 But, apparently, they have no shame.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the only explanation I can think of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President did a video yesterday about getting people to register to vote.\xc2\xa0 Is this the first time he has ever made a friendship bracelet?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As far as I know, yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I think the President made the crafting of that bracelet look rather difficult, so I suspect it was probably the first time that he had done it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he did.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn the back, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Puerto Rico, there is no guarantee that the Senate will pass a bill tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 The administration has said that it\xe2\x80\x99s this or nothing.\xc2\xa0 As the time gets closer to that July 1st deadline, are there any other options?\xc2\xa0 Are you guys considering anything else other than the bill?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, this is yet another example -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you raised it here before we wrapped up -- of Congress needing to act to protect the safety and well-being of millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0 In this case, we\'re talking about the 3.5 million Americans that live in Puerto Rico.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSecretary Lew, who has done yeoman\xe2\x80\x99s work to try to move this legislation across the finish line, has made clear that if Congress doesn\'t act, what is certainly possible is we\xe2\x80\x99ll find ourselves in a situation in which the Puerto Rico government has to take rash measures like emergency furloughs, and laying off police officers, or teachers, and health care workers.\xc2\xa0 They could potentially be faced with the need to shut down public buses and trains.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the reason for all of this is that because of the upcoming deadline, the government could face a responsibility to pay their bondholders and not provide these essential services.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, hopefully, we will avoid a situation in which Puerto Rican officials have to face this basic choice.\xc2\xa0 But there are grave consequences for congressional inaction.\xc2\xa0 And the ray of good news here is in an almost unprecedented step, we did see a majority of Democrats and majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives come together to pass a bill to address the situation in Puerto Rico.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe bill is imperfect.\xc2\xa0 But it is something that would prevent these kinds of consequences.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a bailout.\xc2\xa0 But a bailout only becomes more likely if Congress doesn\'t act.\xc2\xa0 That is a scenario that Democrats and Republicans in the Congress should avoid.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re hopeful that Democrats and Republicans in the Senate will come together in the same way that Democrats and Republicans in the House did to support an imperfect but critically important piece of legislation that would have an impact on the lives of 3.5 million Americans living in Puerto Rico.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the only option at this point?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is the only option that can avert the potential consequences of this deadline.\xc2\xa0 And again, hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll see the kind of bipartisan action in the Senate that we surprisingly saw in the House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, everybody.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:44 P.M.
