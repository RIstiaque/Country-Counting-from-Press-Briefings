Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t11:32 A.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon -- or good morning.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Before I get started, as some of you have seen reported, I can tell you that later this afternoon the President will meet with Aung San Suu Kyi at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to her visit as it provides another opportunity to reaffirm our longstanding support for her struggle, and the struggle of many others towards democratic, just, and transparent governance in Burma.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is her first trip to the United States in more than 20 years.\xc2\xa0 The President very much looks forward to that visit.\xc2\xa0 That\'s all I have at the top.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What time?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Late afternoon around 5:00 p.m.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be a photo spray?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still -- press coverage TBD, but we\xe2\x80\x99re working on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two foreign policy issues.\xc2\xa0 Reports that Iran is using Iraqi airspace to deliver weapons to Syria, the issue came up today in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\xc2\xa0 What steps is the President prepared to take to prevent Iraq from allowing Iran into its airspace?\xc2\xa0 Any conditions on financial aid or anything like that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say broadly that we have made clear to countries around the world that we all need to work together to prevent Assad from acquiring weapons that he can use to continue to perpetrate violence against his own people, and that\'s a message that we carry in conversations with leaders everywhere.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\'t have anything specific for you with regards to Iraq, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the meeting on the Hill that you referenced.\xc2\xa0 But that is something we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about generally.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve worked very hard with our international partners to cut off access to weapons and financing for Assad, and we continue to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On China, Secretary Panetta returned from his trip there, and we quoted that Chinese leaders are expressing concern over our U.S. military shift to the Pacific.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any concerns that that, together with the attention that China has been getting in the presidential campaign, is increasing any tensions with the Chinese?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I said yesterday holds true today, which is that we have a very complex, broad relationship with China that is extremely important.\xc2\xa0 And when we meet with the Chinese at the level of the President and below, we engage with them on all of the issues that are part of our relationship, and that includes areas of disagreement as well as areas of cooperation and agreement.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have an important trade relationship and economic relationship, as well as military-to-military relationship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe are, as the President made clear on his trip to Asia last fall, a Pacific power.\xc2\xa0 We have a presence there that\'s important to the United States and to the region, and we intend to pursue that.\xc2\xa0 But if this is about broader issues than China, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the fact that the United States is obviously a Pacific power with Pacific interests.\xc2\xa0 And you know that this President believes that in the eight years prior to him taking office there was a loss of focus when it comes to Asia, by the previous administration, because of all the concentrated attention on Iraq in particular.\xc2\xa0 And he has sought to rebalance our national security, foreign policy, and international economic posture towards Asia for that reason.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are some protests in China that the U.S. presence has emboldened other countries like Japan on territorial disputes.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel that -- do you want to put your finger on the scale on issues like that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, look, we believe that good relations between China and Japan benefit everyone in the region.\xc2\xa0 And U.S. policy on the Senkaku Islands, which I think is the issue at the moment, is longstanding and has not changed.\xc2\xa0 The United States does not take a position on the question of the ultimate sovereignty of the islands, and we expect the claimants to resolve the issue through peaceful means among themselves.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President have any reaction to the end of the teacher strike in Chicago yesterday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 His position has been that he hoped to see both sides in the dispute come together, reach an agreement that could serve and would serve the interests that were paramount -- the interest of the children of Chicago, the students in the Chicago school system.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly welcomes resolution to the dispute and welcomes the fact that kids have returned to class this morning.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And at the risk of sounding like a broken record, oil prices are falling again.\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything updated today to say about the SPR and your thinking about that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Our thinking remains what it was.\xc2\xa0 In regular consultation with our international partners, we monitor global oil markets and we keep all options on the table to deal with disruptions if necessary.\xc2\xa0 But I have no announcements to make on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a price level that would change this thinking at all of oil prices and/or gasoline prices in this country?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jeff, it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing that I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into great specificity on.\xc2\xa0 We simply monitor the situation mindful of the impact that higher global oil prices have on global economic growth, American economic growth, and mindful of all the various implications that arise when you have a situation like that.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the details of price levels or reserve levels, and suffice it to say that the President insists that all options for dealing with this issue remain on the table, and that includes the SPR.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned yesterday -- just last follow-up on this -- you were pleased about Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s action.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about what types of negotiations or discussions happened between the White House or U.S. officials and Saudi officials on this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I can simply say that we welcome the Saudi Arabian oil minister\xe2\x80\x99s recent remarks and share his concerns about rising oil prices, broadly speaking, not in recent days, but rising prices in the international oil market.\xc2\xa0 And we welcome Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s continued commitment to take all necessary steps to ensure the market is well supplied and to help moderate prices.\xc2\xa0 But we have ongoing consultations and conversations with our allies and our partners, including Saudi Arabia, on this issue and many others.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the wake of the attacks in Benghazi, the Pentagon and the State Department both made statements but then had to correct the Pentagon involving whether there were Marines at the embassy in Tripoli -- there were not -- and the State Department, regarding the presence of security firms at the Benghazi compound.\xc2\xa0 Why was there such confusion?\xc2\xa0 And is the White House or anyone conducting any sort of internal investigation as to what went wrong?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is an ongoing investigation into what happened in Benghazi that\xe2\x80\x99s being led by the FBI and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not that one.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about the criminal act.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the -- obviously, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t adequate security -- along the lines of what went wrong, what the administration could have done better.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I think I would refer you for questions about security at the Benghazi diplomatic facility and broadly speaking at diplomatic facilities, consulates, and embassies around the world to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 In terms of statements that were corrected by Defense or State, I would refer you to those departments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFrom our perspective, we got out to you the information that we had as soon as we had it and it was available.\xc2\xa0 And our assessment of what happened has been based on the best available information that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had.\xc2\xa0 There is an ongoing investigation led by the FBI, now going back to specifically what happened in Benghazi, and we await the results of that investigation for more information about the protests and the attacks and what precipitated them and who participated in them, with the primary objective here of fulfilling the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment that those people responsible for the deaths of four Americans be brought to justice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What reason could there be -- or let me rephrase that -- who made the decision that there should not be Marines at our diplomatic post in Libya?\xc2\xa0 More than half of our diplomatic posts have Marines.\xc2\xa0 I understand they\'re not there to protect people, they\'re there to protect classified data, but it doesn\'t hurt to have them there.\xc2\xa0 Who made the decision?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think security at diplomatic facilities is overseen by and run by the State Department, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them about how decisions are made and what the allocation of resources was in Benghazi and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 I think they\'re the best people to answer that question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned that there was a failure by someone in the administration to ensure adequate security measures whether through --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is concerned that violent actions were taken that led to the deaths of four Americans.\xc2\xa0 You can be sure that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about that, and he is absolutely concerned that we take the necessary measures to make sure that those who killed Americans are brought to justice.\xc2\xa0 And he has been focused from the beginning on ensuring that adequate security reinforcements be brought to bear at embassies and consulates and diplomatic facilities where that\'s deemed necessary.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, there is an investigation -- I think a broad investigation into what happened and how and why in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 And we will await the results.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s about the perpetrators of the violence.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it encompasses everything that happened.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that they will look at everything that happened there.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I would refer you to the FBI for details.\xc2\xa0 Look, Jake, I think what happened in --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It just seems -- you have the anniversary of 9/11, an unstable country with roving bands of individuals who are armed, a government that says it itself cannot provide security, it\xe2\x80\x99s not ready to do so yet, and it would just seem not that complicated to discern that there need to be some sort of serious security effort there to protect our diplomats.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I appreciate the question, and I understand it.\xc2\xa0 And I can simply say that there is an active investigation into what happened in Benghazi that led to the killing of four Americans.\xc2\xa0 And the President has taken action to make sure that we have reinforced security at facilities as deemed necessary and is very focused on ensuring that we bring to justice those who killed Americans abroad.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I appreciate your question, and I think that we are awaiting the results of the FBI investigation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On one other subject.\xc2\xa0 Did the President have any response to the Office of Special Counsel report on Secretary Sebelius violating the Hatch Act?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not spoken to him about it.\xc2\xa0 I think that Secretary Sebelius has responded to that and made sure that what was in -- her remarks were extemporaneous.\xc2\xa0 The Health and Human Services Department has since reclassified the event to meet the correct standard.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. Treasury has been reimbursed, and Secretary Sebelius has met with ethics experts to ensure that this never happens again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe error was immediately acknowledged by the Secretary and promptly corrected, and no taxpayer dollars were misused.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it safe to assume that as far as the President is concerned, that\'s the end of the matter?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to assume that action has been taken by the Secretary and the department to remedy what was the result of an inadvertent error based on extemporaneous remarks.\xc2\xa0 And she acknowledged it immediately, promptly corrected it, and ensured that no taxpayer dollars were used, and that the department reclassified the event to make sure that the correct standards were met.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Dan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Aside from the FBI investigation, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the White House have its own intelligence that would allow you to say with some degree of certainty that the attack in Benghazi was either a coordinated attack or a spontaneous reaction to the movie?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The White House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have its own intelligence, Dan.\xc2\xa0 The White House has --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have its own intelligence on this?\xc2\xa0 I mean --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Outside of the intelligence community of the United States government?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, outside of the FBI investigation?\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting that we have a clandestine intelligence operation here in the White House?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 You are able to find out a lot of information on your own, independently.\xc2\xa0 And what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, in addition to what the FBI is doing, does the White House not have information that it has gathered that will allow --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the FBI is leading an investigation that will encompass all of the information available to the White House and to the intelligence community and to the broader diplomatic community.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that, as I said last week, as our Ambassador to the United Nations said on Sunday and as I said the other day, based on what we know now and knew at the time, we have no evidence of a preplanned or premeditated attack.\xc2\xa0 This, however, remains under investigation, and I made that clear last week, and Ambassador Rice made that clear on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 And if more facts come to light that change our assessment of what transpired in Benghazi and why and how, we will welcome those facts and make you aware of them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut again, based on the information that we had at the time and have to this day, we do not have evidence that it was premeditated.\xc2\xa0 It is a simple fact that there are, in post-revolution, post-war Libya, armed groups, there are bad actors hostile to the government, hostile to the West, hostile to the United States.\xc2\xa0 And as has been the case in other countries in the region, it is certainly conceivable that these groups take advantage of and exploit situations that develop, when they develop, to protest against or attack either Westerners, Americans, Western sites or American sites.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s under investigation.\xc2\xa0 We have provided you our assessment based on the information we\xe2\x80\x99ve had as it\xe2\x80\x99s become available.\xc2\xa0 As more information becomes available, we will make clear what the investigation has revealed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And another question on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Given some of the developments that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen there recently, does the President still believe that Afghan forces are capable of handling their own security and will be able to do so in time for the 2014 deadline?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that after a decade of war, we can and should pursue a strategy that transitions security authority over to Afghan forces and allows us to end the war in Afghanistan and bring home our men and women in uniform.\xc2\xa0 That process is underway.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have gotten to this point because the President, having inherited a policy in Afghanistan that was widely viewed as adrift, without a focused mission, under-resourced, he very deliberately, working with his national security team, honed in on what the proper objectives should be in Afghanistan; made clear that our number-one objective in that region was to disrupt, dismantle, and ultimately defeat al Qaeda, and to ensure, in support of that goal, that Afghanistan could not become a safe haven again for al Qaeda or other extremists who have as their objective attacking the United States or U.S. allies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the execution of that strategy continues.\xc2\xa0 It led initially to a surge in U.S. forces, which halted the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s momentum; which allowed us to take the fight to al Qaeda in the region in a way that we had not been able to before; that led to the decimation of al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, including the elimination of Osama bin Laden; and has now allowed us to draw down the surge forces and to continue the transition to Afghan security forces\xe2\x80\x99 responsibility for security of that country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat process continues, as I said the other day.\xc2\xa0 We are very concerned about the green-on-blue attacks that have been taking place in Afghanistan, the increase in those attacks.\xc2\xa0 And our commanders are taking measures to ensure that there is more security for our troops in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 But the process of partnering with and training Afghan security forces continues, and the process of transitioning to Afghan security lead continues.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made clear that the pace -- that the drawdown of U.S. forces will continue.\xc2\xa0 The pace of that will depend on evaluations by and assessments by commanders on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But it will continue, and he remains committed to ending the war in Afghanistan in keeping with the NATO objectives by 2014.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it continues, but does he think they will be prepared to handle their own security?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks to the extraordinary sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and our partners\xe2\x80\x99 men and women in uniform, we have made tremendous strides towards enhancing the capacity of and the numbers of Afghan security forces.\xc2\xa0 And that remains a fact even as we contend with this serious problem with green-on-blue attacks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt is true that while we have changed the directives involved in partnering with Afghan forces, it remains true that for a long time now there have been an extraordinary number of missions conducted successfully where U.S. forces or ISAF forces have partnered with Afghan forces.\xc2\xa0 And it is essential for Afghans\xe2\x80\x99 future that Afghan security forces be able to take over security for their country.\xc2\xa0 And it is certainly in the interest of the United States that after a decade of war we continue with that transition in keeping with the President\xe2\x80\x99s mission.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the government still maintains that there was no evidence of a preplanned attack, how come --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, let me just repeat now, again, that based on the information --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how is it that the attackers had RPGs, automatic weapons, mortars?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve done a little bit of reading about Libya since the unrest that began under Qaddafi.\xc2\xa0 The place is -- has an abundance of weapons, and there are --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No question about it.\xc2\xa0 But do you expect a street mob to come armed that way?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are, unfortunately, many bad actors in that country as there are throughout the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point, Jay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And they have -- they\xe2\x80\x99re very armed.\xc2\xa0 The point is you can make suppositions about what happened.\xc2\xa0 We prefer to have an investigation that looks very closely into what happened, and assembles the facts and presents them.\xc2\xa0 Based on -- all I\xe2\x80\x99m saying --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But our people on the ground have seen the fragments of the -- the remains of the mortars and the heavy weapons that were used.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear that there were armed assailants who used heavy weapons.\xc2\xa0 We obviously haven\xe2\x80\x99t disputed that.\xc2\xa0 And --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is just a random crowd that got together with their heavy weapons, insulted by the film, and decided to go --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I think I just said, there has certainly been precedent in the past where bad actors, extremists who are heavily armed in different countries, in different regions of the world, have taken advantage of and exploited situations that have developed in order to either attack Westerners or Western assets or American assets.\xc2\xa0 That is not --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They might plan to do it, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They might or they might not.\xc2\xa0 All I can tell you is, based on the information we had at the time -- we have now, we do not yet have indication that it was preplanned or premeditated.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an active investigation.\xc2\xa0 If that active investigation produces facts that lead to a different conclusion, we will make clear that that\xe2\x80\x99s where the investigation has led.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- our interest is in finding out the facts of what happened, not taking what we\xe2\x80\x99ve read in the newspaper and making bold assertions that we know what happened.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d rather investigate it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it seem likely, given the circumstances?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that goes back to making presumptions about what happened and we\xe2\x80\x99d rather investigate it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there were a fair number of questions yesterday about the Romney tape and what he had to say.\xc2\xa0 There is a tape that the Republicans immediately tried to distribute yesterday, I guess to push back this fairly old -- 14 years ago, the President talking about redistribution.\xc2\xa0 My question is, from a policy standpoint, the Republicans seem to be trying to use that tape to suggest that the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to redistribute income and wealth.\xc2\xa0 And can you say from a policy standpoint whether that is a fair characterization?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I would say that all of us who follow politics and policy, whether we\xe2\x80\x99re on this side or your side of the podium, have seen circumstances like this where a campaign is having a very bad day or a very bad week.\xc2\xa0 And in circumstances like that, there are efforts made -- sometimes desperate efforts made to change the subject.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe charge based on this 14-year old video sounds very familiar to one that was tried and failed in 2008.\xc2\xa0 Fourteen years ago, then-Senator Obama was making an argument for a more efficient, more effective government, specifically citing city government agencies that he did not think were working effectively.\xc2\xa0 He believed then and believes now that there are steps we can take to promote opportunity and ensure that all Americans have a fair shot if they work hard.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe, as some apparently do, that any student who looks for a government-backed loan is looking for a handout; or that a senior citizen receiving Social Security is a freeloader; or a combat veteran not paying taxes is a victim.\xc2\xa0 He believes that we need to make government more effective, more efficient.\xc2\xa0 He believed that then, he believes it now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when he says \xe2\x80\x9cpool resources\xe2\x80\x9d in that tape, that we need to pool resources, and he believes in redistribution, does that -- since you\xe2\x80\x99re characterizing what he meant 14 years ago and with confidence, was he also suggesting he believes in redistribution of wealth?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we have to have a government that works efficiently and effectively and wisely in the use of taxpayer dollars on behalf of the American people, that advances the American economy, that helps provide opportunity to middle-class Americans and those seeking to enter the middle class.\xc2\xa0 He certainly believes that programs like Social Security and Medicare -- that every American who works, contributes to -- are beneficial for the entire society.\xc2\xa0 And those programs use money that you and I put in every week to ensure that your grandmother and my grandmother have health care now.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a wise use of government resources and taxpayer dollars.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut again, if you look at what he said back then, it was all about his concern, as a state senator, with inefficient, ineffective local government programs, and the need to make them more efficient and more effective.\xc2\xa0 And that is a focus and a concern that he has brought here to Washington first as a senator and now as President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the last question.\xc2\xa0 Beyond the attacks back and forth, the Wall Street Journal today cites U.S. census data that says that in 2011, 49 percent of the population lived in a household receiving some sort of government benefits, and that back in the \xe2\x80\x9980s it was only 30 percent.\xc2\xa0 So my question would be, do you think, since the President does talk a lot in his stump about the debt problem, about balancing the budget, is that a sustainable path to go from 30 percent to 49 percent in terms of people receiving benefits?\xc2\xa0 Is that sustainable?\xc2\xa0 Can you actually balance the budget if we\xe2\x80\x99re headed in that direction?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you have to look at what those benefits are.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have grown older as a nation.\xc2\xa0 And if you\xe2\x80\x99re questioning whether or not Social Security is a necessary and beneficial program for America\xe2\x80\x99s seniors, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s answer would be clear: Yes, it is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIs it absolutely essential that Medicare as we know it remain in place to provide health care to America\xe2\x80\x99s seniors?\xc2\xa0 Yes, it is.\xc2\xa0 Are veterans\xe2\x80\x99 benefits -- and we certainly have a large number of veterans and veterans who need assistance returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- are those benefits necessary and helpful to American society?\xc2\xa0 The answer absolutely is yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, there have been a lot of assessments of the 47 percent figure; some of them very interesting and I think substantive and worth examining.\xc2\xa0 It was noted in a different context when we talk about effective tax rates, all those hardworking Americans, everybody who pays payroll taxes, is working and earning a paycheck, and a lot of them are paying a higher effective tax rate -- even if their federal income tax is extremely low or zero -- than some millionaires and billionaires out there because of the carried interest law or other measures by which somebody like Warren Buffett or others can manage to pay a far lower effective tax rate than a school teacher or a bus driver or a police officer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President believes that when we talk about tax reform, that\'s one of the things that we need to fix so that the tax system is more fair.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You used the word \xe2\x80\x9cdesperate.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So the White House believes the Romney campaign has gotten desperate, you said?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I made an observation as a keen observer of the political scene that when a campaign is having a bad day or a bad week, or some might say a bad month --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why stop there?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And this has been true in campaigns from both parties, candidates of all stripes, you sometimes witness an effort to -- that seems desperate to change the subject.\xc2\xa0 We might be witnessing that now.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I leave it up to the experts, including you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d normally refer those questions to Chicago, but you seem to be willing to weigh in on the campaign now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I had a four-shot espresso before I got out here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to go back to the surge for a moment.\xc2\xa0 To be clear, have all of the surge forces now been withdrawn?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Of the so-called surge forces, I believe 33,000 roughly are due to be fully withdrawn by the end of this month.\xc2\xa0 I would have to check on the absolute status right now.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe they\'re to a person completely withdrawn yet, but they are due to be withdrawn by the end of the month.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t have any updates about whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually been withdrawn?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe that every single person has been withdrawn yet, but again, the timetable is they will be brought out by the end of the month.\xc2\xa0 And my understanding is -- I would refer you to the Pentagon for more details, but my understanding is that that timetable is being met.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, Senators McCain, Lieberman, and Graham put out a statement today saying that the green-on-blue attacks were actually precipitated by the overly speedy drawdown of the surge troops, and they recommended the administration \xe2\x80\x9ctake a step back and reconsider withdrawing surge troops in light of these insider attacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 And is this under consideration at all?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We disagree.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that it is absolutely essential to continue with the transition to Afghan security lead, that after a decade of war -- more -- in Afghanistan, it is time to wind down that war and to gradually transfer security responsibility to the Afghans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have expended a great deal of blood and treasure in that effort, and it is through the heroic and remarkable service of our men and women in uniform in particular that we are at a place now where Afghan security forces have developed capabilities and have developed the numbers that allows them to gradually take over security lead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe green-on-blue attacks are a very concerning problem, and action is being taken to protect against those kinds of attacks.\xc2\xa0 But it does not change the mission; the mission continues.\xc2\xa0 And I mean, with regard to those assessments, I would simply note that when this President took office, he inherited an Afghan policy -- an Afghan policy from the previous administration that was largely endorsed by some of the very same critics of the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy -- in which there were a fraction of the number of troops that this President allocated to the effort in Afghanistan and the AfPak region, and nothing like the kind of focus on a clear mission on the disruption, dismantlement, and defeat of al Qaeda that this President has pursued.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President made clear in the 2008 campaign that we needed to refocus attention on Afghanistan, that we needed to end the war in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 He has fulfilled the promise to end to war in Iraq, and he is fulfilling his promise with regards to Afghanistan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not linked to the drawdown of the surge forces, has the administration gotten closer to figuring out what is behind this uptick in violence?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For details on this, I think the Pentagon and ISAF would be the best places to go.\xc2\xa0 I think one thing that I understand to be true and that is the assessment of our commanders in the field is that because of the success we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in halting the momentum of the Taliban and retaking territory controlled by the Taliban, this is a tactic that is being used as an alternative by the Taliban and other extremists, which might argue against some of the assertions being made that you cite.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut let me be clear, this is very concerning, and that is why the steps are being taken by our commanders in the field, by General Allen and others, but it does not change the mission.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMargaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you a couple of follow-up questions about the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi later today.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit more about what it says about how he sees her role both in Burma or Myanmar and also more broadly in the region that the meeting is happening?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd in terms of diplomacy, I know like if the Dalai Lama visits, the President has to kind of give considerations about how to position that vis-\xc3\xa0-vis the Chinese government.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how this compares.\xc2\xa0 Did the U.S. give Burma a heads-up?\xc2\xa0 Diplomacy-wise, was there any issue or concern about that visit in terms of how the U.S. goes forward?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President very much looks forward to this visit.\xc2\xa0 The President views Aung San Suu Kyi very much as you described her, which is -- and I did before -- which is as somebody who has been a remarkable beacon for democratic reform in her country and for her people.\xc2\xa0 And that struggle has lasted for many, many years, and it is certainly appropriate that she will be receiving the Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of her many-year struggle in Burma, a struggle that is resulting now in her visit and in the remarkable reforms that have been undertaken by President Thein Sein, in Burma.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as I think we discussed the other day when I was asked about her visit and reforms underway and reciprocal actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking in response to those forms, a great deal has been transpiring in Myanmar, Burma, and we continue to work with President Thein Sein and the government there, as well as others, to help the cause of reform and to help the cause of the democratic process there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the visit itself and the symbolism that that connotes what\xe2\x80\x99s more important?\xc2\xa0 Or do you expect that they\'re going to actually discuss anything substantive that he\xe2\x80\x99s asking her for information about or vice versa?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to read out a conversation that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken place yet.\xc2\xa0 I know he looks forward to meeting with her.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s spoken with her by phone in the past but has not met with her.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there will be substantive elements to the discussion.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut it is certainly the case that we are engaged with the government of Myanmar very actively when it comes to the reforms that we have been urging them to put in place, and that they have been putting in place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Circling back to the video again, on the Middle East -- yesterday you said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t leadership, it was the opposite of leadership for Mitt Romney to say that a solution in the Middle East is an issue that should be kicked down the field.\xc2\xa0 But if you look at the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s record on the Middle East for at least the past 12 months, it seems as though the White House is effectively kicking it down the field as well.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen Senator Mitchell left as special enjoy he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t replaced at a similar level.\xc2\xa0 The President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t announced a major or even modest new initiative on the Middle East since the speech he gave on the Middle East early last year.\xc2\xa0 And diplomatic engagement by the U.S. on this issue is by all accounts at a very low level.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I guess the question I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is, is it fair for the White House to say that he\xe2\x80\x99s showing no leadership in saying he\xe2\x80\x99s kicking it down the field when it appears that you guys are kicking it down the field as well?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would contest the premise.\xc2\xa0 As you know, Mark, when this President came into office, he made this a priority and he has taken steps to try to advance the peace process.\xc2\xa0 And this is a very, very difficult problem -- there is no question -- and it has been a problem that previous Presidents have worked to resolve.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that we are still short of peace does not mean we should throw up our hands and preemptively tell our supporters, or tell the American people, or the Israelis or the Palestinians, that we\xe2\x80\x99re not even going to try.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis President is committed to taking steps to move the Middle East peace process forward, to bringing the two parties to the table to negotiate a lasting peace.\xc2\xa0 That is the only way that a two-state solution can be achieved that provides the security that Israel deserves and needs, and the sovereignty that the Palestinian people seek.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we have -- I would certainly not argue that we have not met with the kind of success in those efforts that we all desire, and we believe that a majority of Palestinians and Israelis desire, but we will continue to work on the issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd my point was that leadership is about acknowledging the difficulty of the challenges you face and trying to tackle them.\xc2\xa0 It is not preemptively announcing that they\xe2\x80\x99re too hard, so why bother.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, I take your point about the difficulty of it.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering what evidence you can point to that the President has continued to push hard on this.\xc2\xa0 Because if you look at it from the outside, it does appear that he\xe2\x80\x99s made perhaps a very valid decision, a very defensible decision, that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get anywhere between now and the election at least, so he\xe2\x80\x99s chosen to put it on the back burner.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we continue to press both sides to come to the negotiating table to resolve these very difficult issues that remain the obstacles to a lasting peace.\xc2\xa0 And we have come at this problem in a variety of ways and will continue to work with our international partners, with the Israelis and Palestinians in that effort.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, I concede that this is a challenge.\xc2\xa0 I concede that this President, like his predecessors, so many of them, has not succeeded in helping bring about that final and lasting peace between the two parties.\xc2\xa0 But it is too important an issue to disregard and declare unsolvable.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not in the interest of the United States, it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the interest of the Israelis, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the interest of the Palestinians.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it is stated policy of both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority that a two-state solution should be pursued.\xc2\xa0 And it is certainly the policy of this administration and predecessors of this administration, both Republican and Democratic, that it should be pursued, and it is the correct avenue to achieving peace in that region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this President will continue that effort, hopefully beyond January of next year, and accepts that it\xe2\x80\x99s a challenge but believes deeply that it\xe2\x80\x99s a challenge that we have to meet.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The French government has decided to temporarily close their embassies and schools in several Muslim countries after a satirical weekly, Charlie Hebdo, that published cartoons mocking the Prophet Muhammad.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House concerned that those cartoons might further fan the flames in the region?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are aware that a French magazine published cartoons featuring a figure resembling the Prophet Muhammad, and obviously, we have questions about the judgment of publishing something like this.\xc2\xa0 We know that these images will be deeply offensive to many and have the potential to be inflammatory.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken repeatedly about the importance of upholding the freedom of expression that is enshrined in our Constitution.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn other words, we don\xe2\x80\x99t question the right of something like this to be published; we just question the judgment behind the decision to publish it.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s our view about the video that was produced in this country and has caused so much offense in the Muslim world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, it has to be said, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it again, that no matter how offensive something like this is, it is not in any way justification for violence -- not in any way justification for violence.\xc2\xa0 Now, we have been staying in close touch with the French government as well as other governments around the world, and we appreciate the statements of support by French government officials over the past week, denouncing the violence against Americans and our diplomatic missions overseas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAndrei.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the same subject.\xc2\xa0 Earlier today in Moscow there was a minor flare-up because the leader of the Russian communists, Mr. Zyuganov --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 (Speaks in Russian.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- supposedly said in his Twitter account something denigrating about the kill of American Ambassador.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t even want to go there and to repeat what he said -- he denies it, by the way.\xc2\xa0 But the story was -- most of the story was that it created an outrage in Washington and that the Americans will sanction Mr. Zyuganov, and on, and on, and on.\xc2\xa0 My question to you is, have you heard about this, about the whole circus of it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing about it for the first time, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of this report and I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any outrage here.\xc2\xa0 I just -- it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t brought to my attention.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you ever heard of someone being sanctioned in a situation like this for making an offensive comment about an American official?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not.\xc2\xa0 Again, I have not heard of this report.\xc2\xa0 I know of no basis to it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all I know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, following up on that line of questioning -- what if, if anything, is the White House doing to secure this homeland as skirmishes are happening overseas, this anti-American sentiment?\xc2\xa0 What is the President doing?\xc2\xa0 And if you could tell us -- what can you tell us?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that it is a fundamental reality of our contemporary life here in the post-9/11 world, but even prior to it, that we have to be extremely vigilant.\xc2\xa0 And that vigilance continues.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI have no specific briefing to give to you about actions taken in the wake of the protests and unrest in the Middle East, but I can assure you that our security team and our counterterrorism specialists are, as they always are, extremely vigilant about potential threats against the United States, here and against Americans here in the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, the President, when he first became President, he did this Muslim outreach, and he did it just for this reason -- to quell any kind of anti-American concern.\xc2\xa0 Is there a thought around the White House, or are there conversations among the senior staffers that that may need to happen again to do some kind of outreach so that this kind of anti-American sentiment will not cause more problems than what\xe2\x80\x99s going on right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put it that way, April.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that I remember well, since I covered it, that President Bush in the immediate aftermath of the terrible, devastating attacks on 9/11 spoke very clearly about the fact that we would not be and we\xe2\x80\x99re not at war with Islam.\xc2\xa0 And that remains the case.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a message that this President has carried from the beginning of his administration in echoing the very same sentiments that President Bush put forward in the wake of 9/11.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have made clear -- the President has, Secretary Clinton, Ambassador Rice, even the Press Secretary -- that we find the video that has been so offensive to Muslims to be disgusting and reprehensible and not something that in any way represents the values or the beliefs of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And we have made clear that, obviously, the American government had nothing to do with it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe make the additional point -- and it is an important point -- that no matter how offensive such a video is, there is no justification for violence.\xc2\xa0 There is no justification for attacking and killing innocent people.\xc2\xa0 In this case, in Benghazi, innocent Americans including an ambassador who had done so much to help the Libyan people and to help them emerge from the shadow of tyranny under Muammar Qaddafi.\xc2\xa0 And that is a message that needs to be very clear as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in the investigations about all the skirmishes and the initial skirmish that happened in Libya, has it been concluded that this was linked to trying to show America something on 9/11, to show anti-American sentiment on 9/11?\xc2\xa0 Is that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of questions about what we know about what precipitated the attacks in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 And I said earlier and have said on previous days that, based on the information we have now, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have evidence that it was premeditated or preplanned.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt is certainly the case that there are a number of bad actors and armed groups of extremists in Libya who might take advantage of a situation that was brought about initially as a response to the video in question.\xc2\xa0 But this is under active investigation and we await the results of that investigation by the FBI before we can reach any firm conclusions about what precipitated the attacks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right now we should say it\xe2\x80\x99s a coincidence that it all happened on 9/11?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right now I\xe2\x80\x99m saying we don\xe2\x80\x99t have evidence at this point that this was premeditated or preplanned to coincide on a -- to happen on a specific date or coincide with that anniversary.\xc2\xa0 If that changes, we will certainly make you aware of it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:24 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
