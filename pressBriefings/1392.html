GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Unusually quiet.\xc2\xa0 One quick announcement before I take your questions.\xc2\xa0 President Obama spoke today by video teleconference with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as part of continued consultations with our European partners.\xc2\xa0 The President and his counterparts discussed the international community\xe2\x80\x99s next steps on Iran, the Middle East peace process, and global economic issues.</p>\n<p>The President looks forward to hosting President Sarkozy next week for a bilateral meeting and to continue collaboration with these three close colleagues to advance our shared agenda.</p>\n<p>I should also mention they congratulated him on the passage and signing of comprehensive health care reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All three?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They did, all three.</p>\n<p>Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 Two foreign topics today.\xc2\xa0 On the START treaty, can you just give us a good assessment on where that stands?\xc2\xa0 Is a deal done?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have said on many occasions that we are making strong progress toward getting an agreement.\xc2\xa0 We are, I think, very close to having an agreement on a START treaty and -- but won\'t have one until President Obama and his counterpart, Mr. Medvedev, have a chance to speak again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that scheduled?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the time --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they will likely speak in the next few days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Next few days?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we were hearing Friday as a possible -- as the most likely day to pull all this together.\xc2\xa0 How would you assess that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say, again, I would characterize this as having made very strong progress.\xc2\xa0 You know the President spoke personally on March 13th to Mr. Medvedev and I think we\'re very close to getting an agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Israel, I\'d like to ask you briefly about the visit yesterday by Prime Minister Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 As you know, diplomacy involves not just the substance of the event, but how it\xe2\x80\x99s handled.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, there were really none of the normal trappings of a foreign visit, in terms of press coverage and even a readout.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain a little bit about why the White House decided to handle it that way?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me categorize -- the President and the Prime Minister met, first off, the Oval, and had an honest and straightforward discussion about our relationship, about regional security and about comprehensive peace efforts.\xc2\xa0 The President asked the Prime Minister to take steps to build confidence for proximity talks so that progress can be made towards comprehensive Middle East peace.\xc2\xa0 There are areas of agreement, there are areas of disagreement, and that conversation is ongoing.</p>\n<p>The Prime Minister arrived a little after 5:30 p.m.\xc2\xa0 That meeting concluded a little after 7:00 p.m. last evening.\xc2\xa0 The President went back to the residence.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Netanyahu remained in the White House and consulted with his staff in the Roosevelt Room and then requested to see the President again, and they returned to the Oval Office at about 8:20 p.m. and met for a little more than half an hour.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the substance, just one second on that -- but back to my original question about the handling of this.\xc2\xa0 Why did the White House decide to handle -- that was so low profile.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve handled different visits in different ways and this is the way we felt most comfortable handling this one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern about how it could be perceived -- particularly by Jewish voters or Jewish donors -- that this was a cold-shoulder kind of visit or there was anything less than a full extension?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I -- look, they spoke for over two hours last night, face to face, so I think -- we have a strong relationship with a strong ally.\xc2\xa0 There are areas that they discussed last night, some of which they agree and some of which they disagree.\xc2\xa0 And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, those talks are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And\xc2\xa0 -- but the conversation was honest and straightforward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one follow on that.\xc2\xa0 Particularly on the issue of settlements, what did the President ask of the Prime Minister, and how do you think that went?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m, at this point, not going to get into walking through the substance of what they discussed.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the confidence-building measures, the Prime Minister made clear going into the meeting that he had no intention of backing down on the demand for freezing construction in East Jerusalem.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there were any goodwill gestures or any concessions made?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the substance of what they talked about at each of the meetings.\xc2\xa0 Again, we have asked the Prime Minister to take steps to build confidence for proximity talks to be able to make progress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you explain why there were two meetings?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, there was a meeting -- the original meeting, the President -- at the conclusion of that meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu wanted not to leave but instead meet with staff -- his staff here, his team here.\xc2\xa0 They did so in the Oval Office [sic].\xc2\xa0 At some point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exact timing, but at some point, they came -- word was sent out of that meeting that the Prime Minister would like to see the President -- requested to see the President again, and the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were there any presidential aides in the Roosevelt Room at the time?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not in the Roosevelt Room, no.\xc2\xa0 I believe somebody was sent out to locate us.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the Prime Minister met with the staff in the Roosevelt Room?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 With his staff, yes, yes -- in the Roosevelt Room.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President expect to see Netanyahu again today or tomorrow maybe?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing on the schedule right now, no.\xc2\xa0 I think Prime Minister Netanyahu has some meetings scheduled later on today with administration staff.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing on the schedule for --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s here or --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he expect answers from Netanyahu?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly where those meetings are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he expect answers from Netanyahu before he leaves town tonight or tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the conversations that the Prime Minister and the President are having are ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Israel is confirming further plans to expand housing in East Jerusalem.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I asked -- specifically asked our team on this. They said they are seeking clarification on that announcement.\xc2\xa0 And I will withhold comment until we have clarification based on some questions they have for the Israelis on that.\xc2\xa0 I would say this:\xc2\xa0 I think our position is fairly well known.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On financial regulatory reform, can you talk about the meeting with Dodd and Frank, and what the prospects are for a bipartisan deal?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to need some Republican help in the Senate to get something done on this.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, quite frankly, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen comments today from Senator Corker saying that he believes there will be Republicans that do support financial reform.\xc2\xa0 I think the President had a good meeting with Chairman Frank and Chairman Dodd, thanked them both for their work in moving this process through.\xc2\xa0 Chairman Dodd has a bill now through the committee process.\xc2\xa0 I think the President expects that we will finish financial reform in the next couple of months, certainly by the time we mark the second anniversary of the financial collapse in the early fall.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the President is going to be taking a hands-on role in trying to get this done as he did with health care in the final weeks?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to meet with Republicans to try to get them on board?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been very hands-on regarding financial reform, and I think it is one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priorities now, understanding, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times, that we need strong rules going forward to prevent the type of collapse we saw in the fall of 2008.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I just wanted to follow up on the question about Israel and keeping that event closed with the Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 You also have an event today where you\xe2\x80\x99re signing -- the President is signing an executive order on abortion that is a pretty big national issue.\xc2\xa0 Why would that be closed press, no pictures?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll put out a picture from Pete.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what about a picture from the actual national media, not from --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, the picture from Pete will be for the actual event.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but what about allowing us in, for openness and transparency?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a nice picture from Pete that will demonstrate that type of transparency.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not the same, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Never has been.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know you all disagree with that.\xc2\xa0 I think Pete takes wonderful photos.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, don\xe2\x80\x99t twist this --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not an attack on Pete.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you\xe2\x80\x99d want to attack Pete, Chuck, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stand up here and defend Pete\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not transparent and it\xe2\x80\x99s a vital issue.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And you will have a lovely picture from Pete.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You really think that\xe2\x80\x99s all it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, is a photograph, on an issue this important?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to see the President sign the executive order.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not hear anything anybody has to say?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have a nice picture.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask on another subject?\xc2\xa0 On another subject I wanted to ask about -- the President has been saying the last few days that one of the biggest benefits of the new health care law is that within six months children will no longer have preexisting conditions, and now various health experts are saying, well, when you read it more closely that\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xc2\xa0 So was the public misled on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the law is clear, Ed, that insurance companies cannot deny coverage to a child based on a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 Under the act, the plan includes -- plans that include coverage for children cannot deny coverage based on a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 To ensure that there is no ambiguity on this, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, is preparing to issue regulations next month making sure that the term \xe2\x80\x9cpreexisting\xe2\x80\x9d applies to both a child\xe2\x80\x99s access to a plan and his or her benefits once he or she is in a plan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if health insurance experts are already saying that they don\'t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s clear enough, then -- and they might not follow with new regulations --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Our lawyers are clear and the regulations -- we believe the law is clear.\xc2\xa0 The regulations will clear up any ambiguity from those experts.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the President asked Netanyahu for confidence-building measures with the Palestinians and you mentioned that they had areas of agreement and disagreement.\xc2\xa0 Can you be any more specific on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, not right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you -- when the President holds events and does not allow photographers in it implies that the President is hiding something, is not -- is embarrassed about something, is uncomfortable for photographs of that event to be made public.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I disagree with all three of those characterizations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to people who say that the way that the President has welcomed Netanyahu to the White House has been as if he\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassed to be seen with Netanyahu -- with not even allowing one of Souza\xe2\x80\x99s photographs of it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we were very comfortable with the coverage for last night\xe2\x80\x99s meeting.\xc2\xa0 They had --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was no coverage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No coverage -- there was no coverage.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We were comfortable with that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you only pleased when there\xe2\x80\x99s no coverage?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\'re --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re pleased when there\xe2\x80\x99s no coverage?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re pleased that -- we were pleased with the way we set up the coverage for last night.\xc2\xa0 Not every -- I know this comes as a great shock to both you and to me --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- transparent.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it comes as a great shock to you and me, but not everything the President does is for the cameras and for the press.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not the American people --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t see any contradiction at all when the Secretary of State goes before AIPAC and says that the U.S. has no stronger, no closer ally than Israel -- and then the President won\'t even allow a photograph of him and the Israeli Prime Minister --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t see a contradiction at all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- as if he\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassed to be seen with him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s your characterization, not mine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned about photographs of him and Netanyahu being seen in the world?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I forget Mark Knoller\xe2\x80\x99s statistics but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the second visit that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- I think there have been many pictures of and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Never of a one-on-one.\xc2\xa0 Not a single one-on-one.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, that\'s not true.\xc2\xa0 There was --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were just the trio pictures.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, that\'s not true.\xc2\xa0 There was a spray in the Oval Office with just the two of them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s right -- talking about Iran.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not the last time.\xc2\xa0 This is two times in a row --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s true.\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one other question about the executive order the President is signing today?\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that this executive order is necessary?\xc2\xa0 Does he think that there was ambiguity in the law?\xc2\xa0 Or does he think that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any ambiguity but this was just done because people like Bart Stupak wanted it done?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say the President believed that the law -- the President has always believed that health care reform should be about that, not about other issues.\xc2\xa0 The President did not, in health care reform, believe we did change the status quo and believes that this reiterates that it\xe2\x80\x99s not changed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, it\xe2\x80\x99s just reiterating what is already in the law?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s an executive order so this isn\'t -- I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a frivolous thing, Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, of course not.\xc2\xa0 But does this executive order change anything that the law already didn\'t do?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It ensures that health care, the law the President signed yesterday, maintains the status quo of the federal law prohibiting the federal use -- the use of federal dollars for abortion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it is needed, that the law was not clear enough?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President reiterated that in the executive order.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So all he\xe2\x80\x99s doing is repeating what\xe2\x80\x99s in the law?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s just -- I mean, you can\xe2\x80\x99t have it both ways.\xc2\xa0 Either the executive order is needed to clarify something that\xe2\x80\x99s not --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I -- again, I would refer you to the executive order and the statements that we made about this over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I read the executive order, and it says that\xe2\x80\x99s a reiteration of what already exists.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there you go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not legally necessary?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We reiterated --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might have been necessary for other reasons, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not legally necessary.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, we reiterated the status quo, and we\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable reiterating that status quo.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- comfortable for a legal purpose?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable reiterating that status quo.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it diminish the whole purpose of a presidential -- of an executive order if all he\xe2\x80\x99s doing is reiterating what\xe2\x80\x99s already in the law?\xc2\xa0 Why would he do that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t see that as diminishing --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Iowa, is -- Iowa is on health care?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So has he already made the hard pivot to jobs, or are we still waiting for that to happen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we signed the jobs bill about a week ago, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s time -- signing a bill doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take much time -- but there was always this impression that at some point --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Signing a bill doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take much time, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he spend a lot of time on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We talked -- I think we laid out in December a plan for -- one of the things was a tax break for companies that hire the unemployed.\xc2\xa0 We talked in here extensively about the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s several different things that will go through Congress.\xc2\xa0 The next bill that the House will take up relating to jobs includes the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan for zero capital gains.\xc2\xa0 There are additional plans that we have to increase lending through community banks to small businesses so that they have adequate access to capital and credit to meet payrolls and to expand.</p>\n<p>Chip, the President has been working on the economy since day one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this pivot to jobs has already -- I mean, you talk about this year --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President has been --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- he was going to make a big pivot to jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And the President has --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has that happened or are we still waiting for it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the President has been focused on jobs.\xc2\xa0 He works on jobs every day.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Stupak and company, there have been death threats against some of these, and just some -- some children of these people have been used in advertisements.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it really has been extraordinary, some of the attacks some of these people have been coming under.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House -- is the President aware of that and has he had a response to it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the degree to which the President has seen some of that coverage, Chip.\xc2\xa0 But, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President would need to see the coverage to know that, as he has said countless times, regardless of the passion of your views -- he has very passionate beliefs and views, and believes in a country as big and as free as America that people should have a right to those passionate views.\xc2\xa0 But we ought to be -- we ought to exercise those views not in a way that threatens anybody\xe2\x80\x99s safety or security, not in any way that foments violence.\xc2\xa0 We ought to be able to, in a country as proud and as rich in tradition as the United States of America, to have a debate in a way that is civil and in a way that demonstrates both the passion of our beliefs, but in the values that we hold dearly as a country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to finish, does he have any plans for any job events coming up?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any details?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any of these amendments that Republicans are offering on the Senate floor this week, any of them here that the White House finds that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea, and you know what, maybe that should be added in?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chuck, we want the Senate to finish the corrections legislation so that the President can quickly sign it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, but there are a whole bunch of new amendments.\xc2\xa0 Anything strike the President --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say this.\xc2\xa0 I think that when you go through the different swing of what these amendments are directed at, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of game-playing going on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t take these amendments seriously?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think these are intended to create a political distraction.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99re intended, quite frankly, relating to the budget deficit, relating to health care, and I think if people find things that they want to correct in the legislation, ultimately we can do that through the regular legislative process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Iowa City, does he have any plans to meet with any of the local leaders in Cedar Rapids that are in the middle of this rebuilding effort after the big flood that they --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but I will check on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, finally, on the Israeli meeting, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that the Prime Minister came with sort of a set of proposals for the first meeting.\xc2\xa0 And is it -- did he -- was the whole point of him staying to tweak those --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and offer a new --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared at this point to read out or give substance for the meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you characterize it as a negotiation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 An honest and straightforward discussion that continues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy with mine, but -- no, I think -- again, I think they had an honest and straightforward discussion about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other administration officials, just to clarify, they\xe2\x80\x99re going off campus to meet with the Prime Minister today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it is meetings today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my sense.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- like I said, I don\'t know whether those meetings are here or elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Staff to staff, they met all the way to 1:00 a.m. in the morning.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 12:30ish a.m., yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the issue that the Israelis had to have two meetings with the President?\xc2\xa0 And on related -- does the President still believe in bipartisanship after this solid vote against health?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the meetings with Prime Minister Netanyahu, we --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we ought to know the substance.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And we are -- when we feel comfortable reading those meetings out, we will do so.\xc2\xa0 We --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are you hiding?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not hiding anything.\xc2\xa0 The conversations and the discussions are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 As Chuck mentioned, they continued into very early in the morning.\xc2\xa0 And staff-to-staff, those discussions have not formally continued, but they continue right now.\xc2\xa0 And, again, when we have something that we feel is able to be read out, we will do so.</p>\n<p>In terms of bipartisanship, Helen, I would say that -- Caren mentioned this earlier -- there are -- Senator Corker said that he thinks there are Republicans that will support financial reform.\xc2\xa0 I think --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 McCain said he\xe2\x80\x99s going to oppose everything.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, I find it curious that not getting your way on one thing means you\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to take your toys and go home.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work well for my six-year-old; I doubt it works well in the United States Senate, because we have issues that are important for his constituents and for all of America.</p>\n<p>Look, again, when it comes to financial reform people are going to have an opportunity to weigh in on behalf of the banks or on behalf of consumers.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll let their vote on that dictate which side of that ledger they feel most comfortable on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you comparing McCain to a six-year-old?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying that I think the notion that if you don\'t get what you want you\'re not going to cooperate on anything else is not a whole lot different than I might hear from a six-year-old.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the argument is not that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s the reconciliation process that has Republicans upset, Lindsey Graham included as well.\xc2\xa0 They\'re saying that spoils the bipartisan atmosphere.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not not getting what you want.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 When reconciliation happened in 2001 with the Bush tax cuts I didn\'t sense that it spoiled the ability for Congress to continue working together.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t see why that would happen now, unless people decided that they were going to take their toys and go home.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you clarify exactly why a regulation is needed for the preexisting condition issue for children?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All I said was that regulations have to happen regarding a lot of aspects of the legislation in order to ensure that any ambiguity -- if there is any ambiguity, that regulations will clearly denote that somebody that offers a plan that covers children cannot deny anybody coverage based on a preexisting condition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe there is ambiguity right now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 But we will seek to ensure that there -- that nobody feels that there is any ambiguity, based on the regulations that the Secretary of Health and Human Services will put forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this a particular regulation on this one issue, or a regulation on the whole package that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think there will be regulations, obviously, surrounding any number of issues in this.\xc2\xa0 This is -- the answer that I gave on that is particular to preexisting conditions for children.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, before the regulation is issued, is the President going to continue talking about that as an immediate benefit?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 It is an immediate benefit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, so, to segue from that, Robert, when will this rule kick in for the coverage of --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The rules that -- the immediate benefits that I described a couple of days ago -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll find the exact number of days; there are differences for different things -- keeping your coverage -- a 26-year-old keeping -- staying on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plan, a small business having --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about children with preexisting coverage?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, well, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is, the several immediate benefits that I outlined over the course of the past couple of days phase in at different points in the year 2010.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can an insurance company right now refuse to provide coverage for a child with preexisting condition?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, my understanding is that that -- this will phase in over a certain amount of time.\xc2\xa0 When that phases in, they will not be able to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When does that begin?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I said I would check on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just wanted to just follow up on one point about this Obama-Netanyahu communication.\xc2\xa0 You said -- first of all, you said there are ongoing conversations, and then later you said there are ongoing conversations between the President and the Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 So are we to take that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I said -- I may have been imprecise.\xc2\xa0 The Prime Minister, I believe, will meet with -- I believe he\xe2\x80\x99s going to meet with Senator Mitchell.\xc2\xa0 There may be other staff as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In town?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In town.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s staff and the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s staff met until I think around 12:30-ish last night and have continued to be in touch as part of that ongoing discussion today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you meant his staff -- you made a second reference.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, earlier I said that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule that involves a meeting with the Prime Minister at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you rule out a phone conversation between -- before the Prime Minister leaves?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not know that one has been requested, no.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, for Iowa tomorrow, we have the state attorney general challenges, as you mentioned earlier.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to talk about that tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 How will he handle that?\xc2\xa0 In his speech?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I got a draft of the remarks, but I have not had a chance to look at them.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he addresses those in the remarks, Roger, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this, that -- I think you saw the statement from the Department of Justice, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen lawsuits from several of these attorneys general, that we do not believe will be successful.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I assume Justice will be fighting those.\xc2\xa0 I understand some of the appeals were filed yesterday.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I saw many press conferences denoting that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another question.\xc2\xa0 The cofounder of Google says that he has asked the White House for help in this battle with China.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House offering any kind of help to Google?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on the co-founder\xe2\x80\x99s request.\xc2\xa0 I will check on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He says he wants the White House to elevate it, make it a human rights issue.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have -- if that\xe2\x80\x99s his request, I can tell you the President fulfilled that last November, as the Secretary of State has fulfilled in meetings also with the Chinese, saying that we believe free communication and a free Internet are rights that everyone should enjoy.\xc2\xa0 The President said that quite clearly in Shanghai last year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know of anything new, though, since then?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but I will check with NSC.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the envoy, Senator Mitchell, involved in the conversations here last night, the ones that went until 12:30 a.m.?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he was here last night.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s been part of this entire --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, you have repeatedly used the word \xe2\x80\x9cdiscussion.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is there something you\xe2\x80\x99re uncomfortable with in using the word \xe2\x80\x9cnegotiation\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Because most people would assume that if there is all this conversation, a negotiation might be taking place.\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t use that word.\xc2\xa0 So is it fair to assume, therefore, that this is something the administration is asking of the Israelis and until it fulfills there really isn\xe2\x80\x99t a negotiation, because some of the points are non-negotiable?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any strong allegiance to different words.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say, again, Major, that the President has asked the Prime Minister for certain things to build confidence leading up to proximity talks that we think can make progress.\xc2\xa0 These are discussions that are ongoing and, needless to say, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had many of these discussions for many months relating to different issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From the President\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, are the things requested non-negotiable?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the substance yet of the meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t even answer that, yes or no?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate you trying to pin me down on me saying I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to discuss the substance by putting me on one side of the ledger or not, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s actually not a substantive question -- it\xe2\x80\x99s about what the President has privately discussed with the Israelis and if they\xe2\x80\x99re non-negotiable from his point of view.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the substance.\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve now said that on camera about eight times.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are different variations to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the atmospherics of parsing, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is not a topic that\xe2\x80\x99s immune from parsing, as you well know.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m learning just in the last, say, 20 seconds.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Czechs have said that there is to be a signing ceremony in Prague on April 8th for the START treaty.\xc2\xa0 Is that premature?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve always discussed internally returning to the city the President outlined a speech in last year envisioning a world without nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 We believe that a new START treaty begins to take many important steps between the two greatest holders of those nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 So I would anticipate that when we have something to sign, it will be in Prague.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it premature to place that date for that event?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, as I said earlier, the President I think hopes to speak to the Russian leader in the next several days, but there\xe2\x80\x99s still some things that need to be worked out --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be the final conversation you would envision?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of what the conversation might be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 The Commerce Department reported today housing sales fell 2.2 percent last month, attributed in some large measure to the terrible weather, but also this is the fourth consecutive month that house sales have declined.\xc2\xa0 The homebuyers\xe2\x80\x99 tax credit is going to expire in the very near future.\xc2\xa0 To what degree is there a concern either here or the Commerce Department, the administration broadly, about this sector of the economy?\xc2\xa0 And what other ideas or proposals do you intend to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me check on the expiration of the current tax credit.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Vice President did an event earlier in the week demonstrating that tax returns will be bigger this year as a result of many of the tax credits in the Recovery Act as the homeowners\xe2\x80\x99 -- homebuyers\xe2\x80\x99 one being one of the bigger ones.</p>\n<p>Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that housing and real estate continue to be complicated problems for our economy.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to -- continue our modification program and to strengthen that program in order to keep as many people as possible in their houses, and to continue to work towards building an economy that has a stable foundation and we can see a turnaround in that.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s staff request a different coverage scheme for last night?\xc2\xa0 Did they ask for a picture taken between the Prime Minister and the President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t know, to be honest with you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What leverage is the United States, is the President bringing to bear on these discussions?\xc2\xa0 When you see, again, new housing in East Jerusalem today announced -- what is the leverage behind these talks?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I would say -- I would categorize the -- we have a strong partnership with a strong ally.\xc2\xa0 We share great concerns about Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security and we -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said here for probably the past almost two weeks, there\xe2\x80\x99s an unbreakable bond between the United States and the Israeli people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When they do so many wrong things.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve also said many times, there are areas in which we have agreements and areas in which we have disagreements.\xc2\xa0 Those were discussed last night between the President and the Prime Minister.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the question of U.S. aid to Israel been linked to these talks at all?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of, no.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Let me return to START real quickly -- Senator Kerry and Lugar meeting this morning -- did the President share language with those two senators?\xc2\xa0 Does he have language on verification and missile defense that he\xe2\x80\x99s convinced the Senate will actually ratify?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to -- I think we understand that ratification is what ultimately has to happen.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly mindful of that.\xc2\xa0 The President took the opportunity to update the chair and the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee on the status of our negotiations with the Russians on START.\xc2\xa0 Obviously they\xe2\x80\x99ll play a very big role in Senate ratification.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, this is -- the President and Senator Lugar have had a relationship on this issue that dates back, in all honesty, to about a week after he was elected to the Senate.\xc2\xa0 They had a phone conversation about the President joining the Foreign Relations Committee.\xc2\xa0 In that phone call the President, in 2004, asked Senator Lugar to be part of a trip to Russia that next year in 2005.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the two issues that I was asking about, though, is there language now that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we think we\xe2\x80\x99re getting quite close to an agreement, so I would say language and interpretation is certainly part of that ongoing process, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Then, briefly, if you will, on Iowa City tomorrow -- if this is such a great deal that the President has been talking about, why does he still need to sell it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, obviously the law that was signed yesterday will -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about here, there are some immediate benefits and then there are aspects that, as the President discussed yesterday, will be phased in over the next several years.</p>\n<p>I think the President believes it is important to continue to talk about the many aspects of the law that will do precisely what he said they\'re intended to do:\xc2\xa0 help small businesses that provide health coverage for their employees.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure there will be parents of those that attend the University of Iowa that will have some interest in keeping their children on a health insurance policy through the age of 26.\xc2\xa0 So I think there are many aspects of this that the President will talk about not only tomorrow in Iowa City, but I anticipate will spend some time talking about for, in all honesty, the next several years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I think you mentioned that the Presidents were expected to talk in the next couple of days, and then you said several days --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think I said the next few days.\xc2\xa0 I think I need like a -- can you guys make a real-time sort of -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s in the next few days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The next few days.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a schedule in front of me that would say which day that is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By Friday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to say -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say the next few days.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I won\xe2\x80\x99t guess on which day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back to START.\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize the Russians in their negotiating style for the past year or so, since this first commenced?\xc2\xa0 Would you characterize it as respectful and honest in candor?\xc2\xa0 And do you also, when this is signed, do you hope to use START as sort of a new sense of symbolism for other aspects of this important relationship?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that ever since the two leaders got together in London, I think last March or April, early April -- I forget the exact date -- we have been focused on a new type of dialogue and a partnership where the two countries can address the issues that -- the issues of mutual agreement.\xc2\xa0 We have worked with them on our next steps on Iran.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with them in different avenues relating to North Korea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve said several times that we wanted to get this treaty right.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure their perspective would be the same.\xc2\xa0 But we wanted to get this treaty right for the United States of America. It\xe2\x80\x99s taken a little extra time for us to get that.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President believes we\xe2\x80\x99re close.\xc2\xa0 And I would say this:\xc2\xa0 The President has been deeply involved personally in moving this process forward and along throughout that process, speaking directly, again, with -- on March 13th, in order to move this process even further along.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following on that, does the President think there\xe2\x80\x99s been a risk having let the treaty lapse at the end of last year? Does he have any guarantees that the Russians haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken advantage of this period of --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some more detailed guidance from NSC on any type of bridging agreements that have been had.\xc2\xa0 But I think we have -- I think both sides have negotiated in good faith.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the President think that the -- describe again the endpoint of this new treaty, what the President wants and has held out for in this new version of START.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- because we have not finished negotiations, I would prefer not to read out where we are on some of the individual aspects of this.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity, no doubt, to do that in the next several days pending an agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he wants reductions in both sides?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, absolutely -- no, absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eventually leading to no nuclear weapons in, what, a century or a lifetime?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think he said in Prague that he may not live to see this day.\xc2\xa0 But former Secretary of State George Shultz, former Senator Sam Nunn, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger are some of the people that the President has spoken fairly regularly to and share the same goal he does of eliminating nuclear weapons from our planet and the risk that -- which will be a great focus of the President\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear security summit in April -- in securing quickly loose nuclear material throughout the world to prevent that material from falling into the hands of terrorists.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how confident are you that the agreement will be signed before the nuclear summit?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re very close.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 The deficit savings outlined in the health care bill obviously depend on a series of future actions such as the Cadillac tax going into effect or doctor payments remaining unchanged, for example.\xc2\xa0 And even the CBO has said that Congress rarely follows through on those sorts of fiscal restraint promises.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, does the President plan to veto any bills that would undermine or reduce those cost savings?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to -- a broader point, it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting the degree to which people either lean on or lean away from CBO based on whether they believe CBO has proved or not proved their point.\xc2\xa0 Setting that aside, the President is confident in what he signed will come to fruition and that we\xe2\x80\x99ll take actions to ensure that that happens.\xc2\xa0 I think many of the team believe that cost saving that CBO can\xe2\x80\x99t look into will actually exceed what has been outlined, as is often the case with legislation that they look at.</p>\n<p>So the President is confident that we will be on a path toward meeting the more than $1 trillion in deficit savings that the Congressional Budget Office says will happen as a result of the President\xe2\x80\x99s signature over the course of the next two decades.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to stand up for it in case -- you know, if Congress does come to him either now or in the future with a bill that would reduce any of those cost savings, it sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President throughout these negotiations was clear even when others either inside or outside of government did not want to be part of cost reductions as part of health care reform.\xc2\xa0 So the President is very focused on ensuring that what he\xe2\x80\x99s outlined comes to fruition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many of the Democrats -- of the 219 Democrats who voted for \xe2\x80\x9cObamacare\xe2\x80\x9d have invited the President to campaign for them in their districts this fall?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a political schedule in front of me, Lester.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since not one of the Republicans in the House voted for \xe2\x80\x9cObamacare,\xe2\x80\x9d and 32 Democrats voted against --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you mean -- I\'m sorry, I\'m confused.\xc2\xa0 Do you mean by that the law that the President signed yesterday?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cObamacare,\xe2\x80\x9d yes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, I just was -- I didn\'t know if that was the Internet vernacular or the name of the bill, Lester.\xc2\xa0 I was a little confused.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s all right.\xc2\xa0 Since not one of the Republicans in the House voted for this and 32 Democrats voted against it --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thirty-four.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- 34, and it won by only --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- seven votes, how can you deny that this is a pyrrhic victory?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Trick question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I was going to say, Lester, I\'m a simple man, but I could not really -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You know what pyrrhic victory is, don\'t you?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 I have -- I\'m going to have -- I\'m not doing this on purpose -- I\'m going to have Pete print me a very nice picture that shows the President\xe2\x80\x99s signature on a law yesterday that will benefit the lives of millions of people in this country for many, many years to come.\xc2\xa0 I will let anybody decide what they\xe2\x80\x99d like to call that victory.\xc2\xa0 The President believes it was a substantial victory for the safety and security of the American people in knowing that their station in life is not now determined by their access to health care.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much for your answer, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that very much.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Vice President -- do you know if Vice President Biden is standing by to go up to Capitol Hill in case that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is.\xc2\xa0 He is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you expect that he might have to go up there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If needed, he is ready to go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am actually enormously shocked that it took us that actual amount of time for -- (laughter) -- I lost the pool, guys.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The money is back on my desk.\xc2\xa0 I knew that -- I know that these guys in the front row had to ask all these -- whoo! -- foreign policy questions and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- (laughter) -- but I know that each one of them -- yes, they\xe2\x80\x99re all laughing, I know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two of them asked 13 questions apiece, 13.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And explicable, Lester, in that 26 we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get one of those jokes.\xc2\xa0 A pyrrhic victory -- right.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, David, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- or Bill, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, has the President said anything to Biden about that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Republican mantra today is \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t retreat, repeal\xe2\x80\x9d the bill that the President signed yesterday.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s response to this \xe2\x80\x9crepeal\xe2\x80\x9d campaign?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is -- I think I got a similar question the other day, and I will say the same thing I said.\xc2\xa0 If the message that Republicans want to take into a midterm election or in a presidential campaign in 2012 is \xe2\x80\x9cwe want to take tax cuts away from small businesses\xe2\x80\x9d; that they get help in providing health care to their employees; if they\xe2\x80\x99d like to campaign actively on taking help from seniors that fall into the doughnut hole as part of the prescription drug benefit; and if they\xe2\x80\x99d like to take away the safety and security that that mother feels in knowing that the insurance that she pays premiums to each and every month can\xe2\x80\x99t tell her that her child has a preexisting condition -- if that\xe2\x80\x99s the platform they want to run on, that would -- that sounds like a heck of a good time.</p>\n<p>David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 In 2007, during the campaign, the President said that he does not support the Hyde Amendment and the federal government should not intrude onto a poor woman\xe2\x80\x99s decision whether to carry to term or terminate her pregnancy.\xc2\xa0 So my question today is, as he signs this executive order, which will further enshrine the Hyde Amendment, how does he feel about that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 David, I would have to see what -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the comment that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He was opposed to the Hyde Amendment.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was in a questionnaire, a pro-choice questionnaire.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was in a questionnaire --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll have somebody -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- you can just assume I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at a questionnaire in quite some time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you stipulate that he opposed the Hyde Amendment, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would stipulate that the President believes in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose.</p>\n<p>Glen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said with a great deal of confidence that you believe that the health reform act will be able to withstand these legal challenges -- Cuccinelli, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 What is -- specifically, can you sort of give us an idea of what\xe2\x80\x99s the basis of your confidence?\xc2\xa0 Have you gotten anything from Holder or the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the statement that Justice put out yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this -- the argument of constitutionality was one that was brought up during the debate, but I think the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office here, the Department of Justice, and, quite frankly, legal experts throughout the country believe that the right -- that the law does not -- the law is not unconstitutional based on what these attorneys general are suing for.\xc2\xa0 The notion that -- we believe the President and the federal government does have the ability through the interstate commerce clause to ensure health care.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mean, I -- this was an article today quoting a law professor from Stanford.\xc2\xa0 It says:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be surprising if the Supreme Court says Congress can\xe2\x80\x99t regulate people who are participating in the $1 trillion health care market,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Freeman Engstrom, a Stanford University Law School professor.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThe lawsuit probably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have legs both as a matter of precedent and as a matter of common sense.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re aware, there have been sort of counterarguments and talks about sort of disaggregating various parts, including the individual mandate.\xc2\xa0 Can you provide us, in the interests of transparency, with some of the memos that have been provided to the administration in terms of justifying the legal foundation for your --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to go back and see whether there\xe2\x80\x99s been anything formal that\xe2\x80\x99s been prepared on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on this, please, for one second?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 One more and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Governor McDonnell in Virginia is signing legislation today to void -- in a sense void his state from having to participate in the health care reforms, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 In a broader sense, though, this is the first piece of legislation perhaps since the civil rights movement that so many states have lined up against.\xc2\xa0 Is there some way of making an analogy on there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which attorneys -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which attorneys general in the 1960s were running for higher office, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I could draw the direct analogy that I\xe2\x80\x99d like to draw.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n1:32 P.M.
