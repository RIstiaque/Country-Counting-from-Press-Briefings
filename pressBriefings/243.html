Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:55 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Let me start today by briefly noting that legislators in South Carolina came together in bipartisan fashion to vote overwhelmingly to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the state capitol.\xc2\xa0 I understand that Governor Haley will sign that bill into law later today.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s good news and that\xe2\x80\x99s progress.</p>\n<p>\n\tRepublicans in Congress, however, seem to have values and priorities that lie elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 Right now, the Interior appropriations bill in the House is jammed up because a sizeable number of House Republicans are eager to protect the status of the Confederate flag on National Park Service grounds.\xc2\xa0 These are the same House Republicans who voted for a party leader who once described himself as \xe2\x80\x9cDavid Duke without the baggage.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 These are same congressional Republicans who have declined to criticize the race-baiting rhetoric of a leading Republican presidential candidate.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s to say nothing of the Senate Republican who saluted that candidate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo when you hear me say that congressional Republicans have an agenda that is out of step with the vast majority of Americans, his record, at least in part, is what I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, Jim, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you get us started?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Well, on that subject, one of the issues that\xe2\x80\x99s holding up that Interior bill is a vote that initially they were going to have vote today, but they put it off to change some provisions that were in that Interior bill.\xc2\xa0 But it does go to some policies that the administration can have some effect on.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the administration has any interest in changing current Park Service policy that permits the display of Confederate flags in cemeteries, federal cemeteries.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know that the National Park Service has talked about some of the policy changes that they have made in the last couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have those in front of me, but I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That one I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe was affected by it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we can check on that for you.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are a number of announcements that they made that were related to the sale of Confederate flag objects in gift shops and those kinds of things.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll walk through the -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you a list of those details.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there are a number of changes that the National Park Service has made, and we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly supportive of the amendments that were passed by voice vote in the House of Representatives on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s precisely those amendments that would limit the display of the Confederate flag on National Park Service grounds that Republicans are trying to reverse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you could do that through executive action, why not just take care of it that way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, like I said, I think there are a number of policy changes that are related to this that the National Park Service has already announced, and we can give you a list of those.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So as we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for Secretary Kerry to give us an update from Vienna, I wondered if you maybe cared to preempt them and just --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just tell us.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely not going to do that.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that Secretary Kerry will later this afternoon, East Coast time, offer an update on the status of the talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it does look like negotiators are going to bust through the latest deadline, which would essentially give Congress an extra 30 days, if there were a deal, for them to review it.\xc2\xa0 Do you all think that if there is a deal, that August presents you with a better opportunity to sell the public on this, or does it present opponents with a better opportunity to make a case against it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there will be critics of the deal who will say that they would like to have additional time to try and criticize the agreement.\xc2\xa0 That said, we continue to have confidence that the terms of the political agreement that were reached in Lausanne will be the parameters of a final agreement, if one can be reached in Vienna.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is that\xe2\x80\x99s essentially what the President has established as his bottom line, and the President continues to be confident that an agreement like that would effectively shut down every pathway that Iran has to a nuclear weapon, and it would put in place the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program to verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, this final agreement has not been reached yet; there still continue to be some obstacles to reaching that final agreement.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s the only kind of final agreement that President Obama and the American negotiating team will sign off on.\xc2\xa0 The good news is that this is the only kind of final agreement that our international partners will sign off on as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President has succeeded over the last several years in building a unanimous international front to compel Iran to come to the negotiating table and to make serious commitments and concessions that will ensure that any sort of nuclear activity that exists in Iran exists solely for peaceful purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the issues that has appeared lately is Iran\xe2\x80\x99s demand for lifting the U.N. arms embargo.\xc2\xa0 Is that out of the question as far as the Obama administration is concerned?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the details of what\xe2\x80\x99s currently being negotiated by the United States and our P5+1 partners and the Iranians.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just as a matter of policy, is that something that the administration -- that that\xe2\x80\x99s strictly not part of the equation?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the Iranians have sought, and what is the essence of the negotiation, are how would the Iranians take specific steps to shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon, and, in exchange, would nuclear sanctions -- nuclear weapons-related sanctions be relieved in exchange for those steps.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we have said is that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to see concrete, verifiable progress toward living up to their commitments on the part of the Iranians before sanctions relief related to nuclear weapons is given.\xc2\xa0 But exactly how to structure that is the essence of the ongoing negotiations in Vienna.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, got anything new on Greece?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to leave it at that then.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There we go.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s cut to the chase.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I like that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the highway bill, is the White House open to using the repatriation of tax dollars from appropriations moving overseas to pay for the highway bill, as Chairman Ryan has suggested?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, what we have indicated is we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward our own plan that does involve some tax reforms that would essentially close loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected, and use the revenue from those changes to make investments in infrastructure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat Chairman Ryan has proposed is slightly different than that.\xc2\xa0 But what we have observed and I think others have observed is Chairman Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s proposal may indicate an openness to the kind of principle that we have embraced about tax reform proposals that would yield revenue that could be used to invest in infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 The nature of closing those loopholes is, again, the subject of some difference of opinion, I think, and that would be part of any negotiation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have indicated that this could be a fruitful path for making the kinds of badly needed investments in our infrastructure that would have a positive impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to find some common ground with Republicans in those conversations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you open to doing another short-term deal or getting a longer one sealed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, we\xe2\x80\x99ve raised significant concerns about the frequency with which Congress chooses to just kick the can down the road when it comes to funding our infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 And that does inhibit the ability of state officials, certainly, but others who are responsible for managing the critical infrastructure of the United States, to plan effectively.\xc2\xa0 When we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about large infrastructure projects, these are projects that take years to complete, particularly when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the planning, engineering and architecture of these programs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so to fund these efforts at a month or two or three at a time is really inefficient.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not willing to make a public declaration one way or the other right now, other than at some point Congress needs to get serious about making a long-term commitment to investing in our country\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure, both because of how important that is to the country over the long term, but because of the important economic benefits that could be associated with such an investment in the short term.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s not a yes or a no?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is a -- I think it is a we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what emerges from Congress with a bias toward a longer-term commitment that we believe is consistent with the best interests of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, General Dunford said at his confirmation hearing today that Russia presents the greatest national security threat to the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Is that an assessment that the White House shares?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\'t seen a formal assessment from the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team.\xc2\xa0 Given the amount of time that we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent talking about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities in Ukraine, I think should give you some indication that we\xe2\x80\x99re very mindful of the kind of risk associated with Russian activity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a little bit in here about some of the same saber-rattling that the Russians have engaged in.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve taken some provocative steps near the border of some of our NATO allies that we\xe2\x80\x99ve raised concerns about previously.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of the threat from Russia, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear the commitment that the United States is willing to make when it comes to backing up our NATO allies who might be on -- who are certainly on the front lines of these tensions.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, Jeff, it\xe2\x80\x99s also clear that we have been, in some areas, been able to effectively coordinate with the Russians to advance the interest of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And the best and most vivid example of that that I can give you is that Russian negotiators have been active and constructive participants in Vienna, sitting on the same side of the table as the United States, as we compel Iran to take the steps to shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President did sort of mock his rival in 2012, Mitt Romney, for saying that Russia was the greatest threat to the U.S. national security.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m just curious what he thinks about this person who he has chosen to be the next Joint Chiefs of Staff saying the same thing today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, since that time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the kind of activity from Russia that makes their activities somewhat more concerning:\xc2\xa0 Their destabilizing activities in Ukraine, some of the stepped-up saber-rattling that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from them both as it relates to their nuclear program but also as it relates to some of their military activities near the borders of our NATO allies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that these kinds of assessments are dynamic based on the activity and the situation on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But again, certainly General Dunford is somebody who has spent a lot of time thinking about these issues and has his own view.\xc2\xa0 But I think he would be the first to admit that that reflects his own view and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily reflect the view of -- or the consensus -- analysis of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that American workers need to work longer hours and harder to improve the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I can tell you that the President believes that the data indicates very clearly that the American people are working very hard, and by some measures working harder than ever.\xc2\xa0 What we have unfortunately not seen is that hard work be fairly rewarded with an increase in wages; that we are seeing American workers work harder, that they\xe2\x80\x99re being more productive but we\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing those wages raised at a corresponding rate.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has made it a policy priority to try to find ways to make sure that American workers are getting paid fairly.\xc2\xa0 So one way we can do that is to raise the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 A number of states have taken that step, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen even some private sector companies take that step when it comes to compensating their employees.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that workers who are working full time, trying to raise a family of four at the minimum wage, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be trying to raise the family below the poverty line, but yet that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing right now.\xc2\xa0 So the President believes that American workers deserve a raise.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust last week, the President announced that the hardest-working Americans should deserve fair pay if they\xe2\x80\x99re working overtime.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President announced a rule change that could potentially allow 5 million Americans to get a raise when they work overtime.\xc2\xa0 That is consistent with the priority that the President has placed on trying to make sure that Americans can get a fair paycheck.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that by just about any measure that American workers are working harder than ever.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is Jeb Bush on to something when he does say that the American economy depends too much on part-time workers, and that they need to be full-time, and that there are too many people who are underemployed in this country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is no doubt that the President is very focused on trying to expand economic opportunity for everybody in this country.\xc2\xa0 We can get you the updated data on this, but what our economists have told us is that if you take a look at the job growth that this country has experienced over the last four or five years in the aftermath of the Great Recession, that the vast majority of the jobs that were created -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking on the order of 80 or 90 percent -- were actually full-time jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that our economy is moving in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve long indicated that we would like to see more policies be put in place here in Washington, D.C. that would create more jobs, that would create more good-paying jobs, and that would allow those Americans who are currently working really hard to be paid fairly.\xc2\xa0 And whether that means giving minimum-wage workers a raise, or ensuring that more Americans who do work overtime can be properly compensated for their extra work.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just briefly on Iran, kind of a housekeeping thing.\xc2\xa0 There was a message today that there would be a joint news conference -- a news conference here and a news conference in Iran -- if and when a deal is announced.\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate?\xc2\xa0 And is that a signal that things are closer than we have been told?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 When you say \xe2\x80\x9chere,\xe2\x80\x9d you mean?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the United States by this President and then in Iran by their leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not aware of any sort of planning that is actively being coordinated between the United States and Iran as it relates to the logistics of announcing an agreement.\xc2\xa0 Right now, we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on trying to reach an agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot.\xc2\xa0 I\'m curious, from what you know, has the President and the Vice President, have they had any discussions about the possibility of the Vice President joining the 2016 presidential race?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President and Vice President speak frequently, including having a regularly weekly lunch.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the details of any of those conversations to share with you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What would, in your view, the Vice President add to the equation if he were to decide to join the 2016 race?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the fact that the President chose Joe Biden to be his Vice President -- a decision that the President has often described as the best political decision he\xe2\x80\x99s ever made -- I think is all of the indication that you need about what a good president President Obama thinks Joe Biden would make.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s almost an endorsement.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not really.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to ask you about your opening statement about the Confederate flag.\xc2\xa0 And you even diverted a little bit into the presidential contender who is making some divisive comments about immigration.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a leading Republican presidential candidate who has said some of those things.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wow.\xc2\xa0 Compared to yesterday, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even want to talk about it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Difference in days.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, how about that.\xc2\xa0 So with that, and understanding that you wrote this in conversation and consultation with people around White House, what did the President talk to you about within the last 24 hours about this issue, himself?\xc2\xa0 What has he said?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to the President about this issue in the last 24 hours.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About the Confederate flag, or about Mr. Trump?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, when it comes to the issue of Trump -- and I\'m going to pose the question that I asked you yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Reince Priebus two weeks ago told me that this nation is more united than it is divided.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing that he has tried to wrangle Trump -- he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to bring him in.\xc2\xa0 Do you think it is time for someone to talk to many of these candidates to stop the divisive conversations, because we are nation that\xe2\x80\x99s browning and a nation that is going to be majority minority in decades to come?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think each of these candidates is going to have to make their own decision about the kinds of values and priorities that they articulate, what kind of agenda they want to pursue.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be up to each of them.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s part of what makes our free country so great.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, how much will the President lean in on this issue?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you gave a strong statement at the opening of this briefing.\xc2\xa0 If indeed there is an effort to -- a successful effort to reverse the amendment on the Hill by the GOP, will the President lean in on this issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President will have the occasion to talk about this in the days and weeks ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will this be something he may talk about at the NAACP convention Tuesday when he speaks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility of that, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how confident is the administration that it now has a handle on the hacking?\xc2\xa0 Do you know who did it?\xc2\xa0 Are you willing to say?\xc2\xa0 And what are you going to do about it?\xc2\xa0 And what can you do about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point, Bill, our investigators are continuing to work on this.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned to your colleague yesterday, I would anticipate that there would be additional information made available soon about what we know about some of the cyber breaches that have been experienced over at the Office of Personnel Management.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Give us a little preview.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m going to reserve judgment on doing that because any announcements that we have about new information that has been obtained and new conclusions that have been reached will be disseminated by OPM.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you still think it\xe2\x80\x99s the Chinese who are responsible?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know that there are some who speculated on who may be responsible at this point.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not willing to do that.\xc2\xa0 But I will note that there have been other incidents of inappropriate cyber activity that we have attributed to the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 We have freely acknowledged that just about every time the President meets with his counterpart, and when other U.S. officials meet with their Chinese counterparts, that the issue of China\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in cyberspace is one that we routinely raise.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the big question is, what is the United States government going to be able to do to fix this?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on those kinds of steps soon.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of things that we have proposed, and that includes some specific pieces of legislation that we have sent to Capitol Hill but that have not yet been passed.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed significant concern about in the past.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a concern that we continue to hold.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a number of other steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken using the President\xe2\x80\x99s own authority to try to both strengthen cyber defenses of the federal government, but also make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got more tools that we can use to respond to threats in cyberspace.\xc2\xa0 And this is everything from convening a cybersecurity summit with public and private sector experts out in California back in February to discuss this issue.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President did.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd earlier this spring, we announced that the President had delegated authority to the Secretary of Treasury that would allow the United States government to impose financial sanctions against individuals or entities that are engaged in cyber hacking or benefit from cyber hacking.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly puts more tools in the President\xe2\x80\x99s toolbox as he considers what steps can be taken to respond to either this incident or others that may emerge.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a related issue, there was a quote from a government official today -- yesterday perhaps -- which suggested that the government would not insist that technology companies provide a backdoor key to encryption; that they would only encourage it.\xc2\xa0 Is this the U.S. position?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is currently an effort underway to work with private sector technology companies to resolve many of the concerns that we\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed about encryption technology.\xc2\xa0 We have seen that some individuals who are seeking to carry out acts of violence are trying to evade detection using this encryption technology.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the President has spoken forcefully about the need for robust encryption technology that protects the safety of citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would you try to mandate it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s no policy conclusion that\xe2\x80\x99s been reached on this, but the President has acknowledged the importance of a robust encryption capability that would allow private sector companies to ensure that their customers and others who are using their online tools can do so with the confidence of some privacy.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time -- and again, I think that even many in the technology industry would acknowledge that they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to allow individuals who are attempting to carry out acts of violence to use their technology to make them more successful in doing that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a difficult policy problem and one that the administration and certainly our law enforcement professionals inside the administration are working on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the suggestion was from this official that the government would not try to mandate it.\xc2\xa0 Is that your understanding?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware that any conclusion like that has been reached at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just coming back a couple days ago when you were asked about whether the President had accepted Nguyen Phu Trong\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to visit Vietnam in their bilateral meeting.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the Communist leader spoke at a think-tank and he reiterated that the President had accepted his invitation.\xc2\xa0 Can you be a little bit more clear -- is the White House considering a stop in Vietnam for the President this year, and particularly on the Asia trip?\xc2\xa0 Is that under consideration actively?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 David, at this point, the President is planning to travel to Asia this fall as he traditionally has done while in office.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of multilateral meetings that are convened in Asia in the fall.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s itinerary at this point, but as soon as we have more information about his trip we can follow up with you on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there reasons that you would not want the President to travel to Vietnam?\xc2\xa0 That they may not be ready for a visit?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s chosen to travel previously to Burma or Malaysia, other countries with records of the same kind of human rights issues that Vietnam has.\xc2\xa0 Is there something about Vietnam that the administration is concerned about, about giving that kind of attention to the presidential trip?\xc2\xa0 Or does it just happen to be coincidental that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to stop there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say that the administration has been outspoken in raising some concerns about the government of Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s human rights record, and these were concerns that the President made directly with the General Secretary when he was here at the White House earlier this week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as it relates to the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel, I just don\'t have any details on his Asia itinerary yet at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would a trip to Vietnam be predicated on progress on TPP and certain steps that Vietnam promises to take either on opening their economy or improving their human rights record?\xc2\xa0 Is that how you decide -- can you talk a little bit about how you would decide whether to go?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a range of factors that would go into making a decision about travel to Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously have a lot of business that we\'re trying to do there, and certainly an important part of that business is trying to complete the TPP agreement.\xc2\xa0 But, again, there are a lot of factors that go into any sort of presidential trip, particularly an international one, and so I wouldn\'t pin a decision on the President\xe2\x80\x99s itinerary to one specific policy issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 While we\'ve been in here, Secretary Kerry came out and talked to reporters in Vienna and said basically that they won\'t be rushed; they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to negotiate forever, but they\xe2\x80\x99re going to stay at the table for now.\xc2\xa0 So I guess my question for you is, as the President sees it, is there any time pressure here?\xc2\xa0 And when you say -- you said a couple days ago that negotiators would stay at the table until it was no longer useful to do so.\xc2\xa0 Could you lay out for us what that exactly means?\xc2\xa0 What are the sort of factors that you\'re looking at when the President decides it would be useful for them to stay at the table or not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a difficult thing to talk about without getting into the details of the discussions, but let me give it a try.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what I would just say generally is that Secretary Kerry himself has observed -- and I don\'t know if he reiterated this view today -- I think he might have -- that it is true that over the last couple of weeks negotiators have made important progress.\xc2\xa0 And they previously described that progress as the closest they\xe2\x80\x99d ever been to reaching a final agreement.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, Secretary Kerry has acknowledged that there still remains significant obstacles to a final agreement.\xc2\xa0 And I think what the President and the negotiating team are looking for is a genuine commitment on the part of everybody sitting around the table, including both the Iranians and our P5+1 partners, to trying to constructively resolve the remaining sticking points.\xc2\xa0 And as long as there is tangible evidence that there is a constructive effort underway, then the talks will continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does Iran bringing up new issues at the negotiating table, would that prompt U.S. negotiators at this point to walk away?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that seen as a sign that they\xe2\x80\x99re not really serious about, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times, implementing the framework that was agreed upon earlier this year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'m not aware that any last-minute -- I\'m not aware of a last-minute introduction of any new details, necessarily.\xc2\xa0 But even if that did occur, I probably wouldn\'t talk about it from here just because we\'re trying to protect the ability of the negotiators to have their conversations in private until we\'re ready to announce an agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a housing rule that was announced yesterday, I know the President has spoken after Ferguson and Baltimore and some of these racially sort of tinged incidents in cities around the country about a need to do more across government domestically to really address the root causes here.\xc2\xa0 Does he see that as part of that effort?\xc2\xa0 And are we going to see more, sort of, of the rulemaking and policy initiatives that may have been in the pipeline for a long time coming to the fore now to try to round out some of that agenda he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about to address racial disparities?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any announcements in mind when I say this, but I think you can expect that the President and his administration are going to continue to place a priority on advancing policies that will expand economic opportunity for every American.\xc2\xa0 And the step -- or the rule that was announced by the Department of Housing and Urban Development is an example of the kind of rule that will make it more likely that every American has access to quality, affordable housing in this country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there has been some interesting academic data to indicate that children that are raised in certain neighborhoods don\'t have access to the same kind of economic opportunity that children in other neighborhoods do.\xc2\xa0 And trying to make sure that every child has access to that kind of opportunity is a priority of the administration.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly was part of the thinking behind advancing the housing rule, and I\'m confident that that priority will influence additional decisions and announcements made by the administration over the next 18 months or so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question there about the progress in the Iran talks, the President was quoted as saying that the odds were less than 50/50 by Senator Durbin, who was at that working reception the other night.\xc2\xa0 Is that essentially where things stand right now, a little less than 50/50?\xc2\xa0 That sounds a little more pessimistic than the way it was assessed earlier.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would caution against reading too much into the secondhand communication of what the President said in the working reception.\xc2\xa0 The President has previously described the odds of talks sort of along the way as being around 50/50, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an illustration --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Forty-nine percent.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an illustration that, look, we are in a place where this could go either way.\xc2\xa0 Either Iran will live up to the political commitments that were reached in Switzerland back in April and sign onto the dotted line of a final agreement, a detailed agreement that reflects the parameters of that commitment that would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, or they won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And it will require Iran to make some very serious commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99d previously been unwilling to consider.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so you can understand why there may be some who are sitting on the Iranian side of the table that are reluctant to do that.\xc2\xa0 This is a tough deal.\xc2\xa0 But this is also the unanimous view of the international community.\xc2\xa0 And that is why this is a tough decision for the Iranians to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it sounds like Secretary Kerry, when he was saying that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to negotiate forever, that there is going to be sort of an end of the road here one way or the other.\xc2\xa0 Would the White House be open to -- if they just can\xe2\x80\x99t get to an agreement over the next several days -- coming back in a few weeks and trying again?\xc2\xa0 Or have you sort of done that a little too much now and you\xe2\x80\x99re sort of at this point where you feel like, hey, this is it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about possible resolutions here.\xc2\xa0 What our negotiators are focused on is engaging in constructive talks to try to resolve the remaining sticking points.\xc2\xa0 And whether that\xe2\x80\x99s possible still remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And getting back to Donald Trump -- if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, you referenced him twice without naming him.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a rule here against naming Donald Trump here --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not a rule that you have.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Are you trying to say -- the opening statement that you made was pretty harsh.\xc2\xa0 Are you trying to say that the Republican Party has a problem with race?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that the American people will judge the record of congressional Republicans based on their actions, based on the positions that they advocate on the floor of the United States Congress, and based on the way that they discuss these issues.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how it should be.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, this will be up to the American people to consider and evaluate.\xc2\xa0 I would say there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the stark difference in the agenda that\xe2\x80\x99s advanced by Republicans with regard to many of these issues and the priorities and values that are espoused by Democrats.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because you have a Republican governor in South Carolina who has advocated for taking down the Confederate flag at her state capitol, and the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, said today that he\xe2\x80\x99s not in favor of having Confederate flags at federal cemeteries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t include that in your opening remarks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I did include a reference to Governor Haley\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Governor Haley, but not what Speaker Boehner --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s notable that Speaker Boehner is having some difficulty in persuading the remaining -- the other members of his conference of his view.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the American people themselves will consider as they evaluate the agenda that\xe2\x80\x99s being advanced by Republicans in Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s been some talk about whether the statue of Jefferson Davis should be removed from the Capitol.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a view on that?\xc2\xa0 Should all Confederate reminders be just removed from federal buildings?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that Speaker Boehner obliquely referred to that in his news conference today, and obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the House of Representatives to decide what\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate to be on display in the building where they conduct the people\xe2\x80\x99s work.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to Donald Trump -- I remember during the 2008 campaign, the President used a phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe silly season.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He described when things would get a little heated out on the campaign trails being the midst of \xe2\x80\x9cthe silly season\xe2\x80\x9d of politics.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that what\xe2\x80\x99s happening right now with Donald Trump is more than that; that this is not just sort of early presidential election campaign silliness and media fascinations and that sort of thing?\xc2\xa0 When you say that the Republican Party hasn\xe2\x80\x99t condemned Donald Trump and describe him as the leading Republican presidential candidate, you are trying to sort of hang the entire Republican Party, or hang Donald Trump around the entire Republican Party.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that the positions and statements of Republicans is one that the American people will evaluate and eventually pass judgment on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as for what Donald Trump said about Mexican immigrants, your view on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I have resisted commenting on his occasionally outrageous claims.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You went after him but you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to elaborate I guess is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve probably said enough on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tBob.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not exactly sure what Secretary Kerry has just said, but you put out a statement last night about the teleconference with the President and the negotiating team, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 The impression we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten though is that Kerry has had -- Kerry and the team have had significant leeway in these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 This is a simple question:\xc2\xa0 Was the President briefed today in any greater length, or did he talk with Kerry at any greater length?\xc2\xa0 Did he need to be updated, considering what went on yesterday?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, for what Secretary Kerry said today, we can certainly get you a transcript of his remarks.\xc2\xa0 More generally, the President did consult with the negotiating team in Vienna last evening, and this was a conversation that lasted about an hour and a half.\xc2\xa0 The President talked to them via secure video teleconference.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this was an opportunity for the President to merely check in with the negotiating team.\xc2\xa0 The President has been regularly updated, I think I mentioned this the other day, on average more than once a day about the status of the ongoing talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think it is fair to say that President Obama has a lot of confidence in Secretary Kerry, Secretary Moniz, Ambassador Wendy Sherman, and the other senior members of the negotiating team to represent the interests of the United States and ensure that they are advocating consistent with the strategy that the President has laid out.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, yes, the President has a lot of confidence in their ability to conduct these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, I would also say, observe, that the President has been crystal-clear about what his criteria is for a final agreement.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been very direct both in public but also in private, in the context of meetings just like this, about the fact that if Iran is not willing to take all the necessary steps to shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon and to cooperate with the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, then there won\xe2\x80\x99t be an agreement.\xc2\xa0 The President won\xe2\x80\x99t authorize Secretary Kerry and Secretary Moniz to sign onto a final agreement, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident we won\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about Secretary Kerry and Secretary Moniz signing off on an agreement that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t accomplish the goal that the President has clearly laid out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I guess the point of the question was, was there a need to update the President today significantly if things have changed since the teleconference?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a significant change since the conversation that they had last evening.\xc2\xa0 I do think that the President was updated this morning on the status of the talks.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how robust that update was, given he had talked about it for an hour and a half the night before.</p>\n<p>\n\tToluse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Following up on Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question, do you see any upside or benefit to extending the 30-day period to 60 days?\xc2\xa0 Does the White House see any positive side of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I guess what we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- our view of this is that it\xe2\x80\x99s immaterial; that if an agreement can be reached, we will be confident in making the case to the American public and to the world that this agreement would effectively prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and is, in fact, the best possible way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon; that reaching a diplomatic agreement along the lines of the one that we have described that is backed up by strict verification measures to ensure Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the agreement is a better way to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon than all of the others that are contemplated.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t other options; we\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated that those other options remain on the table.\xc2\xa0 But this continues to be the best way for us to accomplish that critical national security goal, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that we will pursue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the U.N. arms embargo, apparently Iran is pushing to have that lifted.\xc2\xa0 Russia seems to also want to sell arms to Iran.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you fear there being a non-nuclear arms race in the region with Israel and other regional actors wanting to beef up their arms as well to counter anything that Iran may be doing after the U.N. arms embargo.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the substance of the discussions, but I will -- let me say a couple of things to address that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first is the Obama administration I think has made it quite clear to everybody in the region and even around the world of our commitment to standing shoulder to shoulder with Israel when it comes to their unique security needs.\xc2\xa0 And there is significant security assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s been provided by the United States at the direction of President Obama.\xc2\xa0 That security cooperation continues to this day, and it is a security relationship that has not wavered.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ll also recall that about six weeks ago the President convened a group of GCC countries at Camp David.\xc2\xa0 And part of that discussion was focused on how to strengthen the security relationship between those countries and the United States, and among those countries themselves; how could the United States facilitate stronger security relationships among those countries.\xc2\xa0 And that conversation reflects the volatile region of the world in which those countries are located.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the United States certainly values those important relationships.\xc2\xa0 Some of those relationships with GCC countries have been important to advancing our national security interests in the region and around the world.\xc2\xa0 And strengthening those relationships is an important priority, but one way that we can strengthen those relationships is to facilitate the ability of those countries to work together to better provide for their own security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd all of those efforts are ongoing, mindful of the destabilizing impact that Iran will continue to exercise in the Middle East even if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reach a final agreement about their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one more on the Americans who are held in Iran.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said that\xe2\x80\x99s not really the principal focus of these talks, but you said on the sidelines that some of that is going on.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the extra time, the additional delays have provided any opportunities for maybe having an announcement that includes the release of any of those individuals, or whether or not you\xe2\x80\x99re sort of foreclosing that as an option of announcing those things at the same time.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on the status of our efforts to secure the release of some American citizens that we believe are unjustly detained in Iran.\xc2\xa0 I will tell you that we continue to make a forceful case to the Iranians that they should be released, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 And that takes place sometimes on the sidelines of the ongoing international nuclear negotiations, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter that\xe2\x80\x99s kept separate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to great lengths to make sure that the status of these individuals doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get overly wrapped up in the efforts to resolve the nuclear situation there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99d be able to tell the families that there would be a better opportunity aside from this extended period of face-to-face talks at a high level to get their family members back in the future, if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t done now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that remains to be seen.\xc2\xa0 But what we will continue to do in the event of a deal or even in the event of no deal being agreed to, we\'re going to continue to advocate for the release of these Americans that we believe are unjustly being detained in Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to try to pin you down a little bit on highway funding.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the Transportation Secretary said that there is a need to break the cycle of these short-term extensions and that he might recommend that the President veto another short-term extension.\xc2\xa0 Would the President be open to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Cheryl, for the specifics of Secretary Foxx\xe2\x80\x99s comments, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with his office.\xc2\xa0 But based on the way that you\'ve recounted them, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they\'re materially different than what I\xe2\x80\x99ve described as our position, which is that it is our view that the repeated use of short-term extensions does have a negative impact on our economy and on our ability to make tangible, critically needed investments in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure, and that our strong preference is that Congress get to work on a longer-term agreement that would allow the federal government to make a long-term commitment, a long-term investment in America\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis obviously would be a decision -- a commitment that is welcomed by the nation\xe2\x80\x99s governors and the nation\xe2\x80\x99s mayors in both parties because they deal firsthand with some of the neglected infrastructure upgrades that are needed.\xc2\xa0 And so that is essentially our position -- that we believe that these kinds of short-term extensions have not been good and it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Congress to focus on a longer-term investment and commitment to our infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\n\tCarol.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Is the 90-minute scheduled videoconference that the President had with Secretary Kerry last night different from the one you read out yesterday afternoon or the same one?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The same one -- that late in the day yesterday -- I guess it was yesterday afternoon, and we let you all know early yesterday evening that that took place.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry said that the President told him in that conversation that he can\'t wait forever to have a conclusion to these talks one way or another.\xc2\xa0 What did he mean by that?\xc2\xa0 What is his time frame?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that was essentially another way of saying that if a deal cannot be reached that is consistent with the parameters that were established in Lausanne that the American negotiating team will walk away.\xc2\xa0 And the President said that very forcefully in public, and I think that\'s the point.\xc2\xa0 As long as the talks continue to be useful, Secretary Kerry, Secretary Moniz and others will be deeply engaged in trying to reach a final agreement.\xc2\xa0 But if those talks don\'t appear to be useful anymore and there does not seem to be a constructive engagement on the part of the Iranians to resolving the remaining sticking points in the negotiations, then the President won\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to bring his team home.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there is a scenario in which the talks could -- I mean, you\'re basically saying that at some point the talks are no longer going to be useful?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think at some point, it will become clear that they\'re no longer -- that the talks are no longer constructive.\xc2\xa0 And again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what our expectations are for a final agreement, and the question is can the Iranians make those commitments.\xc2\xa0 And as long as they are working constructively in the context of those conversations to talk about how they can make those commitments, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep having those conversations.\xc2\xa0 But if at some point, it becomes clear that they\xe2\x80\x99re no longer willing to seriously commit to constructive conversations, then the American negotiating team will come home.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that means that you completely walk away from talks, or that you try to get some sort of arrangement where you could keep the interim agreement in effect?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to speculate about the outcome.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the interim agreement that\'s been in place for about a year and a half now is an agreement that has been good for the country and good for national security.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that agreement has succeeded in freezing in place Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 They have not been able to use diplomatic talks as cover to advance their nuclear program -- something that they have done in the past.\xc2\xa0 And there are even some key aspects of that agreement that have rolled back important parts of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that agreement has been good.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- and I would acknowledge -- I think it also merits pointing out that many Republicans who were initially critical of that interim agreement are now suggesting, and now even recommending, precisely the prospect that you have raised, which is that the interim agreement could just remain in place.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo at this point, however, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to speculate about what the outcome actually looks like.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 So this was mentioned earlier, but Secretary Kerry said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will not rush and we will not be rushed.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that an indication that this really is open-ended?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are you talking days, even weeks, or months, that as long as he feels progress is being made, the President is willing to let these talks continue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- what we\'re looking for are signs that the Iranians continue to constructively engage in trying to resolve the remaining sticking points.\xc2\xa0 And if it becomes clear that they\'re not willing to engage in those kinds of conversations, then the President will bring the negotiating team home.\xc2\xa0 How long that will last is something I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if it\xe2\x80\x99s weeks, that\'s not necessarily out of the realm of possibility?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the fact that they are closer than they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been before and the fact that we are really -- that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what our expectations are for a final agreement makes it unlikely that the talks would drag on for many more weeks.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate on the outcome.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it goes to 60 days for the review in front of Congress and gives opponents more time to essentially try to get the votes to scuttle an agreement.\xc2\xa0 Does that in any way -- if it goes to 60 days -- change the parameters of what kind of deal would be accepted, or what kind of deal John Kerry would bring back to the President to say not only do I think this is a good deal but it\xe2\x80\x99s one we can get through Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And again, the 60-day thing is not something that we\'re particularly concerned about.\xc2\xa0 The only reason they went from 30 to 60 days is to accommodate the 30-day vacation that members of Congress have planned for themselves.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re not too concerned about the 30-to-60-day window here, right?\xc2\xa0 But the point is it would not have a substantive impact on a final agreement that could be reached.\xc2\xa0 If the final agreement is settled consistent with the parameters that we\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to in Lausanne, then there will be a final agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that you had not talked to the President in the last 24 hours about the Confederate flag.\xc2\xa0 But there was an impassioned speech given by a Republican state representative who happened to be a descendent of Jefferson Davis that probably changed the outcome of that decision in the South Carolina legislature.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you know if the President saw that or had any reaction to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if he saw that or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you took a run at this, and I want to kind of come back to it, and that\'s sanctuary cities and what that policy really means from the White House perspective.\xc2\xa0 Do you support sanctuary cities?\xc2\xa0 And you talked a little bit about Secure Communities and Priority Enforcement.\xc2\xa0 But for the folks that don\'t sort of get down into the weeds, broadly speaking, sanctuary cities -- does the President support that idea?\xc2\xa0 Is that something the White House believes in?\xc2\xa0 And if not, why not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, the sanctuary cities movement was a movement that was essentially a response to significant concerns that have been raised by local law enforcement officials about the Secure Communities program.\xc2\xa0 And back in November when the President announced the whole suite of executive actions that would reform our broken immigration system, the President essentially set aside the Secure Communities program and implemented the Priority Enforcement program. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a different mechanism for state -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- for local and federal law enforcement officials to coordinate their efforts in terms of enforcing our nation\xe2\x80\x99s immigration laws.\xc2\xa0 And the Priority Enforcement program is one that is currently in the process of being implemented, and we have sought to implement that program with the goal of significantly improving the ability of local and federal law enforcement to work together on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we would expect as this program gets implemented that you would see better and more effective cooperation between law enforcement entities when it comes to enforcing our immigration laws.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So from the White House perspective, as they are currently run, sanctuary city programs leave a lot to be desired -- is that fair to say?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what this is evidence of is it\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of the fact that the executive actions that the President took were consistent with his goal of introducing greater accountability to our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 Right now when you talk about sanctuary cities and raising concerns about them, what\xe2\x80\x99s Congress doing about it right now?\xc2\xa0 Congressional Republicans aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing anything.\xc2\xa0 But they would have been able to take an important step in voting on comprehensive immigration reform legislation that had passed the Senate in bipartisan fashion but was blocked in the House -- this would have made a historic investment in border security and would have beefed up the capability of our law enforcement agencies to deal with those who have entered the country illegally and pose a threat to our communities and even pose a threat to our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut because Republicans in Congress didn\'t act and, in fact, actively blocked that legislation, we now are trying to use the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive authority to bring some much needed accountability to our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly what the Priority Enforcement program would do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You make the point that Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t acted, but the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come out personally and said, I don\'t think this is a good idea, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful to sort of give a pass to people who are here illegally and not hold them over and make sure that they\'re transported to federal authorities either.\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come out and said that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I disagree with that, Kevin.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very forceful in suggesting that our limited law enforcement resources should be focused on deporting individuals who do pose a threat to communities or to our national security. And the President has taken -- not just talked about it, he\xe2\x80\x99s actually taken tangible steps to try to bring about that end.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s because he does believe that public safety should be a priority when it comes to enforcing our immigration laws.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, he\xe2\x80\x99s put in place policies, using his executive authority, over the objection of Republicans to accomplish that goal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you specifically about an online petition right now that\'s being sent over to congressional lawmakers -- more than 150,000 signatures proposing something that they would call \xe2\x80\x9cKate\xe2\x80\x99s Law,\xe2\x80\x9d to honor the slain young woman in San Francisco who was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported some five times and committed several crimes while here. Some of the idea behind that petition would be to make mandatory five-year sentences in federal custody for any illegal immigrant who leaves -- or is deported, I should say, and then comes back and is caught or, in many cases, committing a crime.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf that makes its way through Congress, would the President sign something like that, a notion that would put people who are here illegally, deported, then come back -- send them to prison?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t mean to talk over you there, Kevin.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any sort of evaluation of this specific proposal by the administration, but I\xe2\x80\x99m confident our folks will take a look at it.\xc2\xa0 And if it\xe2\x80\x99s able to make its way through Congress we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a conversation with members of Congress about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another petition question.\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of that petition that seeks to strip Bill Cosby of his Presidential Medal of Freedom?\xc2\xa0 And if so, would he feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s a worthwhile thing to at least look into?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I got asked about this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of the specific petition.\xc2\xa0 I know that there had been a news release that had been generated on it.\xc2\xa0 And at this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific reaction to it other than to remind you, as I did yesterday, of the priority that this administration has placed on trying to counter sexual assault wherever it occurs, including in our military and on college campuses.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you find out if it was legal or not?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President\xe2\x80\x99s aware of it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President\xe2\x80\x99s aware of that effort?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of that specific effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say anything about the atmosphere that\xe2\x80\x99s at the Iran talks now?\xc2\xa0 There was a report on Monday that Secretary Kerry and his Iranian counterpart were yelling at each other.\xc2\xa0 Is that a sign of the tension at this stage of the final stretch?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been here, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been in those rooms.\xc2\xa0 I have spoken frequently with some of my colleagues who have been working diligently in Vienna to try to reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And, look, they\xe2\x80\x99re working really long hours over there, and they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about really serious issues, and they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about issues that are extraordinarily complicated and complex and have significant consequences for not just the relationship between the United States and Iran, but have significant consequences for the world.\xc2\xa0 And in many cases, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about negotiators who have spent hundreds of hours, if not thousands of hours, across the negotiating table from one another, often on very little sleep.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m not particularly surprised to read those reports of patience wearing a little thin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut if it is wearing thin, I\'m confident it\xe2\x80\x99s for the right reasons.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s because everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s sitting around that table understands that the stakes are high.\xc2\xa0 They understand that these talks are serious and have significant consequences.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that any sort of personal frustrations will inhibit the ability of our negotiators to reach an agreement if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for them to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right, Jim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was just going to follow up -- we\xe2\x80\x99re you able to find out whether it was legal for the President to revoke a Medal of Freedom?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The only thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to find out is that -- and I say this with not complete certainty -- but based on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at, the Presidential Medal of Freedom has not been revoked before.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know at this point whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that, though, then -- according to those who are asking for the medal to be rescinded, they\xe2\x80\x99re saying the President could issue an order that the 2002 Medal of Freedom bestowed on Bill Cosby is hereby rescinded.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re also saying that the President could make a request to Bill Cosby that he rescind it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what do you say to that?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s from the statement --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The only thing I know is just that it\xe2\x80\x99s never been done before.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you take that question?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to promise an answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have one.\xc2\xa0 But if I do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tRebecca, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Going back to the Confederate flag issue -- will the President direct the Park Service to ban the flag from national parks, including cemeteries, along the lines of the Democratic amendment passed in the House on Tuesday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Rebecca, let me get you the list of the steps that the National Park Service has already announced as they relate to the display of the Confederate flag on national park land.\xc2\xa0 And I know that there are a number of steps that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the administration is very supportive of the amendments that were passed unanimously in the House on Tuesday night that would place further limits on the display of the Confederate battle flag on National Park Service land.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up with you in terms of the details of the steps that have already been taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to the National Park Service or any other federal agencies on this issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President has directly spoken with anybody at the National Park Service about this.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised of some National Park Service officials did have a conversation with White House officials on this policy, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President was involved in those conversations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good day.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:55 P.M.
