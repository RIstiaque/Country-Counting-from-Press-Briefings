EDT</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: Good morning. So for starters, after being directed by the administration to move more quickly, BP is now stepping up its efforts to contain the leaking oil. They\xe2\x80\x99ve now outlined a path to contain more than 50,000 barrels of oil per day by the end of June, two weeks earlier than they had originally suggested.</p>\n<p>The revised plan also includes methods to achieve giving greater redundancy beyond the month of June to better allow for bad weather or unforeseen circumstances. This administration has continuously demanded strategies and responses from BP that fit the realities of this catastrophic event for which BP is responsible. We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to hold BP accountable and bring every possible resource and innovation to bear.</p>\n<p>Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to run through the schedule a little bit and pass it off to Admiral Allen to answer some of your questions.</p>\n<p>Obviously, we land in Biloxi; we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a 15-minute drive to Gulfport -- to the Coast Guard station there, where we\xe2\x80\x99ll be met by -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go over some of the top-line officials. Later we\xe2\x80\x99ll put out the full list of folks who were there. But Governor Jindal will be there, Governor Barbour; Senators Cochran and Wicker; Representative Taylor; Mayor George Schloegel of Gulfport.</p>\n<p>Then we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a five-minute drive to Combs Pier where we\xe2\x80\x99ll have lunch with the Governor, First Lady Marsha Barbour, the Gulfport Mayor and then local business owners.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a 15-minute helo ride to Theodore, where the President will receive a tour and briefing. There he will be joined by Governor Riley, Lieutenant Governor Jim Folsom, by Representative Jo Bonner.</p>\n<p>And at 3:40 p.m., as you know, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a statement where he will be flanked by the folks who are in the briefing with us. Then we\xe2\x80\x99re off to the Dauphin Island Ferry, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll to take a ferry ride to Fort Morgan. And then we\xe2\x80\x99re off to Pensacola.</p>\n<p>Then with that, do you guys have any questions for Admiral Allen about today? Or what\xe2\x80\x99s happening --</p>\n<p>Q On the change in BP, I mean, it was yesterday you made that call, and then last night, I believe, they made their announcement that they\'re going to be changing and updating how much oil they collect. What do you think precipitated the change? How were they able to do this so quickly?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN: Well, what\xe2\x80\x99s happened is this thing has evolved as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to refine the flow-rate estimates. And you know we revised them upward last week. We want to make sure that BP has enough capacity on hand to handle the increased flow-rate estimate. So therefore we gave them feedback to the original proposal. They were responsive within the timeline on occasions -- the first one was within 72 hours; we got the other one within 48 hours last night. The conditions changed between those two, so we thought it was necessary to go back and tell BP what you gave us we understand, but we need greater capacity and production capability to handle the increased flow rate. Tell us how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that.</p>\n<p>They were responsive. We got their proposals last night, evaluating those. And there will be a meeting today in Washington with Secretary Salazar and Secretary Chu on flow rate -- and the Flow Rate Technical Team. And then, over the next two days, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to broaden our outreach and bring in other industry partners and kind of get a validated view of this.</p>\n<p>The industry term for this is a cold eye\xe2\x80\x99s view. We have somebody from the outside disinterested looking in and assessing the execute-ability of the plan. So over the next couple of days, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take this latest proposal by BP and basically vet it and make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be responsive to what we think we need regarding the increased flow rate.</p>\n<p>Q Do you have confidence that they\xe2\x80\x99re actually going to be able to meet this 50,000 estimate?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN: Well, we told them to provide us the location of the vessels, how long it would take to get there, and what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing. Now, some of these vessels -- we\xe2\x80\x99re moving to a different mode of operation. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a fixed riser pipe fixed to a production platform right now. They want to take a free-standing riser pipe, one that\xe2\x80\x99s floating from anchor to the seabed and one that floats just below the surface. And then, they run a flexible hose that goes from the well head to the riser and a flexible hose from the top of the riser up to multiple production vessels, and therefore, increasing the redundancy and throughput of the capacity.</p>\n<p>The other thing we want them to do is, if you remember, when we were attempting the top kill operation, we were forcing mud down the wellbore through something called a choke and a kill line. We want to reverse that and pull oil up through them and create another path for production. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that right away with the Q4000, and that should happen sometime this week, get them on station and raise the capacity so we\xe2\x80\x99re up to at least 18,000 barrels a day. We\xe2\x80\x99re at about 15,000 right now. Ultimately --</p>\n<p>Q Fifteen thousand by when?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN: We\xe2\x80\x99re already at 18,000. Sorry -- we can go up to -- we can go up to -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, we can go up to 18,000 right now on the Discovery Enterprise. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get 5,000 to 10,000 more capacity out of the Q4000 when it\xe2\x80\x99s up and operating.</p>\n<p>Q And that --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN: A total of 28,000 --</p>\n<p>Q So by the end of this week, we\xe2\x80\x99re at 28,000?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN: Once the Q4000 is online and operating -- we have to get it up and get it started -- the combination of the Q4000 and the Discovery Enterprise will give us a maximum capacity of 28,000.</p>\n<p>Q And that\xe2\x80\x99s when those will all be stood up?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN: Well, then while we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that -- you got to understand, the way we\xe2\x80\x99re producing this right now, we have a fixed riser pipe to the Discovery Enterprise. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to run a separate line off the kill and the choke lines to the Q4000, so we have a different production line coming up that also gives us some redundancy.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, they\xe2\x80\x99ve already got the anchors in place for this floating riser system or we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make a conversion, because that will allow us to use multiple vessels and the larger vessels that are being brought in from the North Sea right now.</p>\n<p>Q But that 28,000 -- the goal for that -- is the end of this week?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN: Yes, yes.</p>\n<p>Q In terms of the size of the escrow account -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this is better for Bill or for you, Admiral Allen -- where is the administration, are they in the range of $20 billion? Or where does the White House think it should be?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a meeting on Wednesday where we\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk about some of these issues. This will be an account with billions of dollars. It will be evergreen. But it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re in discussions with BP right now.</p>\n<p>he number one goal here is that all the people who are affected by BP\xe2\x80\x99s oil spill are made whole. And the President is going to make sure that this account helps to take care of the claims facing them.</p>\n<p>Q More or less than $20 billion?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: I think that we are going to -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep working with BP to make a determination on where that\xe2\x80\x99s going.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q More or less than $10 billion?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: We can do this all day, can\xe2\x80\x99t we?</p>\n<p>Q How can you to compel -- will you have to compel BP to create this escrow account? How do you do that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: We\xe2\x80\x99re confident that we have the legal authority to compel BP to make sure that the folks that they have affected here are made whole. And we\xe2\x80\x99re also confident that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to move forward on that. The signs from BP aren\xe2\x80\x99t that there is going to be a protracted legal battle over this or anything like that.</p>\n<p>Q The signs from BP are not that there will be --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: That\'s right.</p>\n<p>Q Well, what is the legal authority we have?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a line-by-line in the code. But considering BP is going to do this, I don\'t think we have to go down the road of what lawyers are going to have to compel them to do in a court of law on this specific -- on this specific issue.</p>\n<p>Q So BP has agreed --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: Yes, I think -- anything else for Admiral Allen?</p>\n<p>Q Twenty-eight thousand barrels, is that 90 percent of the oil gushing? Or how much is that?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN: That\'s the $100,000 question -- we need a flow rate. And we\xe2\x80\x99re never going to know exactly what it is until we have a tight seal on that and we can actually measure production. As you know we got a pre-riser cut estimate, a low range of 20, high range of 40, but probably somewhere around 32, according to the Flow Rate Technical Group.</p>\n<p>Today they will meet and they\xe2\x80\x99ll consider additional information post-riser cut and also considering the information we\xe2\x80\x99re getting by putting the pressure reading devices down on the stack today to get better pressure readings. That will be reconciled with Secretary Chu this afternoon, so there will be -- may be some more information forthcoming here shortly.</p>\n<p>But that -- we\xe2\x80\x99re narrowing in on what the actual flow rate is. That tells us a couple things -- how much production capacity you need to have, but ultimately what is the ultimate size of the spill for the impact on the environment, working towards that.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: Okay, thanks, Admiral.</p>\n<p>Q Thank you, Admiral.</p>\n<p>Q You\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to use legal means to compel --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: Considering BP has been -- has seemed willing to move forward with an escrow account, right now we\xe2\x80\x99re just working out the particulars of -- amounts, administration things like that. It will be administered by a third-party entity, and you know we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that this is a critical way in which we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to help individuals and businesses in the Gulf area become whole again.</p>\n<p>Q But BP has indicated that they don\'t feel liable for the workers that have lost their job because the six-months moratorium that the President imposed. Are you now hearing signals from BP that they\'re willing to pay claims for workers who have lost their jobs as result of the President\xe2\x80\x99s six-month moratorium?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: I was speaking specifically about the escrow account, and as it relates to the individual claims, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a process through which they go. And I think that as we move forward on the discussions with BP, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted on where those things land.</p>\n<p>Q But you\xe2\x80\x99re not hearing anything different from BP on the six-month moratorium on workers from that, you\xe2\x80\x99re not hearing anything -- hearing any signals from them --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: I don\'t have anything new for you on that, no.</p>\n<p>Q Who is the third-party entity?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: That\'s part of the conversation that we\xe2\x80\x99re having to determine this.</p>\n<p>Q But in saying that BP appears willing to set up an escrow account, are you referring to what they had previously said? Or is there a new response from them to your -- to Axelrod\xe2\x80\x99s comments yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: We\xe2\x80\x99re in contact with BP every day, several times a day at different points and layers of our government and their corporation. And we feel confident that this is going to be able to move forward.</p>\n<p>Q What have they said specifically about their willingness to establish an escrow account?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: I don\'t have anything further than what I\xe2\x80\x99ve already said.</p>\n<p>Q When do you hope to have it set up?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: As soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Q Can you give us a preview of Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s speech?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: The President is going to talk directly with the American people about some of the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to stop the flow of oil into the Gulf, some of the things we\xe2\x80\x99ve done to mitigate the damage that\'s caused by the oil that\xe2\x80\x99s spilled out already and what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do moving forward here, how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to help to make the people of Mississippi and Alabama and Florida and all these states in the Gulf whole again as a result of the damage that\'s been caused.</p>\n<p>He\xe2\x80\x99ll talk a little bit about workers\xe2\x80\x99 safety. He\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to them about food safety, as well, to make sure that the American people know that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything that we can, that we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring in each and every place possible to ensure that folks are made whole, that the American people are kept safe.</p>\n<p>Q Can you talk about the significance that this is his first Oval Office address?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: What we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in the Gulf is a catastrophe the likes of which our country has never seen before, so the response has been enormous, the assets and the full power of the federal government has been brought to bear here, and so talking directly with the American people about what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to address this crisis and what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be doing moving forward is very important to the President right now.</p>\n<p>Q Do you have specifics on what time it will begin, how long it will be?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: It will begin at 8:00 p.m. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on length just yet. Are you worried about your prime time shows?</p>\n<p>Q I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to give guidance to editors.</p>\n<p>Q Twenty --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: Keep you posted.</p>\n<p>Q Are there going to be new policies announced in the speech?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: I would just say wait and see. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more for you on what the speech is tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q And on the escrow account, does -- did the President think that the Democrat senators, that their $20 billion figure, did that seem reasonable to the President?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: There are a lot of folks who have a lot of skin in the game here. And so for folks in Congress to make their views known on something that\xe2\x80\x99s as important as making sure that people who have seen losses are able to recoup those losses is perfectly appropriate. So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue talking to our partners in Congress. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue talking to BP on making sure that this is as effective as possible and that the American people are made whole.</p>\n<p>Q Is the amount of skin -- is the amount of skin in the game reasonable?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t --whether the --</p>\n<p>Q Well, the question is --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: -- is going to be measured in skin.</p>\n<p>Q Is that $20 billion a reasonable figure?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: Like I said, we are -- you\xe2\x80\x99re not be able to get anything more off me on a number. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q Where did that come from? Was it from Democrats and Republicans? There\xe2\x80\x99s -- Senator LeMieux offered this idea as well. Where did the White House come up with the idea to just --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: This is something that a lot of different people have -- have the idea of making an account by which these claims are paid. I think that the important thing here that a third party is going to administer it is something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to really help the folks of the Gulf region.</p>\n<p>Q Was it the President himself who wanted to do the Oval -- pick the Oval Office, use the Oval for the first time?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: Yes.</p>\n<p>Q And what did he say about his thinking in doing that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I can get any more creative than what I already said about what the President thought was important about addressing the American people from the Oval. He just thinks this is a critically important issue that a lot of people are concerned about, invested in, and want to see a resolution to.</p>\n<p>Q Non-BP question -- everyone cool with that? Is the President getting updates on Tajikistan -- with a K?</p>\n<p>Q Kyrgyzstan.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: Kyrgyzstan. That was Hans Nichols of Bloomberg.</p>\n<p>Q Why -- mispronounce that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: That was Hans Nichols at Bloomberg. (Laughter.) The President has been briefed regularly. And folks in the government have been in close contact with officials in the region, and of course with our counterparts in Russia to make sure that we are as up to date as possible.</p>\n<p>Q Has he spoken to Medvedev on it?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: He has not.</p>\n<p>Q I mean, you got Medvedev, right?</p>\n<p>Q What? (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: Nobody loves a transcript joke like Hans.</p>\n<p>Q Horribly. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s current view on what BP should do on dividends? What do they hope to see -- what do you hope to see come out of the meeting today, the BP meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new for you on that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll check on that.</p>\n<p>Q Is he going to specifically kick ass in the meeting on Wednesday?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: I appreciate that question, Erica Werner. (Laughter.) There are obviously a great deal of issues that the President is going to talk to BP about, not the least of which are making sure that claims are paid in a timely fashion, that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything possible in order to clean up the oil that spilled out into the Gulf; that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything possible to stop any further oil from coming out. So I think that this will be a very frank meeting.</p>\n<p>Q And just to make absolutely sure, you guys still want BP to pay the salaries of the oil rig workers who don\'t work for BP who are suffering under the moratorium?</p>\n<p>Q You still want that to happen?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: You know as we go through this process of setting up the escrow account, getting a third party in place in order to deal with the claims, I think that all these different issues will be handled through them.</p>\n<p>Q My colleague Ann Compton had a question, if BP is handling all associated costs with the spill are they covering the flight? The overnight and the helicopters, and all the rest?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: I don\'t believe so.</p>\n<p>Q So your position -- you don\'t have the same position that BP needs to pay laid-off workers\xe2\x80\x99 salaries? Robert had been clear on that.</p>\n<p>Q Are you now saying that this third party --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying anything new. I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that we are in the process of setting up an escrow account with a third-party entity in order to make sure that people are made whole here. There\xe2\x80\x99s no new administration position here other than there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an account through which a third party will ensure that people with claims are made whole.</p>\n<p>Q Before the position was that people will be made whole. It\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily going to be adjudicated by this third party. Is there -- is the third party now going to make the determination on whether or not laid-off workers will be -- need to be compensated by BP?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: Yes. (Laughter.) The position is the same on the workers.</p>\n<p>Q The six-month -- does it still apply to the six-month moratorium --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: As a result of the Q&amp;A, I think this has gotten more confusing than it needs to be. The position is not -- is unchanged on the workers who have lost their jobs as a result of the spill.</p>\n<p>Q So what Robert said before stands?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: It\xe2\x80\x99s still operative, yes. But unfortunately, because reporters are from Mars and I\xe2\x80\x99m from Venus, I don\'t think we -- that was communicated clearly.</p>\n<p>Q Did the President watch the USA-England game?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: I think so. Didn\'t he watch it? Do you know? I don\'t know.</p>\n<p>Q Anti-British ranting --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON: For the record, Helene Cooper, there has not been any anti-British ranting.</p>\n<p>Q Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n11:12 A.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
