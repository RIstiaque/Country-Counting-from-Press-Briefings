Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t1:46 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Happy Monday. \xc2\xa0As you might suspect from the screens behind me, I have a couple of comments at the top before I get to your questions. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m going with the subtle approach today. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs many of you may be aware, today marks the first day of summer, the summer solstice, which is an important reminder that families should be taking steps to prepare for local transmission of mosquito-borne diseases like Zika. \xc2\xa0The graphic behind me outlines these measures, including how to prevent mosquito bites, and the importance of removing standing water inside and outside your house -- for example, pet water bowls, vases and open trash containers.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile Zika poses the biggest risk to pregnant women, now that summer is here, travelers visiting Zika-affected areas should also be mindful of the risk of personal infection, and of the risk of spreading Zika within the continental United States upon their return. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe know that last year, U.S. citizens made more than 80 million visits to one of the 46 CDC-listed Zika-affected countries. \xc2\xa0Individuals who traveled to these regions should be taking steps to prevent mosquito bites. \xc2\xa0They also need to wear mosquito repellant for three weeks after returning to the United States to prevent Zika spread to family and friends, and men with pregnant partners who traveled to Zika-affected areas need to take special precautions to protect their partners.</p>\n<p>\n\tToday is also another reminder that it has been nearly four months since the President submitted a request to Congress for $1.9 billion in funding that our public health experts and scientists say that we need to prepare for Zika. \xc2\xa0In those four months, despite inaction from Congress, the federal government has been hard at work redirecting nearly $600 million in existing funds as a stopgap measure.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe administration has also been coordinating closely with state and local officials, both to limit the potential for transmission in the continental United States, but also to ensure that everyone is ready to respond once local transmission of Zika is detected. \xc2\xa0In addition, state and local officials are taking action on their own. \xc2\xa0And here\xe2\x80\x99s a flavor of what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen public health departments from New York City to Tallahassee, Florida, to Sacramento, California, to Houston, Texas -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve begun campaigns to educate residents about mosquito control and Zika. \xc2\xa0County and state health departments are bulking up their mosquito control and tracking, including places as far-flung as Hillsborough County, Florida, to Douglas County, Nebraska. \xc2\xa0And some health departments, including here in the D.C. area, have created Zika-prevention kits to educate and protect residents. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo while federal, state and local leaders have been hard at work, congressional Republicans continue to drag their feet. \xc2\xa0This is a public health emergency, and Congress needs to stop playing politics with the health and safety of the American people. \xc2\xa0Congress must pass emergency funding today to ensure we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything in our power to protect pregnant women and children. \xc2\xa0The House Zika bill provided no new money and did nothing but essentially cannibalize existing funds. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly not the answer.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring the conference process this week, we ask that members of Congress take their job to protect the American people seriously, and we ask them to provide the full funding that our administration -- that our public health and safety professionals say that we need, and they should take that action before they leave on their Fourth of July recess.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take your questions on the Zika virus or anything else that may be on your mind today. \xc2\xa0Kathleen, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to start with Zika, though. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What? \xc2\xa0Come on. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Are you saying that all your questions have been answered?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All my questions. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0No, I wanted to start with the transcripts of the 911 calls in Orlando, if I could. \xc2\xa0The administration is being criticized for the redactions of those transcripts, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about why those transcripts were redacted and whether the FBI should release the full transcript.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This obviously is pursuant to an ongoing law enforcement investigation. \xc2\xa0The decision about the release of the transcripts is one that was made solely by Department of Justice and FBI officials. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re doing that consistent with their assessment about the best way to advance the investigation, and so for questions about the transcripts I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not a sensitivity issue; it\xe2\x80\x99s actually about advancing the investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that all decisions about releasing the transcripts were made by Department of Justice officials. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the White House has no opinion on whether or not those decisions were appropriate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The opinion of the White House is that we should not interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation, and rather that those decisions should be made consistent with the assessment that is made by law enforcement officials about the best way to advance their investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And then just secondly, the Senate is going to hold votes today -- four votes on different gun measures and they\xe2\x80\x99re all expected to fail. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if, from the White House perspective, if there\xe2\x80\x99s any progress here at all, or if you consider this all sort of political theater of some sort, holding votes that no one expects to pass.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the view of the administration is that the American public should be engaged in the debate. \xc2\xa0And for too long, we have seen Republicans in Congress use the majority that they have in the Congress to block progress, in some cases even block consideration of common-sense measures that would reduce gun violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the fact that this is something that is being actively debated and considered in the Senate does represent some incremental progress. \xc2\xa0The President has also been pretty blunt about the fact that we won\xe2\x80\x99t see the needed change in our gun laws until we start seeing needed changes in Congress. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has just used his own executive authority to make as many changes as he can to make our communities safer from gun violence. \xc2\xa0The President has also vowed to use his political capital and to only support and actively campaign for members of Congress that share his commitment to prioritizing common-sense measures that would reduce gun violence. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention that Senator Susan Collins is supposedly working on some sort of deal. \xc2\xa0Is that because you don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there\xe2\x80\x99s any help for any --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s primarily related to the fact that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the results of her work that is reportedly ongoing. \xc2\xa0So the President\xe2\x80\x99s appetite for common-sense gun safety legislation in Congress is well known. \xc2\xa0And the only way that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to make progress is by working in bipartisan fashion. \xc2\xa0Thus far, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a partisan effort on the part of Republicans to shut down that debate and shut down any progress toward passing these common-sense laws. \xc2\xa0So we obviously would encourage members of Congress to get it done.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll bite on Zika. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0So given all the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Aedes aegypti.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Given all the travel statistics and other information you presented, how do you know that Zika is not being transmitted in the U.S. yet? \xc2\xa0What makes you confident that it\xe2\x80\x99s not happening -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s not already being transmitted local yet?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, this is something that local health departments are closely monitoring. \xc2\xa0So they\xe2\x80\x99re obviously aware, as best they can, based on getting reports from local physicians and other health care workers in local communities, about the Zika virus. \xc2\xa0And when individuals are suspected of having Zika, they are able to go through -- they\xe2\x80\x99re able to take some tests to diagnose that disease, and then once the diagnosis has been completed and if they test positive for the disease, and there is some work done to determine how exactly they may have contracted the virus, there have been some instances of sexual transmission of the Zika virus, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a source of some concern among public health professionals here as well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why there is an effort to try to educate the public, particularly men who have partners who are pregnant or could become pregnant, about the risk that they could pose to their partners. \xc2\xa0So there are some steps that could be taken to significantly mitigate that risk, and we obviously want everyone to be educated so that they know exactly what steps they need to take to prevent the transmission of this disease.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask about this event on Friday with Mark Zuckerberg that Jeff Zients wrote about today. \xc2\xa0I guess I\'m wondering, given what\'s happened in Orlando, whether the President is going to be talking at all while he\'s there in Silicon Valley about new ways to counter extremism on social media, and whether he plans to push Mark Zuckerberg at all on encryption, given that WhatsApp is now fully encrypted, and also whether the President is concerned about the role that Facebook\'s news algorithms play in campaign coverage.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the focus of the President\'s panel that includes Mr. Zuckerberg will be on innovation and the important role it plays in a strong U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0That will be the focus of their discussions. \xc2\xa0So it\'s possible that some of these other topics could come up. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As it relates to the effort to work with the tech community to counter the strategies of using social media to radicalize vulnerable individuals that\xe2\x80\x99s used by ISIL, we\'ve made some important progress in that regard. \xc2\xa0There has been effective work that the U.S. government and technology companies have been able to cooperate on. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Friday, this past Friday, the President\'s top homeland security advisor, Lisa Monaco, put out a statement lauding the efforts of an organization called the Counter Extremism Project\'s National Office for Reporting Extremism. \xc2\xa0They\'ve been engaged in some work coordinating with counterterrorism professionals and law enforcement and technology to counter the online activities of terrorist organizations. \xc2\xa0And they have had some success in countering extremism online, and that cooperative effort is something that the President is strongly supportive of. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s why you saw the statement from Lisa Monaco last week. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, that\'s not the topic of the panel. \xc2\xa0I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that it could come up, though. \xc2\xa0But we obviously are looking for ways that we can cooperate with organizations like Facebook in the same way that we have in countering things like child pornography, that law enforcement in the United States has been able to work effectively with the tech community to counter the proliferation of child pornography. \xc2\xa0And we believe that we can effectively pursue a similar strategy to counter radicalizing messages online, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around a little bit. \xc2\xa0Michelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0You\'ve often spoken about -- as has the President -- not wanting to play into ISIS\'s propaganda, not wanting to further the propaganda. \xc2\xa0And that\'s what Attorney General Lynch said these redactions are about. \xc2\xa0So does the White House not want to weigh in on that, and why not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Michelle, this is the subject of an ongoing investigation, and the decisions about the investigation are made by law enforcement professionals. \xc2\xa0And those law enforcement professionals have to balance a lot of different equities, including protecting against potentially playing into ISIL propaganda. \xc2\xa0They also have an obligation to be as transparent as possible. \xc2\xa0And I know that the Attorney General indicated that that was an important priority, as well. \xc2\xa0But how they strike that appropriate balance is a decision that should be left up to our law enforcement professionals, particularly when it comes to something that is so central to the ongoing investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And she\'s the one shedding on why, she\'s making that explanation -- which, again, is something we\'ve heard from the White House a lot as being a priority when you\'re dealing with things like this. \xc2\xa0And it\'s clear that the President cares a lot about sort of the backlash, the rhetoric that has grown up around the President not using the words "radical Islamic terror." \xc2\xa0We\'ve heard the President\'s own words, kind of his rebuttal to all of that, a few days ago. \xc2\xa0So now that Republicans, in particular the Speaker of the House, is saying that these redactions are preposterous, do you worry that that\'s going to just rev up that sentiment even more?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the statement from the Speaker of the House, but what our law enforcement professionals are doing is they are reviewing the material that\'s available to them; they\'re doing their best to follow all the leads to determine what events, what activities, and what conversations led up to this horrific terrorist attack. \xc2\xa0And the desire of law enforcement officials, as they\'ve publicly stated, is to further the investigation and learn as much as possible, elicit information from the public that may be known to individuals of the public about this individual, and also be as transparent as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, it\'s up to our law enforcement professionals to be focused on the task at hand, not be distracted by politics, and make these decisions consistent with their judgement. \xc2\xa0And the administration believes that\'s what they should do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And speaking generally, if the redaction of anything is going to be because we don\xe2\x80\x99t want something to play into ISIS\'s propaganda -- but that reason is already known. \xc2\xa0I mean, the gist of what a person has said is already known and out there. \xc2\xa0 So do you worry that a redaction, even though it\'s supposed to be in the interest of transparency, is happening for that reason, do you worry that something like that is not preposterous?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, this is up to the FBI and Department of Justice officials to decide. \xc2\xa0And I\'ll let them explain their decisions, so I\'ll leave it to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, two subjects. \xc2\xa0One, I want to ask you a little bit about Donald Trump and this gun issue. \xc2\xa0The NRA is quipping at what you said about the Orlando shooter and what happened there. \xc2\xa0What are your thoughts as this gun debate continues? Donald Trump is now lending his voice. \xc2\xa0The NRA is not necessarily happy with him. \xc2\xa0And the President cannot get movement on this almost at the end of his term at all. \xc2\xa0What is all of this mosh right now? \xc2\xa0This is coming together --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, April, I think the President believes that common-sense gun safety measures is something that should be a priority in the Congress. \xc2\xa0And unfortunately it\'s not. \xc2\xa0And the reason it\'s not is that Republicans have a majority in the Congress, and they\'ve been unwilling to support common-sense measures that would reduce gun violence without gutting the basic constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. \xc2\xa0And that\'s unfortunate, but that\'s not just the situation that we find ourselves in here at the end of the Obama presidency. \xc2\xa0That\'s a situation that we found ourselves in several years ago, even in the aftermath of a horrific shooting in an elementary school in Connecticut.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So do you see a glimmer of hope, even as this President is leaving? \xc2\xa0It may not happen on his watch, but there could be a change in the mindset any time you have the NRA going up against the presumed -- presumptive Republican nominee on issues of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, I think it\'s unclear exactly how opinions inside the United States Congress are changing, but we are seeing ample evidence that minds across the country are made up in support of common-sense measures that would reduce gun violence. \xc2\xa0As you\'ve heard me say many times, there\'s plenty of polling to indicate that it\'s not just a majority of Democrats who support closing the background check loophole. \xc2\xa0There\'s ample evidence to indicate that a majority of Republicans and a majority of gun owners share the same view. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that, you would think, would lead to overwhelming support for something like the amendment that\'s been put forward by Senator Murphy that will get considered by the Senate later today. \xc2\xa0This would ensure that everyone who tries to purchase a gun is subject to a background check. \xc2\xa0That\'s a common-sense proposition, but yet one that is overwhelmingly opposed by Republicans. \xc2\xa0That is unfortunate. \xc2\xa0But that\'s why the President has observed that we\'re only going to see the change we\'d like to see in gun safety laws when we see a change in Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I\'m trying to get you to kind of take the fight from what I\'m -- Donald Trump, NRA -- got anything on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, great. \xc2\xa0Moving on to the next subject. \xc2\xa0Twitter was abuzz last night with a story about the Supreme Court -- Justice Clarence Thomas mulling over the possibilities of retiring. \xc2\xa0What say you as there is an opening right now and there\'s no hearing set for your nominee? \xc2\xa0This could be two openings before he leaves. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any insight into the future career plans of any Supreme Court justices at this point. \xc2\xa0But, look, the fact that we have gone this far without Republicans in the Senate being willing to give a hearing to the President\'s nominee to fill the current vacancy in the Supreme Court is extraordinary, it\'s unprecedented, and it\'s terrible for our system of democracy. \xc2\xa0And it is an escalation of partisan politics into a branch of government that we have gone to great lengths to try to insulate from partisan divisions. \xc2\xa0That\'s unfortunate. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\'s particularly unfortunate when you consider that the President put forward a nominee that has more judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history. \xc2\xa0The President put forward a nominee that even Republicans acknowledge is a consensus pick. \xc2\xa0You\'ve got Republicans publicly admitting that the only reason that they\'re not considering this individual is because he was nominated by a Democratic President. \xc2\xa0All of that sets up a situation that is entirely inconsistent with what the Framers of our Constitution intended. \xc2\xa0It\'s ironic because that kind of situation has been precipitated by a bunch of people who describe themselves as strict interpreters of the Constitution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, unfortunately, however, rationality and facts and appeals for fairness have fallen on deaf ears in the Republican conference of the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0And that\'s unfortunate when you consider the profound impact it has on our system of government.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- has President Obama met with Clarence Thomas at all during his time here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I can think of off the top of my head.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ron.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the terrorism attacks, the President and others noted that the last two were American citizens who are I guess -- a lone wolf. \xc2\xa0Is there anything new that the administration is doing to focus in on that particular problem, that particular threat that the country faces now that this is such a -- again, pushing back about the immigration debate, the radical Islam -- what\xe2\x80\x99s really being done about this phenomenon of home-grown terrorism?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Ron, there are a couple of things that come to mind. \xc2\xa0The first is that the FBI has more than 100 joint terrorism task forces that are at work all across the country. \xc2\xa0These task forces are essentially a way to integrate federal resources and state and local law enforcement resources to fight terrorism. \xc2\xa0And these task forces are focused on trying to prevent suspected terrorists from moving forward with a terrorist act. \xc2\xa0And it is not uncommon for the Department of Justice to issue news releases announcing the results of a joint terrorism task force investigation to announce the arrest of an individual who is planning to carry out a terrorist attack.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So that certainly is one way that we -- and when I say \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d I mean primarily the law enforcement community is keeping the American people safe. \xc2\xa0The other thing that we are very focused on is countering the use of social media by extremist organizations to radicalize people who could be vulnerable to that kind of inspiration. \xc2\xa0And that is relevant in the two cases that you cited because these are American citizens who the evidence indicates was potentially heavily influenced by this online propaganda.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there some effort to increase the size of those task forces? \xc2\xa0Is there some staffing increase, some change in their scope, or is that the essence of their response?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'d refer you to the FBI for consideration of the question about whether or not they feel like additional resources are needed to ensure the success of these ongoing investigations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just on the guns front, I think that people sort of asked this and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve said essentially the President has exhausted his range of -- what he sees as his range of options in terms of executive action and it\'s basically on the Congress. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more in the seven and a half months or so that he has left that he can do. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, you actually -- just because you asked the question that way, you did remind me of a third thing that we certainly could do that would make the country safer from the risks that you outlined, and that is we could close the loophole that currently allows individuals who are on the no-fly list but are still, right now, under existing law, able to walk into a gun store and buy a gun. \xc2\xa0The President thinks that that is a policy that only endangers the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The truth is, if it is too dangerous for you to board an airplane it should be too dangerous for you to buy a gun. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why we strongly support the amendment that Senator Feinstein has put forward to try to close that loophole.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In terms of -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve often talked about -- scrubbing the laws and so forth -- there\xe2\x80\x99s really nothing expected that he thinks he can do?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President and his team announced a set of executive actions early this year that would have an impact on individuals who are seeking to circumvent getting background checks. \xc2\xa0But there are a number of things that are tied up in those proposals that include increasing funding for the ATF to allow them to hire 200 more agents that would more effectively enforce the gun laws that are on the books. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Again, you hear Republicans in Congress saying that they believe that gun laws that are already on the books should be more effectively enforced. \xc2\xa0But yet they are blocking funding to hire additional resources and additional officers who would do exactly that. \xc2\xa0So it\'s a little hard to take their prescriptions particularly seriously. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the President believes that the country would be safer if there were more ATF officers on the beat enforcing our gun laws and protecting the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When can we expect that event that the President cancelled with Senator Clinton to happen again? \xc2\xa0Soon?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t have date for you. \xc2\xa0Obviously coordinating the schedules of Secretary Clinton and President Obama is complicated, particularly this time of year. \xc2\xa0Both of them are quite busy. \xc2\xa0But there are active conversations that the President\xe2\x80\x99s senior aide David Simas, who handles these political matters, is having with the Clinton campaign to determine a mutually agreeable time for us to reschedule that event.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Perhaps this week?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I just don\'t have an update for you. \xc2\xa0But when we do, we\'ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just lastly, on conversations, are there any further conversations between the President and Senator Sanders, and what is his status? \xc2\xa0What does the President see as his status? \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s still running for President, apparently.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of any additional conversations that the President has had with Senator Sanders since he was here a couple weeks ago now. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Senator Sanders is still running for President.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It does appear that way. \xc2\xa0But as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say for a couple of weeks now, Senator Sanders has earned the support of more than 10 million Democrats across the country and he certainly is entitled to make his own decisions about his own campaign on his own schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Kevin. \xc2\xa0Welcome back.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Appreciate that. \xc2\xa0Good to see you. \xc2\xa0Has the President been briefed on the violence -- the latest violence in Afghanistan that took place over the weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know if the President has received a specific briefing on this. \xc2\xa0Obviously we have seen those reports, and obviously we condemn these actions that at least in one case targeted innocent civilians, and in another case targeted essentially peacekeepers. \xc2\xa0So that\'s -- this does underscore the difficult security situation that continues to exist in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0And the United States and our NATO partners continue to stand with the Afghan government as they counter the threat from extremists and terrorists inside their own country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to throw some numbers past you. \xc2\xa0In 2011, there were approximately 97,000 American service personnel in Afghanistan, and that number has been cut to roughly just under 10,000 now. \xc2\xa0Has there been any reconsideration or regret, if you will, in dropping that number down given the increase or uptick in violence in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There has not, Kevin, and the decisions that the President has been making about appropriate troop levels and about an appropriate military posture in Afghanistan is consistent with the guidance and advice that he\xe2\x80\x99s receiving not just from his military advisors on the ground and at the Pentagon, but also the rest of his national security team. \xc2\xa0And the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the last time we talked you said the drawdown was under review -- because I remember specifically that I think it was 2014, you suggested that the President wanted to get it down maybe even to 1,000, maybe just sort of making sure that the embassy was safe there. \xc2\xa0But that plan has been under review. \xc2\xa0So I\'m wondering if that review is ongoing, and if that has been reconsidered completely given the circumstances on the ground.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, Kevin, that a month or so ago -- maybe it was longer ago than that -- General Campbell transitioned out of the job as commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, General Nicholson transitioned in. \xc2\xa0And in the early stages of his tenure, General Nicholson has been conducting a review to determine the appropriate military posture for U.S. servicemembers on the ground in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0And that includes a review of the number of troops that he believes he needs to succeed in the mission that the President has given him. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat review is still ongoing. \xc2\xa0The latest update that I heard at the end of last week is that the results of that review have not been relayed to the President at this point. \xc2\xa0But the President is working very closely with the members of his national security team and our military commanders on the most effective way for us to protect our interests in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0And that means making sure that Afghanistan cannot be used as a safe haven for terrorist organizations that seek to do harm against the United States. \xc2\xa0It means fulfilling the commitments that we have made both militarily but also financially and diplomatically to the Afghan government.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the end of 2014, the Afghan government did assume responsibility for the security situation in Afghanistan, and in that time, U.S. forces and NATO forces have been working to train up Afghan security forces and to support them as they take on this very difficult challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you satisfied with the pace of that training?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to DOD for an update on that assessment. \xc2\xa0I think overall in Afghanistan I don\'t think anybody can be satisfied with the ongoing violence that we see there. \xc2\xa0And the good news is that we have seen Afghan security forces be quite resilient, that they have demonstrated a clear willingness to fight for their country, that they do have the commitment and the drive to take significant risks and to put themselves in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way to try to defeat the extremists that are wreaking havoc in their country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the American people and our NATO partners and our men and women in uniform stand with the Afghan government and the Afghan security forces as they undertake that difficult mission. But this is a mission that has consequences for U.S. national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple more. \xc2\xa0One on Garland and one on the Syrian refugees. \xc2\xa0Is there a reason -- and forgive me if you\xe2\x80\x99ve covered this -- is there a reason to want to accelerate the number of Syrian refugees that might be brought here to this country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, the goal that the President has set is for the end of this fiscal year -- so, basically, by the end of September -- for 10,000 Syrian refugees to be admitted to the United States. \xc2\xa0These individuals, however, have to undergo the most rigorous screening of any individual that attempts to enter the United States. \xc2\xa0These individuals have to undergo a background check. \xc2\xa0They have to submit biographical and biometric information that is then run through a variety of data bases that are maintained by law enforcement, intelligence community and military organizations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is that for all refugees, or just Syrian refugees?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s for all refugees, but certainly includes Syrian refugees. \xc2\xa0The reason I mention it here is that the President has indicated a desire to try to increase the number of Syrian refugees in this fiscal year, but the President has made clear that we\'re not going to cut any security corners in meeting that goal.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the Department of Homeland Security, our intelligence community, and the Department of State are actively working to meet that goal. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been some reporting in recent weeks that the administration is behind pace to meet that goal, but we continue to be hopeful that as we continue to increase resources that are dedicated to that effort, we may still be able to reach that goal. \xc2\xa0Certainly the officials who are working closely on this are aware of that goal and understand that it\xe2\x80\x99s a priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last, on Merrick Garland, is it time for the President to head back to the Hill? \xc2\xa0Or is it just time to give up? \xc2\xa0I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a while, and Chief Judge Garland doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be getting any traction. \xc2\xa0Is there anything planned for this week that you can let us know about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule. \xc2\xa0But this is still a priority, and this is still a level of obstruction that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen before. \xc2\xa0And we continue to see Republicans struggling to explain their position. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, that discomfort has not translated into tangible legislative action.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, I think the American people understand the stakes of filling a Supreme Court vacancy. \xc2\xa0And the American people understand that the President has done his job by appointing a highly experienced, very well-regarded nominee that even Republicans have described as a consensus nominee. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, Republicans in the Senate refuse to do their job. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s not that they won\xe2\x80\x99t support this individual, they won\xe2\x80\x99t even consider Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0They won\xe2\x80\x99t even give him a hearing. \xc2\xa0They won\xe2\x80\x99t even give him a vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd even some Republican senators have criticized that posture. \xc2\xa0Even Senator Kirk has said that the Senate should \xe2\x80\x9cman up and vote\xe2\x80\x9d on Chief Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s nomination. \xc2\xa0And in that regard, he\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0First, I was wondering if you had any comment on Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s decision to dismiss his campaign manager today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I do not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask about Brexit. \xc2\xa0The vote is obviously later this week, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it a few times, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could maybe address specifically any steps the U.S. government, the Obama administration are taking to prepare for the possibility that Britain could leave the EU, and whether there are specific areas of concern, from treaties, from trade deals or anything like that where you guys are kind of looking at what the ramifications of an exit would be.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Justin, with regard to our position -- this is something that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President communicate directly, including when he was in London earlier this year -- the United States of America continues to believe and value a strong U.K. and a strong EU. \xc2\xa0So the British people will decide what they believe is in the best interest of their country, but the President has made clear what he believes is in the best interest of the United States. \xc2\xa0And given the special relationship between our two countries, we believe that that matters. \xc2\xa0How much that matters, though, will ultimately be up to the British people to decide. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWith regard to contingency planning, there are various aspects of the federal government that are quite focused on a wide range of contingencies for which they need to plan. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that somebody somewhere in the U.S. government is considering what sort of contingencies may need to be considered in the event that this vote goes down in the direction of the U.K. leaving the EU. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details about that. \xc2\xa0I think the polling indicates that this continues to be an uncertain outcome at this point. \xc2\xa0But this is a decision that will be made by the British people, as it should be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I was wondering if you could describe the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan for signing the chemical safety bill this week. \xc2\xa0And also, some critics of the legislation say it handcuffs the ability of states like California to press forward with tougher chemical safety regulations, and so why the legislation\'s positives, which you guys have extolled, sort of speaks to that or overwhelms that in your guys\xe2\x80\x99 mind.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we can do just a scheduling announcement here -- that on Wednesday, the President will sign H.R. 2576, which is better known as the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. \xc2\xa0The signing ceremony will take place in the South Court Auditorium, and there will be members of Congress, advocates and organizations that played a critical role in passing this legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a rare instance of strong bipartisan support for a piece of legislation. \xc2\xa0We haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a lot of that over the last year and a half, but I think that is an indication of how this bill could ultimately make our communities safer. \xc2\xa0And I think any time you see Democrats and Republicans come together on a piece of legislation, it does reflect a measure of compromise, which means that there may be some people who will criticize it because it\xe2\x80\x99s not perfect. \xc2\xa0But the President believes strongly that by instituting more uniform standards, we can more effectively regulate substances that are used in consumer products in a way that ultimately will better protect the American people. \xc2\xa0And the President was pleased to see Democrats and Republicans come together in strong support of this bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0I assume you guys were happy that the Supreme Court decided to review a lower court ruling that had sort of thrown into doubt the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to temporarily fill top government jobs. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can talk about that, and also if there\xe2\x80\x99s concern that, because of the way the Supreme Court operates with vacancies, that if this comes down to a split decision you could see a good number of the President\xe2\x80\x99s sort of nominees or appointees have their actions sort of invalidated by the split-court decision. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, Justin, we continue to have a lot of confidence in the legal power of the arguments that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be making in this case. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to handicap the outcome at this point because it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the Supreme Court has now agreed to consider. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to make an argument before the Supreme Court, and we feel confident that we have a strong argument to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, with regard to filling vacancies, I do think that this underscores another element of congressional dysfunction. \xc2\xa0There are critically important jobs that don\xe2\x80\x99t have confirmed officials leading them. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a significant problem when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about our counterterrorism strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot in here about Adam Szubin. \xc2\xa0This is a career professional who has served in both administrations who is the point person for implementing our sanctions against terrorist organizations, and even state sponsors of terrorism around the globe. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s a financial expert, and he was nominated more than a year ago and has still not gotten the vote that he needs on the floor of the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe same could be true of Beth Cobert. \xc2\xa0Beth is somebody who was nominated almost a year ago to lead the Office of Personnel Management, and yet for reasons that Republicans are unable to articulate, she has not gotten a vote either, despite the fact that she is unquestionably qualified for the job. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this underscores I think a little of the frustration that we have about this particular case, because the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s been interpreted by some courts essentially suggests that individuals can\xe2\x80\x99t do the job if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been confirmed by Congress, but yet when you have as many examples as we have of a Congress refusing to confirm individuals that are unquestionably qualified, you start to see the process break down. \xc2\xa0And it means that critically important functions like implementing sanctions against terrorist organizations, or managing the human resources of the entire federal workforce are undermined by a dysfunctional Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ll make our arguments before the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0But we certainly would appreciate a more conscientious Congress fulfilling their basic responsibility to ensure that our government can work.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was the executive branch consulted in any way by the Justice Department about the release of the 911 transcript?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the Department of Justice is part of the executive branch, but the White House --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Make it the Executive Office of the President, if you wish.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This is a decision that was made entirely by the Department of Justice and by officials at the FBI.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No consultation with the Office of the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to every single conversation, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the censorship was not at all reviewed here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It was not. \xc2\xa0This was a decision that was made solely by officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI consistent with their need to be as transparent as possible about the investigation, but also to make sure that they could advance the investigation by eliciting additional information about the suspect from the public.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Might they have received some guidance beforehand from here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, they did not.</p>\n<p>\n\tJerome.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Secretary of State John Kerry said today that he had read the dissent cable about the White House Syria strategy and he found it \xe2\x80\x9cvery good.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I was wondering whether the President had read the cable and whether he shared that view.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I do not know whether or not the President has read the cable. \xc2\xa0I think, as you heard my colleague indicate at the end of last week, the President does believe that having a procedure in place for State Department employees to make their dissenting views known is valuable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so the process that\xe2\x80\x99s in place is worthwhile. \xc2\xa0But I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been just as clear about the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy in Syria, how it has not led yet to the results that we would like to see in Syria, but it has prevented a repetition of mistakes that previous administrations have made. \xc2\xa0So, for example, the President has been quite clear that the United States, not anyone else, will be successful. \xc2\xa0Let me say that more clearly: \xc2\xa0The United States will not be successful, nor will anyone else, in imposing a military solution on the problems inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0That, I think, is a basic lesson that we learned after the 2003 invasion of Iraq that was ordered by the previous administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is a simple lesson learned, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that we should keep in mind as we confront the situation inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s also true is our efforts inside of Syria right now are focused on ISIL. \xc2\xa0And any careful consideration of directing military assets or intelligence assets against the Assad regime means that there are fewer assets and resources that are being directed at ISIL. \xc2\xa0And ISIL is the terrorist organization that poses a threat to the United States and our interests around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have maintained this intense focus on ISIL. \xc2\xa0But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that our diplomats at the State Department have been working tirelessly and tenaciously to build international consensus -- and they\xe2\x80\x99ve succeeded in this -- about the need for a political transition inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten organizations -- I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten countries like Russia and even Iran, that we know are strong supporters of the Assad regime, that are making at least vaguely constructive contributions to the ongoing process to facilitate a political transition.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat international pressure is going to be critical to our success. \xc2\xa0And we have seen that that international pressure has succeeded in putting in place a cessation of hostilities that has not worked nearly as well as we would have liked. \xc2\xa0But there are places where that cessation of hostilities has allowed significant humanitarian relief to be provided to hundreds of thousands of Syrians who desperately need it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s the explanation for the policy that we have pursued thus far. \xc2\xa0And when you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with a situation as complicated and as difficult and as high stakes as the situation inside of Syria, trying to stifle dissent is the wrong option. \xc2\xa0The President welcomes ideas from anyone that has a good one. \xc2\xa0But the President has been just as clear about the kinds of principles that we need to abide by in order to protect our interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the truth is, the strategy that we have pursued thus far has yielded some important results. \xc2\xa0We just haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten as far as we\xe2\x80\x99d like.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would the President be ready to meet these diplomats?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any meeting like that that\xe2\x80\x99s on the books, but if something like that were to happen we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to follow up on Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s question about Merrick Garland and to see if you could give me a better sense of what he\xe2\x80\x99s been up to the last weeks, up to this week. \xc2\xa0When we got started, you were giving us a lot of information about senators that he was meeting with and kind of giving us updates on the number of senators he\xe2\x80\x99s met with. \xc2\xa0Do you have any --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I can get you the specific numbers. \xc2\xa0I think that he\xe2\x80\x99s met with just about every single Democratic senator in the United States Senate, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to see a Democratic senator say he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve a hearing and a vote. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s met with a number of Republican senators, at least of couple of them who have indicated that he does deserve a hearing and a vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is the situation that we find ourselves in right now. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make a public case that Republicans in the Senate should stop blocking the most experienced Supreme Court nominee in American history. \xc2\xa0And I say he\xe2\x80\x99s the most experienced Supreme Court nominee in our history because he\xe2\x80\x99s spent more time on the federal bench than any other Supreme Court nominee in history. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is the current situation. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got Republicans in the Senate who are refusing to do their job. \xc2\xa0And in this case, it has unfortunate and significant consequences for the successful functioning of our democracy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s he up to this week? \xc2\xa0Does he have any meetings on the Hill? \xc2\xa0Are you guys continuing to look for those, schedule those?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there aren\xe2\x80\x99t -- I believe at this point he has now met with 16 Republican senators. \xc2\xa0That means there are more than 30 who have abided by the request of the Senate Majority Leader to not meet with him. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how those senators reconcile that position back home -- they say I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do my job because the Republican leader in the Senate told me not to. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s a position that they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken thus far.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then just two quick questions about maybe some possible phone calls the President might make. \xc2\xa0Has he called anybody in the Clinton family to congratulate them on the newest addition to their family?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any calls like that, but obviously when the President heard the news about the birth of Chelsea Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s second child, he was obviously pleased to hear it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then secondly, with the Cleveland Cavaliers championship win last night, has the President called anybody at their organization? \xc2\xa0And does he intend to invite them to the White House before he leaves office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident the President is looking forward to the chance that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to congratulate the Cleveland Cavaliers on their world championship victory last night. \xc2\xa0The President obviously had a chance to watch the end of the game on Air Force One last night, and I would expect that in the next day or two he will be making a call either to the head coach or somebody in the front office in Cleveland to congratulate them on their victory and to invite them to the White House. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to schedule that visit before the President leaves office, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President is hoping we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to do that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In a little over two weeks, right after the Fourth of July break, the President is heading to Warsaw for the NATO summit. \xc2\xa0Notwithstanding what happens this week in the vote with Great Britain to withdraw from the EU, London being the second-largest and most powerful financial capital after New York, and other issues that are going on in Europe at the moment, what role will the President be playing and what are the major concerns the President has as he participates in the last NATO Summit of his administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about the outcome of the U.K. election later this week. \xc2\xa0So setting that aside, the President has valued the kind of close coordination that the United States has enjoyed with our NATO allies since the President took office. \xc2\xa0And one of his goals upon taking office, and I think one of his achievements upon leaving it, is succeeding in strengthening and deepening that alliance in a way that has a tangible impact, a positive one, on U.S. national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there certainly are a range of questions to be discussed at the NATO Summit. \xc2\xa0I would anticipate that there will be an ongoing discussion about the situation in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0Obviously, NATO has made a significant contribution to our efforts there, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pleased by the contribution -- by the impact that their contribution has made.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would anticipate that there will be continued discussion of the security situation in Europe, including the challenge presented by the flow of migrants into Europe. \xc2\xa0This obviously is not just a pretty desperate humanitarian situation, but this is a situation that has an impact on the security situation inside of Europe. \xc2\xa0And the President had the opportunity to discuss that situation with some of our European allies when he was last in Europe earlier this spring. \xc2\xa0I would anticipate that something like that would come up again.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there continues to be a unanimity of opinion in Europe about the importance of protecting the principle of sovereignty, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so many European nations stand with Ukraine as they confront repeated violations of their sovereignty by the Russians.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty on the agenda. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly have more of an opportunity to talk about it as that trip gets closer.</p>\n<p>\n\tLalit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Forty-eight members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group are meeting in Seoul tomorrow, and India has applied for its membership. \xc2\xa0The President has supported it. \xc2\xa0What are the expectations of the meeting tomorrow? \xc2\xa0And what is the message the U.S. is sending to these countries for the meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Lalit, the President did have an opportunity to discuss this issue with Prime Minister Modi when he was here at the White House a couple of weeks ago. \xc2\xa0The United States, as you know, strongly supports India\xe2\x80\x99s application to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group. \xc2\xa0We believe -- and this has been U.S. policy for some time -- that India is ready for membership. \xc2\xa0And the United States calls on participating governments to support India\xe2\x80\x99s application at the plenary later this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, participating governments will need to reach a consensus decision in order to admit any applicant into the group. \xc2\xa0And the United States will certainly be advocating for India\xe2\x80\x99s membership.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the U.S. reached out to this country or some of the countries who are opposing the membership?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any conversations to read out at this point. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve made our views known both publicly and privately, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do so in advance of the meeting this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hi. \xc2\xa0Okay, so going back to the Orlando 911 calls, is the White House at all concerned that redacting such large portions of the calls may help feed conspiracy theories that may be circulating?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a pretty blunt discussion of this situation. \xc2\xa0And these are decisions that are made by the Department of Justice and investigators at the FBI, and so we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to them to handle it.</p>\n<p>\n\tGardiner, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0I got a question from our foreign desk. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s an escalating crackdown on the political opposition -- the Sunni monarchy in Bahrain said Monday that it had revoked the citizenship of a top cleric who is regarded as a spiritual voice of the Shiite majority. \xc2\xa0This is obviously a crucial country for the United States. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s where we have a huge Navy that -- fleet is there. \xc2\xa0The United States has continued to encourage this monarchy to not be quite so tough on the Shia minority. \xc2\xa0Do you have a reaction to this, Josh?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Gardiner, I have to admit I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of this particular situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So I can get you a more specific response to it. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the President has regularly advocated for better protection of basic universal human rights, and the President believes that that is important not just because these are values that we hold dear in this country, but the President believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of countries around the world to organize themselves and to govern their country consistent with the recognition of these universal human rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut let me see if I can get you a more specific response to that particular situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You passed on this question before, but let me just rephrase it differently. \xc2\xa0Does firing a campaign manager by a nominee suggest there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem in the campaign?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the wide array of outside analysts who are closely monitoring the campaign weigh in on that decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one other thing. \xc2\xa0On the editing of the transcript of the calls, it was just sort of a strange thing there in that this is a state function. \xc2\xa0There is a very good state Sunshine Act in Florida. \xc2\xa0Presumably -- I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why you think that it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for the FBI, which clearly is taking the lead in the investigation, but for the FBI to step on what is a state function with this very good state open-records law in this immediate time. \xc2\xa0Because presumably that open-records law will allow these records to come out fairly quickly, no?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, this decision was made by the FBI, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident they did that consistent with their interpretation of the law. \xc2\xa0Obviously, their interpretation matters a lot because, as you pointed out, they\xe2\x80\x99re in charge of the investigation, they have the lead on the investigation. \xc2\xa0And this particular transcript obviously is central to that ongoing investigation. \xc2\xa0But for how they arrived at that conclusion I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0Enjoy the rest of your Monday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0END \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n<span style="font-size:1em; letter-spacing:0.01em; line-height:1.385em">2:40 P.M.
