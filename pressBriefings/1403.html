EST</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A few questions on health care, Robert.\xc2\xa0 The detail about a new rate authority to oversee and shoot down premium increases that are deemed to be unjustified, unreasonable -- how is that not big government, the feds getting into the business of regulating and shooting down rate increases?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Ben, you understand and you\'ve heard both the President, on numerous occasions, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services discuss unjustifiable rate increases by insurance companies that are experiencing profits and whose rate increases -- proposed rate increases greatly outstrip health care inflation.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody would consider what a state insurance commissioner would do to be regulating the increases, largely unjustifiable, for health insurance to be an intrusion in their lives, but in fact a help.\xc2\xa0 This is a process that we\xe2\x80\x99ll work through with the Secretary of Health and Human Services in order to ensure that the public has some protection against this, Ben.</p>\n<p>I think -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly seen a lot of the coverage around individuals that received those letters.\xc2\xa0 We know that this is not the first time, and I doubt it will be the last time -- unless we get comprehensive reform in place -- that people will see in the individual market rate increases near 40 percent.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the bigger picture, about the overall plan, would the President be willing to accept anything less ambitious than this?\xc2\xa0 In other words, is this a starting point or is this a minimum?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- well, look, I think this is a starting point.\xc2\xa0 I think this is what -- a series of ideas that relate to cost, that relate to insurance reforms, and that relate to coverage that the President would like to discuss on Thursday.</p>\n<p>But, Ben, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a starting point in as much -- in as much as Republicans come to Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with constructive proposals that they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to discuss.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the key to having a successful bipartisan approach to this legislation, and that is the willingness for both sides to sit down, discuss common approaches to dealing with the skyrocketing costs, to dealing with insurance abuses, and finding a way, as we have said, to take those good ideas and put them into legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if you get that kind of process the White House is willing to bend itself -- is willing to accept something less than what was put forward today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously the President believes that we have to do something on cost.\xc2\xa0 The President believes we have to do something about insurance reforms.\xc2\xa0 The President believes we have to do something about the millions of Americans that don\'t have health care coverage.\xc2\xa0 We are tremendously hopeful, which is why the President posted ideas of his on the White House Web site today.\xc2\xa0 We hope Republicans will post their ideas either on their Web site, or we\'d be happy to post them on ours, so that the American people could come to one location and find out the parameters of what will largely be discussed on Thursday.</p>\n<p>But I think what comes out of Thursday will be predicated on a willingness by both sides to sit down and have face-to-face discussions and look for that commonality.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what the American people want Democrats and Republicans to do in Washington.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last one on this.\xc2\xa0 For Americans who are tuning back into this, process perhaps for the first time in a while, can you explain how this gets done?\xc2\xa0 You\'ve got Democrats who are still divided over some of the key issues, about taxes and abortion language and so forth; Republicans are still saying start over.\xc2\xa0 So how do you take this plan and get it done?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the process is going to start -- well, it started today with our posting of ideas.\xc2\xa0 We hope that it continues before Thursday with Republicans putting out more of their ideas.\xc2\xa0 And then we\'re going to work this through on Thursday.</p>\n<p>I don\'t want to get ahead of a tactical legislative discussion, ahead of what the legislation might be, understanding that the President is hopeful that this is a broad discussion where good ideas can be incorporated.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions, one on health care and one on financial reg.\xc2\xa0 Dan said this morning that after Thursday that the proposal that was put online this morning was designed to overcome a Republican filibuster if one were to occur.\xc2\xa0 Is that not a sign that you\'re ready to support reconciliation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, look -- first of all, reconciliation, as you know, is a legislative vehicle that has been used on a number of occasions over the past many years.\xc2\xa0 In 2001, the $1.35 trillion tax cut that went through the Senate went through the very same way.\xc2\xa0 The tax cuts in 2003 -- $350 billion -- went through in a similar way.</p>\n<p>Again, I don\'t think the President wants to get ahead of Thursday\'s meeting.\xc2\xa0 I think we believe there can and should be a constructive discussion.\xc2\xa0 I do think the President believes there ought to be an up or down vote on health care.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just even what you\'re saying now in terms of talking about the history of reconciliation sounds like you\'re paving the way for the use of that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I just simply do that for anybody that is hearing this as a word or a legislative vehicle that may not previously understand its scope and its history.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just saying that you -- the President wants an up or down vote, is that a sign that if that doesn\'t happen reconciliation is the way to go?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think what that means is that we have seen in survey after survey that the American people want Republicans and Democrats to work together on health care reform.\xc2\xa0 That\'s our goal for Thursday.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s premature to get ahead of what happens on Friday before Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is that getting ahead after 13 -- how many months on this?\xc2\xa0 Why can\'t you say yes or no?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I answered Jeff\'s question, but, Helen, I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, you didn\'t.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t think it\'s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he for reconciliation or not?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The avenue exists if one wants to pursue it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he want to pursue it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t think it makes any sense to get ahead of what happens with the legislation on Friday before discussion on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it seemed like Dan got -- at least the signal this morning on the call, without saying -- I mean, he said you haven\'t decided whether or not to support it, but the direction seems moving that way with the comments about an up or down vote.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to get into prejudging the outcome of Thursday on Monday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Let me just ask the one financial reg question.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House -- would the White House consider having a consumer financial protection agency that is independent but is part of another regulator, or does it have to be a separate entity?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with NEC.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think obviously the elements of this are -- have to include the independent authority of a CFPA, whether it\'s housed in -- whether it\'s housed someplace I think is one thing, but does that -- does the office of the CFPA have the independent authority to act without the permission of wherever that is housed, I think that is what advocates on the consumer side, like Elizabeth Warren, have discussed as the appropriate authority with which to protect consumers and what\'s been envisioned.\xc2\xa0 I will double check with NEC, see if they have any other guidance.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Walk us through the best-case scenario, in your view, of Thursday -- the Republicans come, they have some ideas, you guys have some ideas, then what?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, hopefully, that -- look, each of these -- each of what I\'ve talked about, what the President has talked about, in terms of changes in cost, changes in insurance reform, changes in coverage, as well as fiscal impact, all of these sections will be discussed in detail at the meeting on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 I think envisioning if there are additional ideas that the Republicans have, that will cut costs for the American people.\xc2\xa0 If they\'ve got a plan to do that, they discuss it, and the President agrees that it should be added, that would be -- I think we would hope that out of the process on Thursday, that would be yet another Republican idea incorporated into the legislation that would be ultimately and later considered by Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would be -- you have the Senate bill, you have your list of fixes to it.\xc2\xa0 So it would be added to the list of fixes or changes?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not a parliamentarian, Jake.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You worked in the Senate.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which is why I\'m now here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t -- there are certainly people that can do the legislative counsel -- look, I think suffice to say if we can get, and the President believes we can, get people in the room to discuss these things to come to a broad agreement, that legislative tactics is not what is going to hold up good ideas on both sides merged together from becoming law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just in terms of expedience, I mean, the way that you guys -- theoretically, if nothing happens on Thursday, that is if there is no kumbaya moment, then you guys send the Senate bill to the House, the House passes it; then the fix goes through the Senate.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, you asked me what I envision was going to happen on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to -- before the end of your question -- dispense theoretically with nothing happening on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 I think that would be a prejudgment that I don\'t think --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fair enough.\xc2\xa0 But if something does happen, it would be added to the fix, is the idea?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not a parliamentarian.\xc2\xa0 I could seek some guidance from Legislative Counsel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s one other thing I wanted to ask about.\xc2\xa0 You guys have been talking a lot about how premiums are going up at the same time that insurance company profits are going up -- the President talked about it in his weekly address, Secretary Sebelius talked about it.\xc2\xa0 Some of the insurance companies that Sebelius mentioned in her report and the President mentioned in his weekly address are non-profits -- specifically in Rhode Island, Oregon, and Michigan -- that have been operating at a loss and are by definition regulated by the state and non-profits.\xc2\xa0 Why are they included in the same breath as groups like Anthem BlueCross, that are for-profit ventures?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with HHS on -- and I would direct you also to them -- on the report.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the notion of them in the breadth of making profits doesn\'t correlate to them because they\'re nonprofits.\xc2\xa0 I do think it is a demonstration, though, profit or nonprofit, we see what is happening to the cost of health care greatly outstripping health care increases as a result of health care inflation -- which health care inflation has always -- or in many ways over the past 15 or 20 years been greatly ahead of the average increases in normal cost of living.\xc2\xa0 What we\'re seeing now -- Anthem Blue Cross and others -- is something on an exponential magnitude of what we had seen in the past, even in that increase.</p>\n<p>So I think that\'s why the President felt strongly about including the authority for rate review, and I think that\'s why the American people want -- the American people want someone to be on their side looking into this.</p>\n<p>Dan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, based on the signals that you\'re getting from Republicans, does it appear that they\'re coming to that meeting willing to work with the White House, or resist this plan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Dan, I think this is largely -- I have not seen everything that everybody has said.\xc2\xa0 I saw the statement that Congressman Boehner put out.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that the product that comes out of Thursday is dependent upon the Republican willingness to come and discuss health care solutions and be open to ideas and ensuring that those ideas are passed on to the people in the form of a change in health care reform.</p>\n<p>I\'ve seen certainly comments where folks have said, we should go just to tell everybody why this is a bad idea.\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s great.\xc2\xa0 And I hope -- I just hope that the second page of the talking points that those guys -- that any individual would bring on that would be to list what you would do.</p>\n<p>We do know this, that health care, as we\'ve talked about, the price is skyrocketing; small businesses are dropping their coverage; some of them are going out of business; it\'s crippling families\' budgets.\xc2\xa0 We know what it\'s doing to the federal government\'s budgets.\xc2\xa0 Simply saying no, simply discussing why we oppose -- why some people oppose one idea without bringing to that table a series and set of solutions that will help the problem is not fulfilling a role in representative democracy that\'s intended through their representation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ve got a question on Iran.\xc2\xa0 Has there been any sign at all that China might be more willing to embrace sanctions in light of the IAEA report?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check with NSC.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard anything specifically on China.\xc2\xa0 Look, I do believe, Dan, that one of the\xc2\xa0 -- the IAEA report represents one of the clearest denunciations of what the Iranians have been working on.\xc2\xa0 It is a clear -- it is clear and concise in the ways in which the Iranian government has taken steps to conceal over many years what it\'s done.\xc2\xa0 And I think this continues the nations of the P5-plus-1 and members of the IAEA and quite frankly the greater international community in collectively bringing forward the notion that Iran continues to thumb its nose at its international obligations.</p>\n<p>The President has been clear, leaders in the IAEA and the P5-plus-1, our allies have been clear, that without a change in behavior the Iranian government faces necessary consequences.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working on that.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been -- we\'ve worked quite closely with the Chinese on the strongest sanctions that have ever gone through the Security Council in resolution 1847 [sic] dealing with North Korea.*</p>\n<p>So we believe strongly and I think the Chinese believe that an arms race either in the Middle East or an international arms race is in no way in their interests, particularly -- we certainly know that -- for what drives the Chinese economy, energy is a big part of it.\xc2\xa0 An arms race in the Middle East, which could clearly be touched off as a result of this, is not in the interests of anyone.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who would the race be with?\xc2\xa0 And why are you so hopeful about the summit coming up?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Helen, I think that, first and foremost, this is what a number -- we\'ve heard a number of people say:\xc2\xa0 "We\'d like to go through the President\'s plan with the President.\xc2\xa0 We\'d like to bring forward our ideas."\xc2\xa0 We\'re happy to host the venue -- a venue for that to happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has never taken a strong stand on most things and I think he doesn\'t come across that way.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why you\'ve lost so much time.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Helen, the President never believed that any of this would be easy, or that any of this would be fast.\xc2\xa0 This has been an issue that many Presidents for many decades have worked on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he never should have left it to Congress to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the founders included a legislative branch for a reason, and we have to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They also expect the President to have leadership and --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Helen, I don\'t think anybody would -- we would not be at the point where we are were it not for the continued leadership of the President asking that members of Congress work to get this done.</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on her question, how hopeful is -- and what are the chances, do you think, that a bill similar to the proposal the President put out today will be passed and signed into law?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President continues to be quite hopeful that we will get this done.\xc2\xa0 Again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the chances?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is it likely?\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\'s likely that it will be?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do think it\'s likely that we\'ll get health care reform done this year because I think that the price of failure for everybody involved is far greater than anything else.\xc2\xa0 But I\'ll say this, Chip, I think -- again, I want to stress that the effectiveness of Thursday will be predicated upon the willingness of those involved, Democrat and Republican, President and Republican member of Congress, to look at, fairly evaluate the ideas that each bring to that table, and if there\'s commonality, figure out a way to get that into the proposal.</p>\n<p>Now, if there -- again, as I said today, if you read in the paper that somebody says, "All I\'m coming to do is to make sure that the American people know that what the President has proposed is a bad idea" -- well, again, you\'re elected to Congress or you\'re elected to the presidency to propose new ideas and solutions for the problems that everyday Americans face every day.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we hope -- that\'s the constructive notion that we hope participants will bring to Thursday\'s event.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aren\'t the insurance companies sabotaging it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think we\'ve all, Helen, been struck by --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Raising prices beyond the pale?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll tell you what is amazing to read is when -- is when you take an insurance company that raises their rates 39 percent, like we saw in California, they\'re called out for raising their rates.\xc2\xa0 They say they\'re raising their rates because we don\'t have health care reform.\xc2\xa0 And then you figure out who has been pushing most against and funding the ads against health care, and you realize behind curtain number one are the same people that just jacked up rates.\xc2\xa0 I think that demonstrates probably as illustratively as anything why health care reform can\'t wait.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you talk to people on Capitol Hill, they say if it\'s likely that a bill similar to this is going to pass then it\'s likely that it\'s going to have to be done by reconciliation.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, to get something like this through, you\'ve got to do reconciliation.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But again, Chip, if what the President wanted to do was simply not listen and take that through the process, we would be having a discussion about the process, not about the event on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to hear people bring their ideas about how this will change costs, how this will increase coverage --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ve already heard what they\'re going to do.\xc2\xa0 I mean, as you mentioned, Boehner says this cripples the credibility of the summit.\xc2\xa0 McConnell yesterday characterized putting out a proposal like this as \xe2\x80\x9cramming\xe2\x80\x9d it down their throats.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t you already know -- isn\'t it already clear this is going to be political theater with each side digging in their heels?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can only hope that Mitch McConnell and John Boehner and all the other Republican participants who say they\'re serious about dealing with issues like health care reform, that are -- want to be serious about dealing with the issues that the American people have.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve pushed back greatly on this notion that they\'re the \xe2\x80\x9cparty of no.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 If they\'re not the \xe2\x80\x9cparty of no,\xe2\x80\x9d Thursday is a perfect venue to be the \xe2\x80\x9cparty of yes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing, the administration has gone to great lengths to make clear that jobs and the economy are job number one this year.\xc2\xa0 But once you get back into health care all that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be just overwhelmed by health care.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chip, I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s going to -- as far as the American people are concerned, health care is going to be priority number one, once it gets out there like this.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I\'ve got to tell you, Chip, I think the American people believe -- I certainly -- I know people in this building believe that Washington can and should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time; that we face -- look, if you just list the problems that we face -- getting the economy moving again; wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; health care; job -- I mentioned jobs -- education -- the American people want to believe, because they have to deal with multiple problems at one time, that Washington can and should be able to address multiple problems.\xc2\xa0 The only way we\'re actually going to be able to do that is if we set aside the talking points, get in a room, roll up our sleeves, and try to make progress.\xc2\xa0 If all we do --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- talking points on the Democratic side on Thursday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This goes for Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 What I\'ve said up here today, Chip, isn\'t just about the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 Democrats and the President have to be -- and I know on behalf of the President, that he\'s willing to listen to these ideas.\xc2\xa0 I think that that\'s the only way we\'re going to make progress on this.\xc2\xa0 And people will get to judge for themselves the willingness for everybody to be part of that progress.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you\'re bringing the Congressional Budget Office folks to the summit to sort of be able to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if they\'re coming, to be honest with you.\xc2\xa0 I know they were invited; I don\'t know whether or not -- I don\'t know whether or not they\'re going to be in the room for the event.\xc2\xa0 We will have OMB there.\xc2\xa0 I think it is safe to say -- you may have a longer question, but whatever happens is going to have to ultimately be costed out by CBO, understanding that because of the number of estimates that they\'ve made throughout this process we have fairly good guidance on what things cost.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I was just going to say, what is the cost of this new bill, which you guys described in this call as the Senate bill with some important changes?\xc2\xa0 So it\'s the Senate bill, we know how much that costs -- but with these changes, are you going to get the Congressional Budget Office to give a final estimate, or do you guys come up with your own?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I think it would be premature to go through that process prior to Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, cost is an important part of this, though.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, it\'s an important part of it.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ll have estimates on different sections that -- for the discussion.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think that CBO has costed out a number of differences --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you sent any of this specifically to CBO now, or today or no?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check with Nancy-Ann to see if -- I doubt that that paper has gone to CBO, per se.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, you\xe2\x80\x99ve called this -- you said it\'s a starting point, you said it\'s a posting of ideas.\xc2\xa0 Can we -- is this the President\'s health care plan?\xc2\xa0 Is this fair to say what was put out today -- now, I mean, I know we\'ve been through semantics before, you guys had your principles and the Senate -- this is now the President\'s health care bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is what the President is bringing to Thursday.\xc2\xa0 This is a product, though, of months of work in committees on the House and Senate side.\xc2\xa0 It incorporates Democratic and Republican ideas and it\'s a starting point for those discussions.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think -- we\'re hopeful that these will be -- these ideas will be added to by the good ideas Republicans will bring.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\'t it have been odd if the Republicans -- they\'ve been spending -- they spent six months saying this was a bad bill, the Senate bill and the House bill, and this is what you\'re bringing to the table.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\'t it have been odd if they didn\'t criticize it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, they don\'t believe this is a good bill, so if this is the -- you see, I mean, that\'s sort of where they\'re coming from.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, but, Chuck, this isn\'t a -- I don\'t think the President believed that on Thursday they weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to criticize the efforts that he\'s been working on for six months.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s not determinative -- that\'s not going to be what determines the outcome of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 There are six hours for Republicans to discuss with the President sitting there in the room what their ideas are, why they believe that an idea that they propose is a better policy idea than he has.\xc2\xa0 They can discuss both the merits of and the facts of those proposals.\xc2\xa0 If there\'s commonality we can -- we\'ll agree to those things.</p>\n<p>But I think your question actually is in many ways exactly what will determine the outcome of Thursday.\xc2\xa0 If the outcome of Thursday is -- or if the setup for Thursday is simply walking in there and saying, I don\'t support what you\'ve done, and there\'s nothing else to that, then I think the American people will be disheartened that Democrats and Republicans even sitting in the same room discussing the same subject are incapable of even having a discussion about what alternative ideas there are.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what\'s most important to this process, is the ability not just to discuss one person\'s ideas, but to discuss a range of concepts.</p>\n<p>And I -- Republicans have wanted this, Chuck, for months.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve wanted to get in the same room with the President, walk through his ideas and talk about why their ideas are better.\xc2\xa0 That\'s going to happen Thursday at 10:00 a.m.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This new idea for the health insurance rate commission, I guess my confusion is, is this a commission that would sort of be -- serve as a guide to the other states, to the 50 states that do the actual regulating?\xc2\xa0 Or is this supposed to be a regulatory agency with --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 This is a -- the Secretary in conjunction with states will develop a review process for unreasonable premium increases.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the states are still going to be the regulators?\xc2\xa0 The federal government is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously they\'re still going to have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- acting as a guidance counselor of sorts?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They\'re going to still have a big role in this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are state insurance commissioners that have some ability to change these.\xc2\xa0 Not everybody does.\xc2\xa0 But these can -- these will be looked at and evaluated in conjunction with the states, and then steps and measures can be taken.\xc2\xa0 Because again, Chuck, I think that -- I mean, we\'ve even seen it now with Anthem, that proposed the 39 percent increase, that they\'ve even put that increase on hold.\xc2\xa0 I think they understand that this was not a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I understand, but is this supposed to be a new federal regulatory agency?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not a new federal agency.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no new bureaucracy.\xc2\xa0 This will be done out of the Secretary\'s office in Health and Human Services.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Out of HHS?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll get -- I\'ll get Reid to walk you through some more --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, because that -- it\'s just a little confusing if this is a new agency.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, my question is on the meeting this week with the Business Roundtable.\xc2\xa0 And first of all I\'d like to know what members of the administration will be present at the meeting with the President?\xc2\xa0 And also, does he --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have that with me, but I can certainly try to find out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 And does he have a specific proposal for them, particularly on taxation of overseas earnings?\xc2\xa0 Multinationals in this group have been very vocal in their opposition to a rollback of deferral tax breaks.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President included in his budget the notion that if -- of rolling back the tax break that allows people to enjoy the benefits of moving jobs overseas.\xc2\xa0 That\'s likely going to be an area that -- I\'m sure there are those that will make their strong case for why they think there should be a tax benefit to that.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will make a case, has made a case, and it is in his budget a proposal that does not allow them to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it sounds like the message he\'ll be delivering on that front is a sort of, you know, we\'re doing this, and there\'s no --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President has long felt a fundamental unfairness in rewarding companies that are moving jobs overseas.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s the only thing that will be discussed.\xc2\xa0 Like any relationship --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What else will be --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we get closer to that, we\'ll get a chance to go through what the President will say.\xc2\xa0 I think, as in any good relationship, you\'re not going to agree on everything.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does the President regard his plan today as a compromise plan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\'s a compromise between what you have -- what you saw come out of the processes in both the House and the Senate, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, those are plans that Republicans nearly universally opposed.\xc2\xa0 Can you point to something in this plan today that you think Republicans might like?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s always been in -- there\'s always been concepts in the plan to allow people to purchase insurance across state lines.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what you hear most of all from their proposals -- Senate McCain in the campaign had a proposal to add those dependents onto your parents\' health care up to a certain age to allow for what is a gap in the uninsured based on when someone leaves the dependency of their parents and gets a job that provides health care.</p>\n<p>There are -- I don\'t know in this legislation -- or in this compendium of stuff, but legislation went through the process on the Hill, contained amendments, over 160 Republican amendments.\xc2\xa0 But again, Mark, this is a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they still voted against it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And inexplicably all those ideas weren\'t good enough.\xc2\xa0 I will say this, Mark:\xc2\xa0 This is a starting point.\xc2\xa0 This can be added to by the ideas that Republicans bring on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like your starting point is on the hundredth floor of a building and they wanted to start from scratch at the ground floor.\xc2\xa0 How do you reconcile that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if I can reconcile the analogy.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I will say this, we -- health care is not -- this isn\'t a subject that we started discussing at the federal level upon the election of the 44th President of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 We know there are people up on Capitol Hill that have been working on health care on the Republican side for several decades.</p>\n<p>Understand that the starting point of what the President has put forward is a proposal that was endorsed by, and mirrors quite a bit, a proposal put out by Bob Dole and Howard Baker along with Tom Daschle.\xc2\xa0 Again, two of the three of those individuals just happen to be Republicans.\xc2\xa0 The notion of -- the notion of starting over after decades and decades of discussing this problem is not -- is not what the American people want.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, in the health proposal today there is a new tax on unearned income.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering, would retirement income be exempt from the Medicare tax --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get -- let me get Reid and Nancy-Ann to walk you through some of the specifics of that.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also on health care, the governors have complained that they\'re not at the table.\xc2\xa0 Are they -- is there an invitation for them to be there Thursday, or a representative for them?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously they\'ve got representatives.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thursday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, members of Congress represent the interest of both their districts and their larger state.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They have specifically asked that the NGA be there --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if the NGA will be in the room.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, I can\'t imagine that if a governor from X state didn\'t have a concern -- that had a concern that it can be birthed by any number of people attending the meeting on either side.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question, on the schedule is a private meeting with the governor of California.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be appealing for federal help to help pull that state\'s --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If I\'m not mistaken, I think that meeting is either going on now, or happened before I came out here.\xc2\xa0 We will get a readout on what the President talked about in that meeting.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure that Governor Schwarzenegger will discuss what he brought up with the President.</p>\n<p>Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Republicans are saying that the proposal that the government have more authority to deal with excessive rate increases suggests a lack of confidence in the overall reform\'s ability to bring down the costs of health care.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, understand that our proposal, there\'s a time in which exchanges will be set up.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s a time in which we want to ensure that rate increases aren\'t slipped through as a part of the gap between when a bill is signed into law and when those exchanges are up and regulating price increases.\xc2\xa0 Again, the insurance company that proposed increasing by 39 percent said their proposal to increase was because we lacked health care reform.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t -- it\'s hard to -- it would be hard to reconcile the notion that having health care reform didn\'t have confidence in doing this since they said the lack of health care reform is what caused -- purportedly caused such a sharp increase.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No provision that I see here to accommodate the Republicans call for medical malpractice reform.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, first and foremost, the President and the Secretary of Health and Human Services use the authority -- regulatory authority that had existed for years to set up demonstration projects in states regarding medical malpractice.\xc2\xa0 And look, Wendell, I think it\'s an area which will probably be addressed in the very first section of what\'s discussed on Thursday, and I think the President is anxious to discuss it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President expects Republicans to bring that to the table on Thursday.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have read that, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does he have an open mind about it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another issue, on Friday Rashad Hussain said, "I made statements to the panel" -- in \'04 the White House has defended his appearance at -- "that I now recognize were ill-conceived, not well-formulated," this in reference to a man convicted of supporting -- or raising money for a terrorist organization.\xc2\xa0 Were you misled?\xc2\xa0 Do you maintain confidence in this man the President wants to be his delegate to the Islamic conference?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We continue to have confidence.\xc2\xa0 The statement says that the judicial process has concluded and that he has full faith in the outcome of that judicial process.\xc2\xa0 This is an individual that has written extensively on why you have -- why some have used religious devices like the Quran to justify this, and why that is absolutely wrong, and has garnered support from both the left and the right.\xc2\xa0 So we continue to obviously have confidence.</p>\n<p>Anne.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say that med-mal is going to be discussed in the first section on Thursday, is there a structure in place that you can tell us about?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, if I\'m not mistaken -- and I don\'t have it in front of me -- but I think one of the first sections will be a discussion on cost, and I presume that\'s where discussions on medical malpractice, as it relates to cost, will be discussed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how soon after Thursday are you going to know whether it succeeded?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are you going to know on Friday if there are House votes to actually pass this in some form, or is it --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether there\'s -- I don\'t know whether -- look, I think we\'ll be able to evaluate to some degree on Thursday whether there\'s been a discussion first and foremost that included more ideas to the table.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\'ll have a chance to see agreement on -- hopefully agreement on some of those ideas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will this be the last opportunity for Republicans to bring new ideas?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, this has -- I assume you\'re factoring into that the committee process that included 160 Republican amendments as part of this process.\xc2\xa0 Republicans have been involved in every stage of this.</p>\n<p>Peter.\xc2\xa0 You\'re good?\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 In the past week, John Brennan, your counterterrorism expert, has been under fire for remarks he made in an interview in which he likened the criminal release in the United States and the U.S. penal system to that of the detainees in the war on terror returned to the battlefield, saying 20 percent is not that bad.\xc2\xa0 Senator Graham and Senator Bond criticized this and said he should be fired.\xc2\xa0 What\'s his status right now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He was here at work early on behalf to the American people keeping them safe and secure.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s understand for a second that -- I don\'t know what Senator Graham or Senator Bond said in 2005 when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made an analogy that if you compared the recidivism rate of detainees at Guantanamo with the U.S. penal system, the detainee rate is less for -- the recidivism rate is less for Guantanamo detainees.</p>\n<p>I know in your reporting that the next thing you\'ll talk about is the fact that John said that any recidivism is too much.\xc2\xa0 And it is why we have taken the time to evaluate those that remain at Guantanamo, to ensure that those that are transferred or -- that those that are transferred either through a court order or by other means, that there is a plan in place for their -- for the safety and security of those around them.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, of the Republican health care points that they have put out on the Internet, has the President read those?\xc2\xa0 Any Republican points, things that the President could accept?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think up on our Web site is a list of Republican ideas.\xc2\xa0 I know the President has gotten from folks here a list of -- a compilation of Republican ideas in the past. I\'d be happy to print for the President -- if Republicans have posted the ideas that they\'re going to bring to the meeting on Thursday, I\'d be more than happy to print that document and I\'d walk it into the Oval Office this afternoon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They haven\xe2\x80\x99t done that yet?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t -- I don\'t know if they\'ve posted -- I don\'t know if what they\'ve -- again, we\'d be happy to host the posting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so far the White House hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything out of all those Republican ideas that you think you might embrace?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything in anything the Republicans have put forward that you think you might embrace?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I think that\'s a good point to be left for Thursday.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- again, there are ideas that Republicans have proposed, including the sale of insurance across state lines.\xc2\xa0 Now, I will admit that we have added into our legislation a minimum set of standards to ensure that somebody that\'s seeking a policy isn\'t fooled by a policy that may sound too good to be true and in fact becomes too good to be true.</p>\n<p>So there\'s a minimum set of insurance standards that would apply to that sale.\xc2\xa0 But there are Republican ideas already and I think the President looks forward to hearing and discussing more.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one of the things the President has done is he\'s laid down these predicates for the meeting, saying, I\'m willing to listen to any ideas so long as they -- and then he ticks off his goals -- expands coverage, reduces costs, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans don\'t share his goal of expanding coverage to 30 million or universal.\xc2\xa0 Is he coming into this meeting with an open mind on bedrock issues like that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has an open mind and is happy to hear proposals and ideas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even if they don\'t meet his long-stated goals?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Understand, Mara, I don\'t -- I\'ve been asked a number of times, would the President just sign anything, be able to call it reform, and then run around saying we did reform?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think -- we\'ve got, depending on which figure you use, 35-36 million people in this country that don\'t have access to affordable health care insurance.\xc2\xa0 The President has I think important and strong views on ensuring that that number, the number that we cover, is as high as it can be, because understanding -- we hear a lot about the cost of health care.\xc2\xa0 Well, it costs us in higher premiums each and every time somebody without health insurance gets in a car accident, gets sick, and has to go to the emergency room for treatment.</p>\n<p>You\'ve heard Governor Schwarzenegger talk about this a lot because in the largest state that happens because of the large number of uninsured.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a couple of technical questions.\xc2\xa0 On reconciliation, is there any -- when you mentioned things that have been passed using reconciliation in the past, is there any reason you left welfare reform off the list?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I just -- I think there\'s an expansive list that goes back many years.\xc2\xa0 The point I was making was simply that I think if you listen to some talk about it now, you would -- it makes it seem as if it\'s a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence; that I assume if you matched up what people say about that and some of their votes on that, it might appear different.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on reconciliation, is it your understanding that the authority to use the reconciliation process is indefinite or does it run out at a certain point this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would check with -- let me check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I just have one other --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I pled lack of parliamentary understanding earlier on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other quick thing about CBO, just to follow up on Chuck\'s question.\xc2\xa0 The President has often said when he\'s talked about specific Republican proposals that the CBO has scored them in a certain way where they don\'t cover very many people or they don\'t add up to the deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And that -- and he\'s really looked to the CBO to provide credibility for these proposals.\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\'t you submit this in advance so that you can come on Thursday and say what exactly it\'s been scored as?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Mara, understanding the base for the proposal that the President put online today is the Senate bill.\xc2\xa0 That obviously has gone through -- that has gone through so many machinations at the CBO --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then that should be easy for them to give you a little update by Thursday.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, and I think because of the amount of scoring that we\'ve done, you can come to a pretty good estimate on that prior to doing that.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t -- Mara, I don\'t think what we lack for Thursday is a CBO score on the President\'s starting point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, they\'re going to come in and say that it doesn\'t actually do the things he says it does.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand that, but, again, the number -- so many of these proposals have been evaluated by the Congressional Budget Office.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not as if this is something out of newly whole cloth.\xc2\xa0 These are things that have been discussed, evaluated, and judgment rendered on, on, quite frankly, both sides of the aisle.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the White House bill eliminates the special Medicaid treatment for Nebraska, but it appears to leave in the funds that were secured by Senator Landrieu for Louisiana, as well as the special Medicare Advantage treatment that was obtained by Senator Nelson of Florida.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m just wondering, how did the White House decide with these carve-outs which to do away with, which to include?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on the latter one.\xc2\xa0 On the former one, this is an FMAP proposal that governs any state with which the President has declared a major disaster.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not a carve-out for; in fact, it covers -- potentially covers any state with which, as I said a minute ago, the President has declared how that health care relates to a major disaster.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 A couple questions, first, the President\'s proposal did include the individual mandate.\xc2\xa0 And many Republicans -- Orrin Hatch and others -- have said that that\'s not constitutional.\xc2\xa0 Will the White House have any sort of legal analysis explaining why that is constitutional?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard anybody discuss the constitutionality of that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t pretend to be a lawyer, but this is a concept that has been around for quite some time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, this is non-health care related.\xc2\xa0 But John Boehner, speaking earlier this month about the Faith-Based Council member Harry Knox, said -- I\'m quoting him -- "We can\'t have in the White House an anti-Catholic bigot, and that\'s what this gentleman appears to be."\xc2\xa0 He was referring to Mr. Knox\'s comment that the Pope had --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- not surprisingly, I do not have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 I\'d be happy to have one of these guys take a look at it.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I wanted to clarify, you talked earlier about the regulation of the insurance rates being set up to stop -- I think you said to stop insurance companies from racing through rate increases before these exchanges are set up.\xc2\xa0 Will this rate authority be temporary, then?\xc2\xa0 Will it sunset when the exchanges start?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get Reid and Nancy-Ann to give you -- to walk you guys through some of that.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think our strong belief is that it would be redundant authority at -- after which we get health care reform implemented.</p>\n<p>David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 On health care, on the excise tax, House Democrats still are very opposed to this.\xc2\xa0 Nancy Pelosi, a few weeks ago, said there was absolutely no support for it, even if -- even if the Senate form was tweaked.\xc2\xa0 So have you spoken to House Democrats about the particulars in the President\'s proposal on that front?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, David, I think they were briefed on Capitol Hill after we had a briefing call this morning.\xc2\xa0 I know that they\'re -- I\'ve seen the Speaker say that they\'re going to discuss some of the outlines of what the President has put up on the Internet this afternoon and this evening.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, back to the stimulus.\xc2\xa0 Last week, many Republicans put out statements that the stimulus has created absolutely no new jobs, as you know.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, Governor Schwarzenegger said that it created 120,000 or so in his own state.\xc2\xa0 And just a few moments ago, Governor Crist, said it had led to the creation or maintenance of 87,000 jobs in Florida.\xc2\xa0 All that said, do you believe that Republicans here in Washington are purposefully lying about the stimulus?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t actually believe that they believe their own statements.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, I used the example last week of Eric Cantor said -- Eric Cantor said that it has created no jobs, but when it came time to apply for high-speed rail funds, he said it would create jobs.\xc2\xa0 Now, speaking of reconciliation, I don\'t have the slightest idea how one reconciles what one says in Washington and what one says in their district when they seem to be in such contradiction.</p>\n<p>Whether it\'s Governor Schwarzenegger, whether it\'s Governor Crist, whether it\'s Mark Zandi, who was the chief economic advisor to John McCain\'s presidential campaign --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not the chief --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doug Holtz was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he is a Democrat, Zandi is, so --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t -- I hope you\'re not saying that party affiliation would change the economic analysis that one goes through.\xc2\xa0 Democrat or Republican, he was an advisor to the McCain campaign and has said jobs were created and economic growth has happened.</p>\n<p>You watch Republicans continue to sort of trip over themselves to both put out a statement for -- on why this hasn\'t worked, at the same time hoping desperately that someone will read their letter for money to come to their district so it will add to what\'s working already there as part of the Recovery Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if they\'re playing that sort of game on the stimulus, how can you expect to make any progress with them on health care reform?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because the President will be in the room, and I think if somebody makes -- were to make an argument as out of the blue as that, I think there\'s somebody there who would have an alternative viewpoint on that.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions.\xc2\xa0 Governor Paterson was outside and he said that he\'s going to be involved in conversations today on the expected KSM trial.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk to me about what this conversation is (inaudible), who is it with, and what his conversations have been with the President and Eric Holder?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I did not see his statement out there.\xc2\xa0 I will have NSC check and see if -- who they\'re having discussions with.\xc2\xa0 My sense is there are -- well, without prejudging what he might say, obviously we have heard from the police chief and the mayor and the like of both security and logistical concerns for a trial there.\xc2\xa0 Those are being looked at and evaluated.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there is money in the budget for trials.\xc2\xa0 So I assume that he\'s coming to express monetary reservations relating to that, and I\'ll certainly see what those are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the President has his hand involved in this, has he reached out to Governor Paterson personally to talk about this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They may have -- I don\'t know if they talked about it last night.\xc2\xa0 My guess is no.\xc2\xa0 I was -- I don\'t know whether that happened last night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then on black farmers, there\'s a concern that this March 31st deadline will not happen.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re saying that the only way that these black farmers will get this $1.25 billion that they\'re due for this long settlement is that if the President steps in and stands by it as well as other Democrats on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 Is the President expected and will he step in and say, "I support these farmers" and push it through before the March 31st deadline?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you all saw the statement the President put out at the end of the week based on the proposed settlement.\xc2\xa0 You could see the President supports that settlement.\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the deadline concerns, but we\'ll ask Ag or others to address that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, the President has put out a statement, and so have many others, but there is a concern with the political climate right now and with deficits that this is going to go another term, possibly to another President if this President does not put his self into this and help push it through before --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Once again, let me talk with him specifically.\xc2\xa0 My sense is that the President has put out a fairly strong statement in support of this.</p>\n<p>Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry if this has already been addressed, but can you explain why in this detailed health care proposal the President and his team did not include a public option?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it has been asked; I think it might have been asked this morning.\xc2\xa0 Sam, the President has put forward a proposal that is based on the Senate plan with some, as you all have heard in here, some modifications to that, and as the best way forward into something that can ultimately wind its way through Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what do you think of the 20 or so senators who have now signed a letter asking for this to be passed through reconciliation?\xc2\xa0 Is that a waste of --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think they\'ve asked for a vote on the floor of the Senate and that\'s certainly up to those who manage those amendments and to Leader Reid.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question on Haiti and then one on health care reform.\xc2\xa0 There are ships carrying heavy equipment and aid that are being held at the ports of Port-au-Prince and Saint-Marc and they can\'t unload because people are demanding payoffs.\xc2\xa0 What is the U.S. doing to monitor the situation?\xc2\xa0 And once the airports are turned over back to the Haitians, what will you do to monitor the situation there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me have NSC -- I\'m not familiar with that transaction, but we will have NSC look into that for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on preexisting conditions, for a while you were talking about preexisting conditions just being for children.\xc2\xa0 Have you gone back to preexisting conditions being for everybody, for adults, too, now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, preexisting -- barring an insurance company from discriminating on behalf or on the basis of a preexisting condition -- when the bill was immediately signed into law, that protection would go in immediately for those children.\xc2\xa0 What then is -- for the greater population, that phases in after the signing of the bill.\xc2\xa0 So we have supported then and continue to support now doing away with insurance companies being able to discriminate on the basis of any preexisting condition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But for adults it won\'t kick in immediately.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It won\'t kick in immediately, right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Lieberman is now planning to introduce a "don\'t ask, don\'t tell" repeal bill next week.\xc2\xa0 Would the President like to see Congress pass repeal this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, as you know, the President is strongly in support of this, working with Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen.\xc2\xa0 There is a process that\'s underway.\xc2\xa0 You saw in Admiral Mullen the first joint chair to openly -- active joint chair to openly call for its repeal.</p>\n<p>We have stated throughout this process that the only durable way for this to happen is through legislation.\xc2\xa0 We think that Senator Lieberman\'s proposal is obviously an important step in that legislation.\xc2\xa0 And I would point out that you heard from commanders in the field over the weekend on news shows as well as former Chairman Powell also come out strongly in support of repealing "don\'t ask, don\'t tell."</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot of people fear that if it doesn\'t happen this year that it very well may not happen throughout the entire first term, not just in the second one.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the President shares that because I believe, and I think you all have seen this throughout, obviously there has been a lot of public polling on this done since the President\'s proposal and since Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen testified on Capitol Hill about this.\xc2\xa0 There is strong bipartisan support for its repeal among the American people.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously shares that, as do important members of the military.\xc2\xa0 And we think it will become law.</p>\n<p>Thank you, all.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n1:32 P.M.
