Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>11:52 A.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for your patience.\xc2\xa0 I have a couple of quick announcements.\xc2\xa0 As you may have seen already, President Obama is announcing his intent to nominate three members of the National Labor Relations Board -- Mark Gaston-Pearce to serve another term as member and to be designated chairman.\xc2\xa0 And then, Harry I. Johnson, III and Philip Miscimarra both to be members of the NLRB.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThese nominations -- if all, including the two that we\xe2\x80\x99ve nominated prior, are acted on by the Senate -- would bring the NLRB up to full operating level, ensuring that it continues to function and fulfill its responsibilities to look after workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This would be a bipartisan board.\xc2\xa0 The two nominees, Harry Johnson and Philip Miscimarra, are Republican nominees and you would have a balanced, bipartisan board, and we urge the Senate to move on those nominations efficiently.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSeparately, I\xe2\x80\x99d also like to say that this afternoon the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Patty Shwartz to the Third Circuit.\xc2\xa0 Judge Shwartz was reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 8, 2012, making her way to 397 days for what should be a bipartisan confirmation vote.\xc2\xa0 After her expected confirmation, there will still be 14 other judicial nominees awaiting floor votes.\xc2\xa0 Of these 14, 13 were approved by the Judiciary Committee unanimously, and five nominees would fill judicial emergencies.\xc2\xa0 They have been waiting on the Senate floor for an average of 67 days for a vote.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s nearly twice as long as President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s judicial nominees.\xc2\xa0 We urge the Senate to move on these nominees without further delay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJulie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 North Korea is urging all foreigners to evacuate South Korea, saying that the two countries are on the verge of a nuclear war.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. take this latest threat seriously in any way?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think that this is just more bluster?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s statement advising foreigners to make plans to evacuate Seoul is more unhelpful rhetoric that serves only to escalate tensions.\xc2\xa0 This kind of rhetoric will only further isolate North Korea from the international community and we continue to urge the North Korean leadership to heed President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s call to choose the path of peace and to come into compliance with its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 We have seen this kind of bellicose rhetoric, these kinds of provocative statements consistently -- obviously, in recent days and weeks -- but also as part of a pattern of behavior that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the years from the North Korean leadership.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe end result of this kind of behavior has only been to further isolate North Korea from the rest of the world and to do harm to the North Korean people.\xc2\xa0 The North Korean leadership would be wiser to focus on developing its economy and assisting the North Korean people, who suffer under this kind of leadership that chooses development of missile programs and nuclear weapons rather than the feeding of its own people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether related to this latest statement or just more broadly the situation there, are there any discussions happening within the administration about revising any travel warnings for Americans in South Korea?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, travel warnings are issued by the State Department, so that\xe2\x80\x99s your best source for information on that.\xc2\xa0 In general, again, we are taking prudent measures in response to the stepped-up rhetoric and actions by the North Koreans.\xc2\xa0 Those have been reported on -- some of the flights that we flew, the repositioning of missile defense, assets, and the like.\xc2\xa0 So those actions continue to be taken and to ensure both the defense of the homeland, as well as our allies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on a separate topic, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a protest outside the White House shortly with several liberal groups and a couple of lawmakers who are going to be delivering a petition.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re upset about some of the positions the President has taken in his upcoming budget and on other issues.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that the President may be alienating some of his liberal allies, particularly those who were such a crucial part of his reelection?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget represents a good-faith attempt to reach a deal with Congress that would achieve this President\xe2\x80\x99s number-one objective, which is economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 That has to be the first priority of everyone in Washington who\xe2\x80\x99s focused on our budget issues.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat his budget proves -- will prove, when you see it tomorrow -- is that you can invest in our economy, protect our seniors, make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re making crucial investments in areas like infrastructure, education, and innovation that help our economy grow in the future, and responsibly reduce our deficit.\xc2\xa0 We need to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the number-one objective.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have come a long way since the depths of the Great Recession, but we have a long way to go.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve created 6.5 million private sector jobs -- the United States of America, the American people have -- since we emerged from the recession.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSince the depths of the recession, we have emerged to create 6.5 million private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 We have seen quarter after quarter of positive economic growth, but we are a long way from where we need to be.\xc2\xa0 We need to move forward through a budget process that ensures that we protect the middle class; provide ladders of opportunity to those who aspire to the middle class; that we invest in education, and infrastructure, and innovation; and that we, as part of a broad budget approach, continue to reduce our deficit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI know you know, Julie, because you\xe2\x80\x99ve been here, the President signed into law $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction thus far, and he\xe2\x80\x99s done it in a way that has allowed our economy to continue to grow, despite some of the disruptions we\xe2\x80\x99ve faced because of recalcitrance on Capitol Hill by Republicans, most notably in the summer of 2011.\xc2\xa0 But we have more work to do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget were to become law, that would include not just the measures that allow for economic growth and job creation, but in concert with that, an additional $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, bringing the total to $4.3 trillion.\xc2\xa0 That in turn would -- for the wonks out there -- create a deficit to GDP ratio under 3 percent, which is what economists say we need to stabilize our debt.\xc2\xa0 All of this is part of a broad, holistic approach to our budget challenges.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does that mean you\xe2\x80\x99re not concerned about the worries of some allies?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think Democrats and allies understand that this budget the President will put forward tomorrow is not his ideal budget.\xc2\xa0 It is a document that recognizes that to achieve a bipartisan solution to our budget challenges we need to make tough choices.\xc2\xa0 It demonstrates, in stark contrast to the House Republican budget, that you can invest in our economy and protect our middle class and protect our seniors, and reduce the deficit.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go the route of Chairman Ryan, which is to eviscerate or devastate programs that help the middle class, block grant, and eviscerate or slice down Medicaid, so that families that rely on Medicaid, including families who have children who are disabled, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to voucherize Medicare and shift thousands of dollars of cost annually onto vulnerable seniors just to reduce the deficit.\xc2\xa0 And you certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t need to give $5.7 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest of Americans and then pay for it by all these cuts to programs that help the middle class.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere is a better way.\xc2\xa0 There is a balanced way, and that\'s the way the President will put forward tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Baucus is saying that he wants to produce a tax reform plan by August.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that\'s included in the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision for a grand bargain on the deficit?\xc2\xa0 Does it include comprehensive tax reform?\xc2\xa0 And is he interested in making reforms to the individual tax code as well as the corporate tax code?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the outlines of the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget have gotten out, but I will urge you to wait until tomorrow, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have just a day-long budget-palooza filled with details for you to examine.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the fact is the President\xe2\x80\x99s balanced approach to deficit reduction does include revenues through tax reform, closing of loopholes, and capping of deductions -- very much in the manner that Speaker Boehner proposed late last year.\xc2\xa0 The difference being that, at least now anyway, the President believes we need to take the savings from that, the revenue generated from tax reform, and apply it to deficit reduction rather than turning it into tax cuts for the wealthy and well-connected.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that is tax reform, and that will be part of our budget.\xc2\xa0 But for the details of that I would urge you to wait until tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us about the dinner planned for tomorrow night?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as was the case the first time the President had dinner with a dozen Republican senators, this will be a private dinner where the President looks forward to discussing a range of subjects, including, of course, budget and fiscal matters, but also immigration reform and the effort to pass common-sense legislation to reduce gun violence and other issues, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.</p>\n<p>He looks forward to this.\xc2\xa0 As I think you know, Senator Isakson took on the task of compiling the invitation list, and I would refer you to his office or to the individual senators\xe2\x80\x99 offices to ask about who is attending.\xc2\xa0 We won\xe2\x80\x99t put that out, but it\xe2\x80\x99s up to them to say whether or not they\'re attending, or to Senator Isakson to decide whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99ll put out his list.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis will be, hopefully, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, the same kind of constructive conversation that he had the first time with a different group of senators.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that there is a common-sense caucus in Washington that embraces the idea that compromise requires moving off of your absolutist positions, accepting that you don\'t get everything you want; that ideological purity is not achievable legislatively when you have a divided government as we do in Washington.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\'s what the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget embodies.\xc2\xa0 And he knows -- because he\xe2\x80\x99s had conversations with Republican senators who have expressed this -- that there is at least an element of the Republican conference in the Senate that believes that bipartisan compromise is possible on a whole range of issues, including budget issues.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping to continue that conversation, and he hopes it will be productive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be here or outside?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it has been reported that it will be at the White House, and that is correct, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBrianna.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is he going to make a direct appeal at that dinner tomorrow for some Republican senator there to allow debate on gun legislation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\'t predict.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no script.\xc2\xa0 But I think as you heard last night when the President was in Hartford, Connecticut, he feels very passionately about the obligation of each individual senator to allow a vote on each of the components of these gun violence measures.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt would be a shame, as he said, that those who applauded the idea that every one of these measures should have a vote in honor of Gabby Giffords, or the children of Newtown, or the victims of Aurora, those senators who applauded in January at the State of the Union address hopefully will, in keeping with their applause then, not take any action to try to hide behind procedural measures to avoid a vote.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf they are opposed to background checks, they should stand up and say so, and vote no.\xc2\xa0 The American people demand at least that.\xc2\xa0 They elected members of the Senate to vote.\xc2\xa0 That is their principal job.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what they get paid for.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t get paid to block votes.\xc2\xa0 They get paid to vote and to make decisions about what they believe is right or wrong for the country.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd if they think background checks, for example -- that 90 percent of the American people support -- are wrong, if they\'re with the 10 percent, they ought to stand by their convictions, but explain why.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, there is a difference between saying that in a speech and sitting over a dinner table and personally --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I don\'t think the President will be shy about expressing his views on this matter.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you there\xe2\x80\x99s not a script, so I can\'t guarantee the direction of the conversation.\xc2\xa0 But I can assure you that the need to make progress on legislation that is very common-sense, that is supported in each of its components by a majority of the American people, will be a topic of conversation.\xc2\xa0 It will certainly be something the President wants to discuss.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on this issue of this Florida couple who allegedly abducted their children from their grandparents, who had custody of the kids, and are now apparently in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 CNN has now, it appears, seen and spoken to the father of the children --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of this story.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have CNN tuned on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re aware of the story, though.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re aware of the story of the Florida couple?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Just a little bit.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the U.S. be demanding that Cuba turn over the family?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question, Brianna.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Ann.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On the gun legislation, is the President reaching out at all to Senator Manchin or Senator Toomey?\xc2\xa0 Does he hold out hope that some kind of language on the actual background checks could be reached?\xc2\xa0 And in his talks with the Newtown parents, would background checks have made any difference in Newtown?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with the first part.\xc2\xa0 The President and his team here at the White House is actively engaged -- or the President and his team are actively engaged in the effort to work with those members of the Senate who are trying to forge bipartisan compromise on the various components of the gun legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s up there.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific conversations to read out, but we are obviously continuing to work with members of the Senate.\xc2\xa0 We remain hopeful that bipartisan compromise can be achieved.\xc2\xa0 We remain insistent that legislation be voted on and not blocked through filibuster or other procedural measures or manners.\xc2\xa0 But we are engaged in this process from the top down.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat the President has said about and said again last night about the comprehensive set of proposals that he put forward in January is that, even if they all pass, we would not eliminate all violent acts using firearms.\xc2\xa0 There would still be gun violence in America, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question.\xc2\xa0 But it is incumbent upon those lawmakers who were sent here by their constituents and incumbent upon the President and the Vice President who were elected by the entire country to do whatever they can that is sensible and common-sense that will reduce gun violence; that will save the lives of children like the children of Newtown.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt won\xe2\x80\x99t eliminate the problem, but the problem needs to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 We need to reduce the number of these horrific events and the number of the often unreported or little reported events that take the lives of so many Americans every day of the week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMajor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to take up something that was discussed last week that I think you might want to clarify, because there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of reporting on it.\xc2\xa0 When the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget comes out it will replace the sequester.\xc2\xa0 There are Republican contentions that the net deficit reduction will only therefore be $600 billion, and there were those who concluded from your briefing last week that you said as much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you walk us through the math, as the White House sees it, on net deficit reduction, how the sequester is replaced, and what the budget will say about 10-year deficit reduction numbers?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The budget will say about 10-year deficit reduction numbers that if the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget is enacted, it will reduce the deficit by $1.8 trillion.\xc2\xa0 Added to the $2.5 trillion that\xe2\x80\x99s already been signed into law by the President, that brings us -- even for those of us who didn\xe2\x80\x99t go far in math -- to $4.3 trillion.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s budget will replace the sequester, which was designed to be bad policy for everyone with not just $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction, but $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 In other words, it will go further than the sequester.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, if the proposition is that the sequester is policy that we want to embrace, I encourage members of Congress to stand up and say so -- that they believe in the defense cuts; that they believe in the fact that there are no entitlement savings; that they believe in the across-the-board, indiscriminate nature of the sequester, which was designed by Congress to force Congress to do its job.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI mean, it was an admission by Congress, essentially, or at least posited by those who designed it, that we would design the sequester to reduce the deficit in an arbitrary, indiscriminate way because it is our job, members of Congress, to do it in a thoughtful way, to do it in the best possible way in terms of policy.\xc2\xa0 So the whole proposition has been, as you know, Major, since you covered it, since the summer of 2011, to achieve further deficit reduction not through the sequester but through better policy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget does.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it your contention that when we look at the numbers tomorrow, what we will see is $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that is composed of $600 billion in new revenue and $1.2 trillion in spending cuts?\xc2\xa0 And interest that is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Roughly, that is the breakdown.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s more than 2 to 1, as is the case with the President\xe2\x80\x99s overall $4.3 trillion in deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 More than $2 of that deficit reduction -- for every dollar in revenue, more than $2 of it comes in spending cuts.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget tomorrow -- again, I urge you to examine the details when it is put out -- there will be revenue achieved through tax reform, closing of loopholes, and capping of deductions that go to the well-off and well-connected, and that will produce revenue.\xc2\xa0 I think as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, the offer the President made to Speaker Boehner is incorporated within the budget.\xc2\xa0 That offer included roughly $580 billion in revenue gleaned from tax reform, capping of deductions, and closing of loopholes.\xc2\xa0 That will be included in the budget.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe rest will come from savings elsewhere in the budget, including through entitlement reforms that we\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed and we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, and including those that were in the Boehner offer, the offer to the Speaker of the House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt will also include entirely paid-for measures that demonstrate our need to invest in our economy so that it grows and it creates jobs.\xc2\xa0 Because if there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that I think economists of all stripes would agree on, it is that we cannot reduce our deficit effectively if our economy is not growing.\xc2\xa0 We need to make sure that we take a balanced approach that allows us to continue to invest so that our middle class is expanding and our economy is creating jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are many things we don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the budget, but one of the things we don\xe2\x80\x99t know is how the administration intends to protect those it only describes as most vulnerable from the superlative CPI or chained CPI alteration the President is now embracing.\xc2\xa0 Is it your message to those who will soon be protesting here at the White House that they will be pleasantly surprised when they see the contours of these specifics?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t speak for them.\xc2\xa0 I think in some of the reporting on this, already, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen noted experts in the field who have said that should a proposal to make this technical adjustment to how we calculate cost-of-living increases -- across the board in government programs, not just with social insurance programs -- be made with -- paired with a proposal to protect vulnerable groups of citizens, that that would be a positive thing.\xc2\xa0 And that is, in fact, what the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget will do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll see specific details of how that would be done, tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about your reaction, if the administration has any, to comments over the weekend from both Xi Jinping and the Chinese Foreign Minister about North Korea, and if in any way, shape, or form, Jay, they reflect conversations which I gather have been rather consistent and persistent between this administration and Chinese officials.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We welcome the comments by the new Chinese President and by the Chinese leadership that reflect, I think, China\xe2\x80\x99s concern about North Korean actions and rhetoric.\xc2\xa0 We have absolutely been consulting with the Chinese about the need to use their influence on the North Koreans to help bring about a reduction in this behavior and rhetoric from the North Koreans.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also been in discussions with Moscow about this, with the Russian leadership about this.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very open about the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re having these conversations and our call on the Chinese to use their unique influence with North Korea on this matter.\xc2\xa0 It is in the interest of regional stability, in the interest of every nation in the region as well as the world that the situation there stabilize and that North Korea begin to take seriously its international obligations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that, Jay?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your take on this warning, if you will, to countries to evacuate their embassies?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we have seen a series of statements from the North Korean regime that are bellicose in nature and designed to ratchet up tension in the region.\xc2\xa0 This is in keeping with a pattern of behavior that is familiar to those who have worked on the North Korean issue over the past many years.\xc2\xa0 Veterans from the George W. Bush administration and the Clinton administration can certainly fill you in on the history of this kind of behavior that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing from the North Koreans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat we have said is that it is unhelpful, it is concerning, it is provocative.\xc2\xa0 We are taking necessary, prudent measures to ensure that we are -- as we are -- able to defend the homeland our allies.\xc2\xa0 We are working with our allies in Seoul and Tokyo on this matter and consulting with the Chinese and Russians to urge them to use their influence to prevail upon the North Koreans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your understanding of the purpose of these threats?\xc2\xa0 Do you see them as intended to convince America\xe2\x80\x99s allies that it should dial -- that this country should dial back the pressure?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t venture into analyzing the motivations of the North Koreans.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you then, if any of our allies have said, hey, tone it down a little bit?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from our international partners and our allies in the region a great consistency in our approach to this both in the actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken and in our response to it from this podium and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 We are concerned about it, but we also have made clear that this is not an unusual patter of behavior when it comes to the North Koreans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on gun violence, some fairly mainstream conservative groups are now supporting the idea of filibustering even expanded background checks.\xc2\xa0 Does that concern you?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It would be appalling if common-sense legislation supported by 90 percent of the American people, by something like 80 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of gun owners were to be filibustered.\xc2\xa0 Have the courage of your convictions and allow a vote, and vote no.\xc2\xa0 If you want to vote no, vote no.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHow you can tell the families of Newtown victims, some of whom are here today trying to urge members of the Senate to pass -- or at least vote on these common-sense measures -- that the memory of their children doesn\'t deserve at least that -- I can\'t even imagine that conversation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe fully expect and hope that individual senators will be see the rightness in allowing votes on these measures, even if they believe that they need to vote no for whatever reason.\xc2\xa0 The victims of Newtown and of Aurora, of Oak Creek and Tucson, of Virginia Tech and the countless other victims of other shootings deserve that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKristen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, politically, has it become a case of where the President is trying to just get a vote?\xc2\xa0 There has been so much focus on vote -- this up-or-down vote on this legislation.\xc2\xa0 Is that now the focus of just getting a vote?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The focus is on turning these common-sense proposals into common-sense laws.\xc2\xa0 The first hurdle is to ensure that they get voted on.\xc2\xa0 All of these legislative initiatives have, based on the data, majority support in the country.\xc2\xa0 Some of them, like universal background checks, have overwhelming support.\xc2\xa0 As the President said last night, how many issues do you know where the breakdown is 90-10?\xc2\xa0 Ninety percent on one side and 10 percent on the other.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be shocking -- how would you explain to your constituents and for those in leadership, to the entire country, why you voted -- why you took action to block a vote, a simple majority vote on a piece of legislation that more than 90 percent of the American people support; that Democrats, Republicans and independents support; that Americans from all over the country -- both in cities and in rural areas -- support; that gun owners support in substantial majority?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a task I can\'t even imagine trying to accomplish.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I hope, the President hopes, as you heard last night, that that\'s not the path that they will take.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens.\xc2\xa0 The President strongly supports every element of this legislation.\xc2\xa0 He believes that, as the majority of the American people do, that they\'re all common-sense measures, that they all protect Second Amendment rights, and that they will as a package reduce the scourge of gun violence in America.\xc2\xa0 But we have to get to a vote.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Politically, it seems like the assault weapons ban, limiting high-capacity magazines, though, doesn\'t have a whole lot of political viability.\xc2\xa0 So is the focus -- has it changed to just getting a vote on those?\xc2\xa0 Or is he going to direct his focus on getting a vote on expanding background checks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are focused, as you heard the President last night, on every element of this.\xc2\xa0 Every element of this package enjoys majority support.\xc2\xa0 So, generally speaking, something is politically viable if a majority supports it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe you have majority support in the Senate?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 But we won\xe2\x80\x99t find out if we don\'t get a vote.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the first hurdle here is to make it clear to members of the Senate that it is their obligation, if they -- well, whether or not they stood up at the State of the Union and applauded when the President said that Gabby Giffords and the victims of Newtown and the victims of Tucson and Oak Creek and Virginia Tech deserved a vote -- it is their obligation, because they were sent here to vote, to fulfill their responsibility and to show the courage of their convictions, and to explain why they\'re voting no if they\'re voting no, as the President said.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then we\xe2\x80\x99ll see where the votes -- how the votes come out.\xc2\xa0 But we can\'t test the principle about whether or not there\xe2\x80\x99s majority support if some senators decide to prevent a vote.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, on North Korea, the commander of the U.S. Pacific Command said that North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s pursuit of nuclear weapons and missile program represents a \xe2\x80\x9cclear and direct threat to the United States and its allies in the region.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the President share that assessment?\xc2\xa0 And doesn\'t that suggest that there is concern that these latest provocations are more than just bluster?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our North Korean policy is based upon the premise, with our allies and partners internationally, on the proposition that North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s development of nuclear weapons is a threat, is a problem.\xc2\xa0 North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s violation of its international obligations when it comes to developing missile capacity is a threat.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we work so closely with our partners to isolate and pressure North Korea and to bring about a change in behavior.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no inconsistency with that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I have said that the latest developments in North Korea are a matter of concern and that is why we have taken the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken.\xc2\xa0 But it is important also to remember the history here and the patterns that we have seen in behavior and rhetoric from the North Koreans.\xc2\xa0 So both are true.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But some veterans have said that the patterns are different, that this leader is younger and more unpredictable, and that there has been a consistency to these provocations that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been seen in the past.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think much of what you have seen thus far from the North Koreans has occurred in the past, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s testing missiles or weapons, or shutting down or threatening to shut down Kaesong, the joint facility.\xc2\xa0 These are actions that have been taken in the past.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, there\xe2\x80\x99s a new leader, but the regime is very much what it was.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tScott, and then Jackie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow -- could you speak a little bit about the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s appearance in Chicago on the gun issue?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall her getting this directly involved on a political issue of the day.\xc2\xa0 And just some of the White House thinking behind putting her out front right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I urge you to listen to what the First Lady has to say and assess it once you have.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady obviously is a native of Chicago, born and raised in Chicago, and as has been discussed, there was a very high-profile shooting in Chicago -- Hadiya Pendleton.\xc2\xa0 And Hadiya\xe2\x80\x99s parents were in attendance at the State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is something that the First Lady has spoken to -- has spoken about and will likely speak about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the legislative effort, the working with Congress, the political effort, if you will, is being undertaken and led by the President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How unusual is this?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in Washington a long time.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall, other than perhaps Secretary Clinton in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s administration, getting directly involved in a major issue like this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think before you -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to wait and listen to what the First Lady will say.\xc2\xa0 And then, also understand that, as I just said, the negotiations with Congress, the legislative effort that\xe2\x80\x99s underway, the attempt to convince senators directly that they should not filibuster these bills is being led by and undertaken by the President and his team.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJackie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have a question on guns and also on budget.\xc2\xa0 On the guns subject, could you address the critics who, especially yesterday, were saying that the President is exploiting the Newtown tragedy and that were questioning how he came to -- tell us a little about how the family members came to be on Air Force One and brought back to town with him?\xc2\xa0 And a little of what transpired between him and them on the plane for the roughly hour that they were in the air.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the families that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about are here in Washington expressing their views about the need to pass common-sense legislation to reduce gun violence, and I think nobody can speak better for them than they can for themselves.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen we looked at having an event in Connecticut -- Connecticut being a state that recently passed bipartisan legislation to reduce gun violence at the state level -- it was always our intention to meet with Newtown families.\xc2\xa0 The President has met with them in the past.\xc2\xa0 And some of those families were scheduled to come to Washington for this effort that they\xe2\x80\x99re undertaking today, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where the -- when that confluence of our intention to travel and their intention to visit Washington came about, that we offered to give them a ride on Air Force One.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it the President\xe2\x80\x99s idea?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure whose idea it was.\xc2\xa0 The President was very supportive of it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the subject of the budget, will the President be meeting either today or in the near future with some of these representatives of liberal, left groups, who are especially concerned about Social Security?\xc2\xa0 Or how exactly are you handling the protest from the base?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we meet with allies all the time, both in Congress and representatives of outside groups, and that will continue.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a meeting with the President to announce or preview, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a dialogue that of course continues regularly.\xc2\xa0 And we are discussing with Democrats on Capitol Hill what\xe2\x80\x99s in the budget; why it is shaped in the fashion that it is; why it represents the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority, which is economic growth and job creation; and why it embodies the simple fact that you can grow the economy, create jobs, invest in and protect the middle class, protect our seniors, and still reduce the deficit responsibly.\xc2\xa0 It is not one or the other, an either/or proposition.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf you take a balanced approach to deficit reduction, you can do all the things we have to do to invest in our economy.\xc2\xa0 You do not need to do what the House Republican budget does, which is just institute deep, deep cuts in investments that will help our economy grow in the future, and building our roads and bridges and airports and schools; investing in innovation and job training and other aspects of our economy that help the American people take the jobs that will be available in this 21st century economy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tInstead, they cut these programs dramatically.\xc2\xa0 They block grant Medicaid, leaving families who have kids with disabilities in the lurch.\xc2\xa0 They voucherize Medicare and shift costs.\xc2\xa0 And the President is interested in reducing the cost of health care, because the cost of health care drives our long-term deficit and debt challenges.\xc2\xa0 That is one of the aspects of the Affordable Care Act that is often underreported, that it addresses the costs and lowers the costs long term of health care.\xc2\xa0 And the President is interested in that and has taken action on that, and will continue to take action on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe is not interested in the proposition that we should just dump costs onto our seniors who can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it, which is what the House Republican budget does.\xc2\xa0 And this is the irony of this thing -- it\xe2\x80\x99s almost like an alternate universe that House Republicans are living in, as if we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had this debate; as if the American people hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made clear their views on budget proposals like the one the House passed; as if the American people hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made clear their absolute preference for balance in our deficit reduction, and their absolute focus, primarily, on jobs and the economy -- not on doing great harm to our social welfare programs that protect seniors, and giving huge tax cuts to the most fortunate in America.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe had this debate.\xc2\xa0 It would be a little more interesting, I guess, if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t a case of d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu.\xc2\xa0 Because we already know what\xe2\x80\x99s in that proposition.\xc2\xa0 We know how the American people feel about it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know that he\xe2\x80\x99s including the CPI/cost-of-living formula in his budget, not because he favors it but as a sort of overture toward compromise with Republicans.\xc2\xa0 But now that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing so, can you say why he also didn\xe2\x80\x99t include, say, an increase in -- raising the taxable wage base for Social Security, which is, polls show, a really popular idea that would raise revenues for Social Security as well as reduce benefits --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are other things besides so-called chained CPI that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, that were in the Boehner offer, first of all.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, there are a host of proposals that are out that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support that unnecessarily burden seniors.\xc2\xa0 On others, he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously open to discussion.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s made that clear.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s open to negotiation with Republicans about proposals that deal with cost but do not shift costs and burdens to seniors who can\'t afford it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOverall, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that this is a holistic document.\xc2\xa0 This is a budget that demonstrates that if we do all of this together, we can -- if we do all of it together, for those watching on TV, there was a little sideshow, but -- (laughter) -- that if we move forward; if we move all of it together; if we make the necessary investments; if we make sure that the middle class is growing and that there are ladders of opportunity for those who aspire to the middle class; if we reform our tax code in a way that asks the well-off and well-connected to give up special provisions in the tax code that benefit them disproportionately, then we can also make sensible reforms in our entitlements and, taken as a package, reduce our deficit enough so that we exceed the $4-trillion mark over 10 years that economists say will put our debt situation on a stable path, and that is key to longer-term economic growth, which is the objective.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEconomic growth and job creation is the objective.\xc2\xa0 Everything else is a means to achieving that objective.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAlexis, then Cheryl, and then April.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a question on guns and then a quick question on the budget.\xc2\xa0 On guns, you\xe2\x80\x99ve used the term \xe2\x80\x9cblock\xe2\x80\x9d to describe what Senate opponents of the gun legislation are trying to do.\xc2\xa0 But I just want to clarify, are you saying that if 15 senators begin a filibuster, there is not enough support or any technique to break the filibuster and then proceed to move to votes on something that 90 percent, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, Americans are supportive of, that the families are here to lobby for?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying that if they begin a filibuster, it will be blocked?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that senators who decide that it is appropriate to use the filibuster or other procedural methods to prevent a simple vote on these measures are doing a disservice to 90 percent of the American people who support -- in the case of background checks, universal background checks.\xc2\xa0 They are doing a disserve to the memory of the victims of gun violence across the country who deserve at least a vote on these common-sense measures that do not infringe upon our Second Amendment rights.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President said last night if you support the Second Amendment rights of the American people, as he does, you can also support common-sense measures that do not infringe upon those Second Amendment rights but simply make the job of law enforcement easier, and that close gaping loopholes in our background check system that allow for those who should not by law obtain weapons from obtaining them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying -- there is no other way to get a vote once they begin to filibuster?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that this issue has and continues to be challenging enough that if senators don\'t have the guts to go on the record to vote how they feel on this issue -- background checks or the other issues -- that would be a shame.\xc2\xa0 And that would be a disservice to their constituents and to the 90 percent of the American people who want this passed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick question, to follow up on Major\xe2\x80\x99s question about sequestration:\xc2\xa0 I may be confused about this, but sequestration, the $86 billion, is in this fiscal year.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget is talking about the next fiscal year, which begins in October.\xc2\xa0 So when you talk about replacing the sequester, can you just clarify for me, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about two separate fiscal years.\xc2\xa0 The sequester has gone into effect --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The sequester -- the $1.2 trillion of the sequester is over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 This budget would replace the $1.2 trillion of the overall sequester over --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we sustain the impact of the sequester for this fiscal year, but the President is talking about in the next fiscal year we would hook that money back in?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent question.\xc2\xa0 I believe if the President submitted the budget Wednesday and the Congress were to pass it right away, we\xe2\x80\x99d probably deal with the sequester right away.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting technical question about the imposition of the sequester for this fiscal year when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a budget for the next.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur interest, obviously, is and has been consistently in eliminating the sequester today as well as for the next 10 years.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 perhaps without negotiating something that would be retroactively --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a technical question that I think is smart, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get the answer for.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Cheryl, April, then you.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, short-term memory.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, just real quick about Keystone.\xc2\xa0 A Canadian official, Alison Redford, is in Washington this week to lobby on Keystone.\xc2\xa0 Is she meeting with anyone here at the White House?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I think the State Department is probably the fruitful place to have discussions about the process that the State Department is running on that decision.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two questions on the budget.\xc2\xa0 One, you talk a lot about middle-income Americans.\xc2\xa0 What about low-income Americans when it comes to this budget?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re already seeing cuts to programs, furloughs, and things of that nature.\xc2\xa0 What happens with low-income America with this budget?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There will be investments in our budget that demonstrate the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to expanding the middle class by providing what he calls ladders of opportunity to those who are not in the middle class but aspire to be there.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I will ask you to look at the details tomorrow.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, I mean, this has been a theme that\xe2\x80\x99s been consistent throughout this President\xe2\x80\x99s time in office, which is the necessity of investing in our people, investing in our economy so that it grows and creates jobs, and that the benefits of growth are not enjoyed by only the wealthiest, but that our middle class expands and those who aspire to it, who are struggling, can enter the middle class and go beyond that.\xc2\xa0 So that will be an element of our budget.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI mean, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a great question because it goes to the point, which is the President\xe2\x80\x99s priority is -- the North Star is how do we help the middle class, how do we expand the middle class.\xc2\xa0 We have to do that through necessary investments.\xc2\xa0 We have to do that through economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose, he sees, of budgeting; and that, as part of that process, for the strongest economy possible, we can reduce our deficit -- as we have already -- in a way that does not prevent further economic growth or restrict it and that allows for greater job creation.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe can meet that $4-trillion target over 10 years without doing harm to our economy or our middle-class families or our seniors.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole enchilada as far as the President is concerned.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of his budget.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, in this White House, is there a fear that since the GOP is for less government, less spending, that sequestration has fallen into their lap is what they really want?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting theory.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a variety of ways to answer that.\xc2\xa0 I have said in the past that it is ironic, of course, that those who decried the sequester last year have embraced it as a political or tea party victory.\xc2\xa0 But it is also true that the sequester itself does not achieve any of the stated goals of conservatives who want to see long-term reductions in entitlement spending, who don\xe2\x80\x99t generally support across-the-board, damaging cuts to our defense spending.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn the broader proposition, like the idea of shrinking the government, it is interesting to note that -- I was just looking at a table that compared this -- that in the recoveries from the most two recent recessions -- the Great Recession that was in full bloom when this President took office and then the milder recession in 2001, when President Bush was in office -- a huge portion of the job creation in what was otherwise an anemic recovery under President Bush was in government jobs.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, under this President, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had 6.5 million private sector jobs created during the recovery, but we have lost substantial state and local government jobs.\xc2\xa0 That was of course not the case under President Bush, nor was it the case under President Reagan or President Clinton, for that matter.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this has been a unique recovery that has been made more difficult in the jobs area by the layoffs of teachers and police officers as well as other state and local government workers, a problem that the President has attempted to address in the past through the American Jobs Act and through his budget proposals, but Republicans have rejected -- ironically, because of course they celebrated it back when it happened in the past.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go back to the original question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a fear around this White House that you gave -- that this administration, the sequestration gave the Republicans exactly what they wanted?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, if the Republicans are saying that exactly what they wanted is the severe, across-the-board reductions in our defense spending, the throwing-off of people on Head Start and the indiscriminate cuts that have resulted in furloughs and layoffs in other parts of the government, I think it would be interesting to hear them say so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I did promise you a question.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, real quick on the furloughs.\xc2\xa0 About 70,000 employees, or at least 70,000 federal employees got letters last month indicating they were -- their agencies intended to furlough them.\xc2\xa0 The letter started this 30-day clock.\xc2\xa0 Have any actually been furloughed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about administration-wide?\xc2\xa0 I would have to direct you to the agencies.\xc2\xa0 You may be able to contact the OMB and they can help direct you to the agencies.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an agency by agency -- because they each have their own budgets and they have to both make the notices; the notices go out and then the action is taken.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Thatcher?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s going to represent the U.S. at the funeral?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no updates on that at this time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama, has he been critical of her stand on\xc2\xa0 unions?\xc2\xa0 She was pretty tough of on the unions.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear that, Connie?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama, has he been critical -- had he been critical of her stand on the unions?\xc2\xa0 She was very tough on the unions in the U.K.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a different country and a different leader and a different time.\xc2\xa0 I have noted with some irony the fact that -- well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t even go there.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The President put out a statement about mourning the loss of a great British leader who was much admired by many Americans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:44 P.M.
