EST<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you all for being here, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Today, as you probably noticed when you closely watched the President\'s remarks earlier, is all about the initiatives he\'s put forward to help responsible homeowners.\xc2\xa0 I have with me here today the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Shaun Donovan, who is spearheading these initiatives for the President and can describe them to you in detail and take your questions about them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that, I turn it over to the Secretary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'ll just be brief here and leave plenty of time for your questions about the specifics.\xc2\xa0 There were a number of pieces to what the President talked about today, but most importantly, he talked about middle-class families who have been playing by the rules, doing everything right, paying their mortgages on time, and have not been able to benefit from record-low interest rates.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Through strong administrative action, as part of our We Can\'t Wait efforts across the administration, last fall we took very important steps to open up refinancing for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac borrowers who are underwater.\xc2\xa0 But today we still have too many families who may live next door to a family that, just like them, is paying their bills on time with their mortgage, and only because they have a Fannie Mae or a Freddie Mac or an FHA mortgage, they\'ve been able to lower their bills by an average of $3,000, and as a result help not only themselves, their neighborhood, but also the economy more broadly.\xc2\xa0 And yet we have other families who are in exactly the same position, been responsible, and yet because they don\'t have a Fannie Mae or a Freddie Mac or an FHA mortgage, have been unable to benefit from the lowest interest rates in half a century.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the President said in his State of the Union, we need to get back to American values that are about everybody being responsible, playing by the same set of rules, and everybody having a fair shake if they\'re doing the right thing and being responsible.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what fundamentally this announcement was about today -- was making sure that those families, any family that\'s doing the right thing, can benefit from the record-low interest rates that we have today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second main point that he made was about needing strong, clear rules of the road for how our mortgage system is going to operate going forward.\xc2\xa0 And so he announced a Homeowner Bill of Rights that will make sure that when a family is making the single-most important economic decision of their lives, purchasing a home, that they will get fair, simple, transparent treatment.\xc2\xa0 No hidden fees; clear explanation on a single, short form of what they are signing up for, without conflicts of interest.\xc2\xa0 And not only when they buy their home but as they pay their mortgage over time, as a mortgage is what we call serviced by an institution after they bought that home, that they can expect to be treated fairly and transparently as well. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No more lost paperwork while they are trying to get help.\xc2\xa0 No more getting a foreclosure notice while they\xe2\x80\x99re negotiating with their servicer because they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost their job or had a medical emergency, and a very clear right of appeal where they may be going through a foreclosure if they\xe2\x80\x99ve been treated wrongly or wrongly foreclosed on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those are the simple, straightforward principles that were in that Homeowner Bill of Rights, and that was the other major piece of what the President talked about this morning.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also mentioned that there are other pieces, but I will leave those to any questions or comments you may have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s take questions for Shaun. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Julie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything in the plan that the President outlined today that actually requires the banks that hold these loans to go along with this?\xc2\xa0 Or is the administration just hoping that by sort of creating these more favorable conditions that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be compelled to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, in the end -- and this was very important -- what the President wants to do is give families the choice, to put the power in their hands to make a decision.\xc2\xa0 A family that\xe2\x80\x99s holding a loan that isn\xe2\x80\x99t a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loan or an FHA loan has the choice to pre-pay that loan.\xc2\xa0 They could pay off that loan.\xc2\xa0 But they can\xe2\x80\x99t refinance today.\xc2\xa0 So the bank will have nothing -- will have no ability to say no to homeowners.\xc2\xa0 If we get this bill passed, if we get this program established, families would have the power in their own hands to get a new loan and therefore pay off their existing loan, and servicers could not say no to that.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no way that they could stop that family from being able to refinance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would apply to all banks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 What is holding back those families from refinancing is they don\xe2\x80\x99t have an option to refinance their loan today because they are underwater.\xc2\xa0 And by giving them that option, by giving them that path, it would allow them to do that.\xc2\xa0 And banks could not stop that, because loans are prepayable.\xc2\xa0 Every family has the ability, if they can pay off a loan, to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the FHA, which is already facing record losses.\xc2\xa0 Running this program, would it require some movement of government resources to sort of bolster the FHA to make that possible?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Let me take that question on two levels. First of all, there is broad recognition, economists on all sides of the political spectrum have recognized that a broad-scale refinancing effort is one of the most important things that we can do not only for families and for the housing market but also for the economy more broadly -- that for the average family, $3,000 more a year in their pocket every year they pay their mortgage is like a significant tax cut and would boost consumer spending. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It also has the effect of making it easier, obviously, for families to pay their mortgages and therefore reduces defaults, reduces foreclosures and helps to lift house prices as a result.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so there\xe2\x80\x99s broad recognition that this would be good for the housing market and good for the economy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And by the way, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and FHA, because of the scale of their portfolios that we already hold, improvements in the housing market would be dramatically good for the taxpayer as well, because it improves the value of all the investments that we already have.\xc2\xa0 So on a broad basis, the primary reason we\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed this is because this is smart economic and housing policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically, though, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, the President just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s right that a family that is doing the right thing arbitrarily -- because they happen to have a mortgage that isn\xe2\x80\x99t a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or an FHA mortgage -- doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the ability to benefit.\xc2\xa0 And so what we have designed here is a smart, cost-effective plan to be able to give those families access.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I want to give you three specific ways that we would ensure that this would not harm the FHA or taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 First of all, this is only available to homeowners that are current on their mortgages.\xc2\xa0 So these are families -- just think about it, the crisis that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through, these are families that are underwater, and yet through all of that have done the right thing and paid their bills.\xc2\xa0 So first of all, these are safe homeowners.\xc2\xa0 Second, you reduce their payments by up to $3,000 a year.\xc2\xa0 They become even safer homeowners.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, we\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed a source to fully pay for any potential defaults that we believe would come.\xc2\xa0 We believe the total net cost is about $5 to $10 billion in total, which would be offset by the bank fee that the President has proposed.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, we believe, as he said this morning, those who are responsible for this crisis should also be responsible for making sure that the damage is repaired.\xc2\xa0 And the very institutions that made many of these mortgages that caused much of the damage that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to repair ought to participate in helping to solve it, and we think the bank fee is a good source to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then third, and finally, we\xe2\x80\x99ve designed this in a way to make sure that FHA would be protected by proposing a completely separate insurance fund, separate from all of the other loans that FHA has made.\xc2\xa0 It would be a standalone, firewalled off from the reserves for the other portion of FHA, and designed in a way that the very riskiest mortgages, the most deeply underwater, those with the riskiest borrowers would not be able to come into the program without actions by the institutions that currently hold them to make them safer loans.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So all of those give me confidence that not only we would protect the FHA, but, frankly, this would be good for taxpayers broadly because it would help to improve the value of current investments of FHA and the GSEs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it two years ago that the administration first proposed a bank fee?\xc2\xa0 Am I right about that? January 2010?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s correct. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the same type of bank fee that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 As you will see in the budget, it continues to be a proposal that the President believes is the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 I think, broadly speaking, we believe this is the right housing policy.\xc2\xa0 If Congress believes that there are other ways that we should look at paying for this, I think we would be open to discussions -- as the President has done in other situations, we are open to having a discussion with Congress about the best way to make sure the cost of this is covered. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we will ensure, though -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s the principle of the bank fee -- is that there should be a contribution from those who have contributed to this crisis to make sure that the cost of this is fully covered.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wonder if you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it through a Democratic House and Senate why you think now it would be more -- it would have a better chance of making it through Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m the housing secretary; I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave the politics and the discussions about what\xe2\x80\x99s possible in Congress on that to others.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Norah.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not let the housing market run its course and hit bottom, as some have suggested?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, put yourself in the shoes of a family that the President described this morning.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve done everything right, you\xe2\x80\x99ve paid your mortgage -- whether you\xe2\x80\x99re in Florida or Nevada, California, or right there in Falls Church, Virginia.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve done everything right, and because of the irresponsibility of others -- financial institutions, investors, others -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the value of your major financial asset drop by 25 percent, to take Falls Church -- by two-thirds or 75 percent, to take Las Vegas.\xc2\xa0 And you know that if somebody else loses their home next door to you, as soon as that foreclosure sign goes up, your own home loses $5,000 to $10,000 in value. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so what we\'ve seen is, particularly in the hardest-hit communities, a spiral of declining prices because of the number of properties that are coming onto the market.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s no question, if you look at the fundamental economics in the housing market, by all standard measures, we\'ve reached a level of prices that is supported by the fundamental economics.\xc2\xa0 And so the great risk here for families, for neighborhoods, is that we let that spiral continue and continue to harm families and neighborhoods in a dramatic way.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second thing I would say is we should not sit on our hands when we know we can help those families to be able to refinance, to do better and to help the economy, and we have evidence that things that we have done have actually made a difference.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things I would point to in the President\'s proposal today, we have efforts that we call neighborhood stabilization and others that we announced today that try to take this shadow inventory, the number of homes that are sitting vacant in neighborhoods that have been hard hit that are dragging down everybody\'s property values -- we want to make sure that there are options for those homes to be renovated and to be returned to use, oftentimes as rental housing.\xc2\xa0 Because in many of these markets, it\'s a smarter thing for the market and for the neighborhood to convert those to rental housing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when we step back and look creatively at what we could do, what we realized is that between just FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we control close to half of all the bank-owned properties in the country, and that we could be more creative working with local communities, working with for-profit companies, working with local officials, to try to make sure that those homes aren\xe2\x80\x99t contributing to the problem, aren\xe2\x80\x99t sitting on the market vacant, but could be converted to rental, could be renovated, could put construction workers back to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All of those things are steps that have been effective already.\xc2\xa0 On average, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve made those investments, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen 75 percent of those neighborhoods, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the vacancy rates decline.\xc2\xa0 And two-thirds of those neighborhoods we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the house prices rise relative to surrounding communities.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we have tools that we know work, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to sit on our hands watching middle-class homeowners who\xe2\x80\x99ve done the right thing and played by the rules get hurt by a strategy that says simply we\xe2\x80\x99re going to stand by and watch them suffer.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you may be asked -- you may have to sit on your hands because Congress has said that this plan is dead on arrival.\xc2\xa0 You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a bank levy passed, as Jake pointed out, two years ago when Democrats controlled the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t this proposal today, in an election year, not look like just an effort, a politically motivated effort to reach out to homeowners in key battleground states that just also happen to have big mortgage foreclosure issues, like Nevada, Arizona, Florida, et cetera?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave the election-year politics to others.\xc2\xa0 Let me talk about the facts here and the economics and the housing issues --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about the politics, then what\xe2\x80\x99s to say that any of this is actually going to help anybody when Congress is not going to approve it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the question I was going to try to answer.\xc2\xa0 When the President, last fall, said that there were steps that we needed to take to help Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac borrowers refinance, there was bipartisan support in Congress to do that.\xc2\xa0 Senators Boxer and Isaacson introduced a bill, and I think you will see broad support across the political spectrum to do this.\xc2\xa0 And just look at the community of economists and other housing analysts, from Mark Zandi and Martin Feldstein on the right to a whole range of economists that are more on the left -- this is one of the things that folks believe is the most important step that we can take. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, we\xe2\x80\x99re not just depending on Congress.\xc2\xa0 Most of the steps that the President discussed today, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the steps with properties -- the REO properties that I talked about in the shadow inventory -- those are steps that we can take on our own.\xc2\xa0 The steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken to help Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac borrowers refinance, steps that we will take as part of this to help FHA borrowers refinance, the Homeowner Bill of Rights -- and I could go on -- all of these are steps that we can take and we are taking, because we can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for Congress on these.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, sorry, last one.\xc2\xa0 And then the President held up a sheet of paper today and said, this is what a form should look like.\xc2\xa0 When is that going to happen when someone gets a mortgage, they can just fill out one sheet of paper?\xc2\xa0 Or is that an empty promise?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, now that the CFPB has a director and has taken on its full powers, it is moving forward quickly to issue those forms.\xc2\xa0 And let me be clear about this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- can get a mortgage with one sheet of paper?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Miraculous, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xc2\xa0 Look, I have -- one of the things I recognize -- and this is an important thing about the CFPB that I think has been missed in all the discussion -- before the CFPB, there were eight different federal agencies, including HUD, that had authority over the home-buying process and the mortgage process.\xc2\xa0 By consolidating those -- and specifically both HUD and the Fed had control over those forms that you sign, and there were conflicting rules that we had, and that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the things that led to these forms being far more complicated than they should be. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The CFPB is simplifying and making more understandable this process, partly by consolidating the authority of conflicting agencies into a single entity.\xc2\xa0 And I think this is one of those things that is good for homeowners, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also good for lenders.\xc2\xa0 And it is one of those things that brings together a broad spectrum on the right and the left for things that we can do to simplify and improve the mortgage process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, to follow up on Norah\xe2\x80\x99s point, in October, the We Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wait stuff -- how many homeowners have you helped, then, with Fannie and Freddie mortgages since October when the President said he was going to move?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 So, in total, since -- and the program is called HARP -- since it was first introduced in 2009, it\xe2\x80\x99s helped close to a million homeowners refinance.\xc2\xa0 The changes that the President called for and that were then implemented later in -- or there were specific details released later in the fall, those changes began to go into effect just in December.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The ones from October of 2011?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right, the ones -- so to be clear, he gave his jobs speech and called on his administration to work with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to make changes.\xc2\xa0 We worked on those through the fall and they were implemented, started in December.\xc2\xa0 And so already there are tens of thousands of homeowners that have closed on those loans.\xc2\xa0 But again, they\xe2\x80\x99ve only been in place for a few weeks at this point where folks can actually get those loans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, when the President announced that first plan in February of 2009, three years ago this month, he promised I think it was up to 9 million people to stave off foreclosure.\xc2\xa0 You just said he\'s helped up to 1 million people.\xc2\xa0 So why should the American people have confidence that this is now the fourth or fifth plan you\'ve had, this one is actually going to work?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 So to be clear, the HARP portion of it, the hope was that it would help 4 million to 5 million homeowners.\xc2\xa0 That was one portion of it.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said this morning, while we\'ve made significant steps, we\'ve made real progress.\xc2\xa0 Just to take one example, nearly 5 million families have had their mortgages modified since the President took office.\xc2\xa0 Foreclosures are down by almost 50 percent, the number of people entering foreclosure down by almost 50 percent. So we\'ve made progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as the President also said this morning, we\'re not satisfied.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been disappointed that we\'ve haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to reach more people.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, specifically on this refinancing program, what we found after we rolled it out is that there were many barriers out in the market to more people being able to participate.\xc2\xa0 We fixed the problems on their first liens, but many of them had second loans, and frankly, lenders were unwilling to let those families refinance because of the second lien.\xc2\xa0 So we went out and negotiated with those lenders and we got their approval to automatically resubordinate those loans.\xc2\xa0 That was an important step.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mortgage insurers that were standing in the way of those families being able to -- so there\'s a whole series of barriers out in the market.\xc2\xa0 And I would just say, frankly, one of the problems we had is our mortgage system got so complex, there were so many different players, that that very complexity that led to the crash also made it harder to fix.\xc2\xa0 We went out and negotiated with all those, we made steps, and they\'ve all agreed to make changes to allow more families to refinance. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what that means is that there are now about 11 million additional families just with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgages who will have the opportunity, if they choose to, to refinance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick -- you were saying at the top that basically to make the President\'s plan work you\'re going to tell financial institutions that they can\'t say no to refinancing.\xc2\xa0 How do you actually -- how does the federal government tell private institutions, you can\'t say no?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 You misunderstood. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Single-family loans in this country are prepayable, so any homeowner already has the right, even if they\'re -- if you owe $300,000 on your house and it\'s a $250,000 house and you have $300,000, you can go and pay off your mortgage today -- right?\xc2\xa0 The issue is they can\'t get a new $300,000 loan. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what this plan would do, the way it breaks through this barrier for these families is to allow them to refinance that loan, to get a new loan that allows them to pay off their existing loan.\xc2\xa0 There\'s nothing the existing lender can do today -- we\'re not changing this at all -- the existing lender today can\'t stand in the way of a family paying off their existing loan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying if they have $300,000 laying around to pay it off -- or how do they do that?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 They\'re going to go get a new loan, and that new loan for --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the lender is okay with that, is just going to say, this is the rate you\'re at right now, it\'s fine if you just want to change it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 What they would do is they would refinance into a new FHA loan and that would allow them to pay off their old loan.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what this plan would do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some analysts in the housing industry have expressed concern that the announcement that the Justice Department is going to set up a residential mortgage-backed securities working group -- seems like a task force -- could actually wind up making banks more skittish.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would say -- and I would draw an analogy to the work that we\'ve been doing in the servicing arena -- the sort of status quo, if you will, is that we have federal enforcement agencies including HUD, state attorneys general, local agencies, private investors all pursuing in disparate, disconnected ways their enforcement actions against the institutions.\xc2\xa0 And just like on servicing, where the potential outcome is that we could have ended up with 50 different sets of rules in different states around the foreclosure process, these enforcement actions dragging on for a decade or more, what we\'re trying to do with this task force is to bring together the various pieces that are key to the securitization problems and to coordinate and improve information-sharing across those so that we could get to coordinated solutions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So while I believe it will help us reach more significant justice for homeowners and for communities that were harmed, I also think it would have the potential, as the President said in the State of the Union, to turn the page on this era of recklessness faster because of this coordinated action. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s exactly what I think we have been working to achieve in the servicing settlement that we\'ve been discussing.\xc2\xa0 And in that sense, it will bring certainty and clarity -- to lift the cloud of uncertainty from the market that is holding back lending today -- will help to contribute to lifting that cloud as well by this coordination.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that would be the impact on the market, but in terms of the impact on the banks and how they\'re approaching loans, is there any concern that it might have a negative impact or a negative effect?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, clearly, there needs to be accountability for mistakes that were made.\xc2\xa0 Where mistakes were made there will be penalties, there will be restitution that needs to be paid to homeowners that were harmed.\xc2\xa0 There is no question about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But again, on the other side, having a disparate set of actions that are pursued independently, just as they were by the state attorneys general on foreclosure in a disconnected way, leaves a cloud of uncertainty on these institutions.\xc2\xa0 And we need more clarity.\xc2\xa0 We need the clear, simple rules of the road to help us here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, this is part of what the Homeowner Bill of Rights that the President announced today is really aimed at.\xc2\xa0 No more race to the bottom.\xc2\xa0 No more institutions falling through the cracks because there are multiple different regulators that have different rules.\xc2\xa0 A single, clear set of rules about how mortgages are serviced, who\'s responsible. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And frankly, that will not only be good for homeowners and the housing market more broadly, it will also be good for investors because they will now have clarity where they own a mortgage who\'s in charge on making decisions when a homeowner gets in trouble, what can they expect.\xc2\xa0 Those clear rules of the road are good for homeowners and communities, but they\'re also good for investors and markets and institutions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Margaret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\'s a provision in this package that is asking banks to write down 140 percent of LTV loans.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain how that would work and why banks would agree to that when they haven\'t been ready to jump on principal write-downs to date?\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the robo-signing agreement, can you tell us what day it will be finalized and whether California will participate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to comment on the specifics that you asked about on the servicing settlement.\xc2\xa0 All I would say is that we are making good progress there.\xc2\xa0 I think you know that documents have been shared with the attorneys general.\xc2\xa0 They are making decisions as we speak.\xc2\xa0 A number of them have already announced support for it and it will be finalized, I would expect, in the coming days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To go to your other question, I mentioned earlier that we want to make sure that we\'re instituting protections so that the very riskiest loans, institutions need to take responsibility for those and to bear some of the cost of those. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In situations where you have a deeply underwater loan, where the house may be worth only half of what the mortgage is, there\'s increasing evidence that it makes good economic sense for those loans to be written down because it lowers the likelihood of default substantially.\xc2\xa0 And so in that case, we would work with Congress to set limits like the 140 percent limitation that we\'ve specified that would ensure that we\'re not taking -- that we are minimizing risk to FHA when we take those loans when they would be refinanced.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congress would need to agree to regulate that, essentially. You can\'t do it administratively and you don\'t think it will work voluntarily -- it would take an act of Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, Congress could give us -- could pass legislation that would give us the ability to set that limit, obviously.\xc2\xa0 But that is one of the ways that we are looking to make sure that we are protecting the FHA fund in terms of the design of the program.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The only other thing I would just say is that there are other options for principal reduction as part of this effort that are very important.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that the record-low interest rates that we have today -- one of the sort of powers that that creates is the ability for a homeowner to choose either -- when they refinance -- to take their savings in lower payments, but also to take their savings and plow it back into paying off their mortgage more quickly.\xc2\xa0 And almost any homeowner that\'s below that 140 percent loan-to-value level, if they choose to take their savings and put it into reducing their principal by shortening the length of their loan, almost every one of them, with today\'s low interest rates, can get back above water, can rebuild their equity in five years.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that we would want to encourage with this plan. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what we would do -- what we\'re proposing is that the closing costs for those refinancings would be eliminated where a homeowner chooses to plow their savings back into reducing equity [sic].\xc2\xa0 And we think that that could be an important part, using the power of the low interest rates today, to help families get back above water more quickly, because, as I said, there is mounting evidence that that principal reduction is an important element of helping there be fewer foreclosures and to help the housing market recover.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand your answer to Norah\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Can the CFPB create a one-page mortgage on their own in the next few months, or did you say what the timetable would be for that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask Richard Cordray exactly what the timeline is.\xc2\xa0 I know -- and our teams have been coordinating -- I know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already begun work on it.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President showed a sample form today in his speech, so they\xe2\x80\x99re well along in working on this.\xc2\xa0 Elizabeth Warren began work on this even before she left the agency.\xc2\xa0 So it is well on its way.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an exact date for you on when it will be completed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 Taking sort of a step back, obviously there have been several ideas put forward to try to deal with this problem over the last three years.\xc2\xa0 And there have been a couple, even, both in this administration and the last administration, that tried to use FHA to refinance people.\xc2\xa0 And none of them have really worked that well.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering what is sort of fundamentally different about this program, even if you could get it through Congress, that would suggest this would work when every other effort has had just sort of minimal success?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Well -- and I talked earlier about the fact that while many of these efforts have not reached as many people as we had originally hoped, if you go to talk to any of those more than a million families who\xe2\x80\x99ve had their FHA mortgages modified, for example, through lost mitigation efforts and have been able to stay in their homes, the remaining number of the almost 5 million families that have had them modified through other efforts, if you talk to the 60 percent of African American or Latino homeowners who were able to buy a home last year because of an FHA mortgage, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that without FHA, without the programs that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had and the impact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had, this housing crisis would have been much, much worse.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We did -- we were successful in pulling this housing market back from the precipice, from 30 straight months of house price declines to house prices actually rising in the first year that the President was in office.\xc2\xa0 So we have made a real impact, and FHA has been an important part of that and has reached millions of homeowners. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that while not all of those efforts have been successful or reached the families we had hoped, there has been a real impact, and you could go talk to those families about that impact.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically on this effort, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is that refinancing is something that middle-class homeowners who\xe2\x80\x99ve been paying their bills, have been doing the right thing, fundamentally believe is a choice they want to make -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the million homeowners in HARP that have already participated, or the hundreds of thousands of FHA homeowners who have already refinanced their mortgages through our streamlined refinancing program that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even talked about today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we believe there is great demand -- and frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fundamental fairness issue for families that have played by the rules, done the right thing, paid their bills, to be able to refinance.\xc2\xa0 And that incentive, being able to save $3,000 a year, on average, is something that we believe families will choose.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was great demand for the other programs, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not disputing that the people who did benefit from them were in fact greatly benefited.\xc2\xa0 But as you\xe2\x80\x99ve said, as the President has said, they did not have the kind of impact that was anticipated. So what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand is should we basically expect similar results this time and it will be maybe modest, but the people it helps, it will be very, very helpful, or do you think it will be bigger?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 The barriers that we have run into have been resistance from banks, market barriers.\xc2\xa0 I talked about a number of them before -- on second liens, on private mortgage insurance.\xc2\xa0 Those are the types of barriers that have stopped programs from reaching as many homeowners as they could have reached before.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, families will choose and it is up to families to say they want to refinance.\xc2\xa0 But they can be confident that today, because of the work that this administration has done, working with and pushing the private sector, second liens will be automatically resubordinated.\xc2\xa0 Private mortgage insurance -- there has been an agreement to transfer that mortgage insurance. That was a major barrier before.\xc2\xa0 Another barrier was the fees and costs of refinancing, getting an appraisal, for example.\xc2\xa0 The vast majority of these now could use an automated system for appraisal, which eliminates the cost of a full appraisal. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so, many, many of the barriers that have stood in the way before have been knocked down through the hard work of my staff and many others across the administration to remove those barriers that were there before.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- with this proposal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 For this and for the changes that we announced without Congress acting to the HARP program that will allow more Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac borrowers to refinance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do a couple more and then --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris Arnold, National Public Radio.\xc2\xa0 To pick that up, I think you had said 11 million homeowners are now potentially eligible for HARP 2, I guess.\xc2\xa0 When HARP 2 was announced, FHFA was sort of adamant about saying this is only going to reach a million more borrowers.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying enough of those roadblocks have now been removed without legislation that your estimate is it could be 11 million?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 No, to be clear, what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about is two different things.\xc2\xa0 How many homeowners are underwater and because of their interest rates could potentially benefit -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of pool of eligible borrowers, versus how many will actually choose to refinance.\xc2\xa0 Those are two very different things.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, who can actually make it through the system to refinance --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 That ultimately choose and get it\xc2\xa0 refinanced?\xc2\xa0 So the changes that have already been announced to HARP that have been done through administrative actions as part of our We Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wait efforts would reach -- would make eligible a significant portion of those 11 million.\xc2\xa0 But there remain additional barriers.\xc2\xa0 And to be clear, those 11 million are Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac borrowers that are underwater and could benefit from a refinancing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are some additional barriers, particularly for those homeowners that are above water, for example.\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t get some of the same changes that were done for underwater borrowers. We believe that we ought to clear away those remaining barriers to allow that full group of the 11 million at least to be eligible.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one step. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But then there are about 3.5 million borrowers who don\xe2\x80\x99t have a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or FHA mortgage who, because simply, as I said before, they happen not to have a loan that\xe2\x80\x99s insured or guaranteed by one of those entities they have no ability to refinance today.\xc2\xa0 And those 3.5 million would be the additional ones that, creating a new pathway, the proposal the President made today would open up as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have an updated estimate of -- if we were saying a million through HARP 2 several months ago, currently, with the changes that have been made, is there an estimate for how many people might be reached now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 This is -- one of the things that was very important to the President in this is the American people, they value choice, they want to be able to choose to refinance their mortgage; they\xe2\x80\x99re stopped from doing that today.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make an individual personal decision. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether they even hear about this program and call their lender, we can\xe2\x80\x99t control completely those choices.\xc2\xa0 And so what I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into is speculation about exactly how many of those homeowners are going to choose to refinance, for whatever their personal reasons may be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said earlier, which is here\xe2\x80\x99s the eligible universe that we think ought to have the opportunity -- the President believes ought to have the opportunity.\xc2\xa0 Because they\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing by the rules, they ought to have the chance to choose that option, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t have that today.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the legislation would open up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking about the eligible homeowners, the ones who have made their notes, who have tried to keep up with their payments, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the big part of the problem the ones who can\xe2\x80\x99t do that?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the big drag on the market, the people who maybe can\xe2\x80\x99t keep up with their payments because they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost a job, can\xe2\x80\x99t refinance because they can\xe2\x80\x99t make their payments?\xc2\xa0 Is there any program beyond what you\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed already to help those folks?\xc2\xa0 And isn\xe2\x80\x99t that part of the big drag on the market here?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that there are significant challenges for folks that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to keep up with their mortgage payments.\xc2\xa0 And increasingly, as this crisis has progressed, the cause has been less they got a terrible loan product to begin with and more and more the unemployment or underemployment.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so what I would say about that is two things.\xc2\xa0 One of the best housing policies is our jobs policy.\xc2\xa0 The more that we can get the American Jobs Act passed, get the payroll tax extended, all of the steps that the President has been calling for on the jobs front, that will help the housing market.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second of all, as I said earlier, we have been able to help close to 5 million families get their mortgages modified.\xc2\xa0 The number of people falling into foreclosure is down by almost 50 percent today from where it was when the President came into office -- so we are making progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is more that we can do.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things that is part of this effort that the President talked about today is another We Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wait action.\xc2\xa0 Last summer we came out, in FHA and through the HAMP program, and extended the forbearance that we provide.\xc2\xa0 Basically, if you\'ve got a homeowner who\xe2\x80\x99s lost their job, is looking for a job, obviously paying their mortgage is going to be tough for that stretch while they\xe2\x80\x99re temporarily unemployed.\xc2\xa0 And so we changed our policies to say we would provide, instead of three or four months of sort of bridge time where we would not require payments, that we were extending that up to 12 months. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In fact, today, almost half of unemployment spells are more than six months.\xc2\xa0 And so it\xe2\x80\x99s a different kind of unemployment we have today.\xc2\xa0 We had to -- we wanted to adjust our policies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is that we took those executive actions and the rest of the market has followed.\xc2\xa0 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac recently announced that they were extending their own forbearance policies to 12 months.\xc2\xa0 And today, as part of this announcement, Wells Fargo and Bank of America have agreed to extend their forbearance policies to 12 months as well.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an important additional step.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, on Friday, we announced that we were making changes to our modification program to HAMP that would allow more borrowers with secondary debt or credit card or medical bills to participate, and some other changes that would expand the eligibility for that program as well. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we do have efforts -- but I would just come back and -- your question implied that somehow this refinancing issue isn\xe2\x80\x99t a central issue to the problem.\xc2\xa0 And if you talk to, as I said, economists across the political spectrum, they believe -- and we believe, the President believes -- that broader-scale refinancing is one of the most important steps we can help for these families, to put $3,000 more a year on average into their pockets, but also to help the economy more broadly, because consumer spending is obviously a critical piece of what is going to help accelerate our recovery.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so we believe that the announcement today on refinancing is also a critical piece of the puzzle, and in fact is one of the most important things that we can do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you all very much.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Shaun.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take any questions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought you were going to take questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you guys can email me.\xc2\xa0 Real quick, because you have a lot to write about and report on now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you -- there are reports out about some renovations having to do with the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 And can you explain what is true, what is not true?\xc2\xa0 Is the Oval Office going to have to be vacated for some time?\xc2\xa0 Does the President, whoever he may be, have to be relocated to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I have a very broad portfolio, but renovations to the campus here are not part of it.\xc2\xa0 So we refer those questions to the GSA, which handles the renovations and all the work that\xe2\x80\x99s done on the property here.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific for you.\xc2\xa0 I would just refer you to the GSA.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney said today that his campaign is not focused on the very poor because they already have an ample safety net.\xc2\xa0 I guess two things.\xc2\xa0 One, does the President think that the very poor already have an ample safety net?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any response more broadly to Romney\xe2\x80\x99s comment?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response specifically to any comment like that by a candidate.\xc2\xa0 The President, for himself, believes that the recession, the great recession, the worst recession since the Great Depression, did harm to Americans of all kinds, and middle-class Americans, lower-income and poor Americans were hit hard by the recession.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s been focused very aggressively on doing everything he can to grow the economy and create jobs for everyone. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more on the Republican primary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Buffett Rule was introduced in the Senate, and I wanted to ask or get you to clarify, does the President believe that the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpay one\xe2\x80\x99s fair share of taxes\xe2\x80\x9d is 30 percent of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He said that in the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 If you were a -- if you make more than a million dollars --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you earned a million dollars or more.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As a principle that he would apply to individual tax reform, he believes that the overall principle, as articulated by Warren Buffett, that millionaires, billionaires should not pay a lower effective tax rate than middle-class Americans -- in the case of Mr. Buffett, than his secretary -- and that level, the President believes, as does Mr. Buffett, should be 30 percent.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if the Buffett Rule were enacted -- does that mean the President would no longer seek to eliminate the so-called Bush tax cuts for the wealthy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re obviously very related because they have to do with federal income tax.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s approach towards overall individual tax reform would be guided in part by the principle established in the Buffett Rule. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He has made clear, for many years now, that he favors extending permanently the middle-class tax cuts while letting expire the upper-income Bush tax cuts -- which, I want to make this point, costs -- adds $800 billion over 10 years to our deficit, just the higher-income tax cuts.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what an overall tax reform package would look like and what the overall rates would be would be worked out, but those principles would guide it.\xc2\xa0 And certainly in the President\xe2\x80\x99s position, it remains, absent any action on individual tax reform, that the higher-end -- upper-income Bush tax cuts should expire.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it mean that if a wealthy income earner were paying in excess of 30 percent of Adjusted Gross Income that they are paying more than their fair share?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a floor, not a ceiling.\xc2\xa0 If that wealthy earner owes more, then obviously the wealthy earner, like everyone, should pay his or her taxes.\xc2\xa0 The 30 percent is a floor.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Egyptian delegation is in Washington.\xc2\xa0 Among the folks they\xe2\x80\x99re meeting with are some of the national security advisors to the administration. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think this is a -- not "the" Egyptian delegation, but an Egyptian delegation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so what I want to know is, does the President or the Vice President intend to speak directly with any of them?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us any update on whether anything concretely, whether the ball has been moved on the sort of diplomatic standoff and where are those discussions about the NGOs?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are no plans to have the President or the Vice President meet with this particular delegation.\xc2\xa0 The President, as I think we read out, spoke with General Tantawi not that long ago.\xc2\xa0 And we are very actively engaged diplomatically with the SCAF, Supreme Council of the Armed Forces of Egypt, on the issue of the American citizens who have been told they can\xe2\x80\x99t leave Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work on that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t any update for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Bipartisan Policy Center, collection of Democrats and Republicans -- Chuck Robb and others -- there was a report which talks about the need to, in its view, bolster Gulf allies and undertake Gulf covert activities regarding Iran.\xc2\xa0 But specifically, it suggests that there be what it calls an increase in rhetoric.\xc2\xa0 It says, \xe2\x80\x9cThrough a negotiated settlement, Iran should abandon its nuclear program through negotiations or have its program destroyed militarily by the U.S. or Israel" --\xc2\xa0 basically suggesting that the "options off the table" statement is not credible.\xc2\xa0 Do we think that that is a credible --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it suggests that at all.\xc2\xa0 I think our President\xe2\x80\x99s policy is very clear.\xc2\xa0 We are working -- because of the approach he\xe2\x80\x99s taken we have brought together the most comprehensive international consensus that has ever existed with regards to opposing Iran\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to live up to its obligations. It has resulted in the most stringent sanctions regime ever that has had direct and measurable effects on the Iranian economy, and has clearly had an impact on the Iranian regime.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President makes clear that he is determined, and it is this administration\xe2\x80\x99s policy that we are determined to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 He has made clear, and others in the administration including myself have made clear, that we do not exclude any option in ensuring the fulfillment of that policy position. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President strongly believes, as do many of our international partners and allies, that the course we are on is the right course.\xc2\xa0 It is having significant event, but it should be clear that we do not rule out any options.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Let me go all the way in the back.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on the -- about the Situation Room meeting on Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the readouts for seven months now.\xc2\xa0 Have that meeting stopped, or you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do apologize, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked into that.\xc2\xa0 There are regular discussions obviously about the implementation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Afghanistan policy.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe for the last several months there has been a President-run AfPak strategy meeting or AfPak implementation meeting, but I will check on that for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is a report in circulation which says that Pakistan supports the Taliban to come back in power.\xc2\xa0 What do you have to say about it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I apologize, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite hear.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is a report in circulation about -- a NATO and ISAF report which says that Pakistan continues to support Taliban to come back in power.\xc2\xa0 A BBC report --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have any comment on that. Obviously we -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the report, frankly.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy is very clear.\xc2\xa0 It is driven by the goal to disrupt, dismantle, and ultimately defeat al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 It also has its objective to stabilize Afghanistan, to give the Afghan government the breathing room necessary to build up its armed forces, to allow it to gradually take over security lead. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are in the process of that transition as we draw down U.S. forces that were sent in the surge.\xc2\xa0 That process will result, as articulated by NATO and Lisbon, in the full transfer to Afghan lead by the end of 2014.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you all very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 2:17 P.M.
