Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p class="p2">12:48 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a pleasure to see you all.\xc2\xa0 I was reminded on my way out here that today is the 40th anniversary of Hank Aaron breaking Babe Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s all-time homerun record.\xc2\xa0 And we offer him congratulations on that anniversary.\xc2\xa0 It was a remarkable achievement by a great baseball player and a great man.</p>\n<p class="p2">Before I take your questions I also wanted to note that some of you have seen that the President will travel on April 22 to Oso, Washington, to view the devastation from the recent mudslide and to meet with families affected by this disaster, as well as first responders and recovery workers.\xc2\xa0 Further details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Washington will be available in the coming days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who lost a loved one and those whose friends and family remain missing as a result of this devastating incident.\xc2\xa0 The administration remains focused on supporting state and local efforts and first responders.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President, earlier this month, declared a major disaster in the State of Washington and ordered federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts.\xc2\xa0 This assistance is in addition to the support provided under the Presidential Emergency Declaration granted on March 24, 2014.</p>\n<p class="p3">Julie Pace.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 How are you?</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m good.\xc2\xa0 How are you?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m great.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to ask about the equal pay event today and the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.\xc2\xa0 You and other officials have been saying that this renewed focus on equal pay does not have to do with politics, but I\'m wondering how that assertion squares with the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks today, which were sharply partisan in which he tried to draw a lot of contrast with Republicans.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because Republicans are blocking passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act.\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 If they wanted to take politics out of it, they should do what the President asked them to do today, which is pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\xc2\xa0 Instead, they are, for reasons that I\'ve yet to quite understand but appreciate, decided to engage in a debate about whether or not this is the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Well, we absolutely welcome that debate, as progressives have for years, which is when there is something that a President or a Congress can do to ensure that there\xe2\x80\x99s greater equality in our country for women, we ought to do it.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that, upon any close scrutiny, is clear we ought to do.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President took action, using the authorities that he has, to sign an executive order -- or two executive orders today to empower women who work for federal contractors.\xc2\xa0 But Congress can provide the same kind of protections for all women workers out in the country by passing this important legislation.</p>\n<p class="p3">So if they\xe2\x80\x99re complaining about it being politics now, then they ought to just pass it, because it\'s the right thing to do.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\'m wondering, do you see this as a policy issue that you support but one that is also advantageous politically?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that paycheck fairness is the right thing to do for our economy because when women succeed in our economy America succeeds.\xc2\xa0 That\'s how the President views it.\xc2\xa0 It\'s why he signed in his first few days as President the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which addresses some of the issues related to paycheck fairness.\xc2\xa0 But more needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President took the action he took today and why he called on Congress to pass additional legislation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Again, this President, and the Democratic Party more broadly, have been pushing these kinds of issues for a long time. The reason why the President signed the Lilly Ledbetter Act and that was the first bill he signed as President was because it had been blocked previously be Republicans and it took a Democratic President to sign it.\xc2\xa0 The only way to prove that there\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan support for women on these issues is to demonstrate it with votes in Congress.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on another topic, the President is going to Fort Hood tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 He has attended a memorial service there previously.\xc2\xa0 These memorial services have almost become -- I don\'t want to say routine, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve become sort of part of the job for him.\xc2\xa0 I wonder how he views tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s memorial service in sort of the spectrum of memorial services he\xe2\x80\x99s had to attend for gun violence victims.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Julie, I would say that it is true that the President has attended ceremonies and services of this nature in the past far too often, but they never become routine.\xc2\xa0 The pain of the family members who lost loved ones is not routine; it\'s unique in each case, in each instance.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President is as heartbroken by this event as he has been on each occasion that something like this has happened in the country and where he has traveled to participate in ceremonies or services that commemorate those lost and celebrate their lives.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we expect any particular focus on any policy element of gun violence in his remarks tomorrow?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s views on the need to take common-sense steps that address the challenge and problem of gun violence in America are clear and he has continued to act on his views through executive action.\xc2\xa0 He has made clear his extreme disappointment in Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to follow the lead of the American people and overwhelming majorities of Americans in every state in the country by expanding background checks.\xc2\xa0 The memorial ceremony that he\xe2\x80\x99ll attend I think will focus on, and the President will focus on, the families of those who were lost and those who were lost themselves.</p>\n<p class="p3">Jeff.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, outside economists say that the data that the President is citing, the 77 cents phrase, is wrong.\xc2\xa0 Regardless of the merits of this push, do you have better data?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely not the case.\xc2\xa0 There are some economists who have different views on what it means.\xc2\xa0 But to say economists -- I mean, from Reuters I would expect something a little more precise.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whoa --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just not true.\xc2\xa0 The facts are that women make 77 cents for every dollar that men make.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of reasons for that --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are those the facts, though?\xc2\xa0 Seriously, are those the facts?\xc2\xa0 Because that\'s been disputed --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s based on Census data.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- over the last couple days as this story has gotten a lot of play.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s based on Census data.\xc2\xa0 Now, there has been an important discussion in the last several days and even prior to that about what those data represent and how much of that is due to a lack of transparency in the pay that women receive versus men; the lack of -- the kinds of things that ensure that women who do the same work get the same pay that men get; and also things that have to do with the fact that women tend to fill lower-wage jobs, which is why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important to raise the minimum wage.</p>\n<p class="p2">Again, if Republicans feel like this is a political or partisan issue, they ought to demonstrate that they want to help women at the lower end of the income ladder here by raising the minimum wage -- because I think 60 percent of minimum wage workers are women in this country.</p>\n<p class="p2">But certainly there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of discussion about what that figure represents, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt on the basic fact that women earn 77 cents for every dollar that men earn.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is doubt.\xc2\xa0 Maybe not all economists -- I should have said \xe2\x80\x9cmany\xe2\x80\x9d -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that there are others who would say --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jeff, it\xe2\x80\x99s based on Census data.\xc2\xa0 I understand that there is discussion about what it means.\xc2\xa0 But, look, I just want to thank everybody for allowing us to have a sustained debate about this issue because I think every day that we talk about it and every day that the American people see that this President and his allies in Congress are fighting for women is a good day because it brings us closer to the day when we can actually get things done in Congress that will help women.</p>\n<p class="p2">Look at what the President signed today.\xc2\xa0 Look at what is contained within the Paycheck Fairness Act.\xc2\xa0 These are not objectionable provisions.\xc2\xa0 These are things that just allow for the kind of transparency that means that women will know whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re getting fairly paid for the work that they do, and that they have the kind of protections that they need to ensure that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you would oppose that.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask about another issue.\xc2\xa0 Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s state security service has said that protestors in Luhansk have seized the state building, wired it with explosives, and are holding 60 hostages.\xc2\xa0 The protestors are denying this.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. have any confirmation on that?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports.\xc2\xa0 We do not have independent confirmation.\xc2\xa0 We would certainly, as we have made clear, oppose any violence, any taking of hostages, any placement of explosives in a building, as has been reported.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t have independent confirmation.\xc2\xa0 We have serious concerns about developments in parts of Ukraine, and I think you heard Secretary Kerry discuss this in open testimony on Capitol Hill earlier today.</p>\n<p class="p2">So as to this specific report, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have independent confirmation, but we are certainly concerned about a pattern here that is very worrying when it comes to efforts to cause unrest and to destabilize Ukraine and destabilize the Ukrainian government.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will this be the primary issue discussed by the President and Secretary Kerry in their meeting today?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President and Secretary Kerry have a standing meeting weekly if they\xe2\x80\x99re both in town, and they discuss the whole panoply of issues that fall into the Secretary of State\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio, so that would include this issue; it would include the Middle East peace process; it would include all the other issues that are front and center currently on the\xc2\xa0 -- within foreign affairs.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jim.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, your own Labor Department has that gender pay equity metric at 81 cents.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I want to thank you, Jim, again, for bringing this up and giving me the opportunity --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I sent you the link.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And the point is?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That Reuters didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it wrong.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was for you, Jeff.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">The numbers are a little bit all over the place, are they not?\xc2\xa0 That number, 77 cents --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do you doubt -- I mean, we can have this --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt that there\xe2\x80\x99s gender pay inequity.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Does anyone here doubt that -- okay.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s gender pay inequity.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clear, as Lilly Ledbetter can attest, that it is essential for women to be able to know what they\xe2\x80\x99re being paid compared to women who -- I mean, to men who do the same work.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that there needs to be protections for women so that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t retaliated against when they seek to discuss what they\xe2\x80\x99re paid or find out what their coworkers are paid.\xc2\xa0 And the efforts underway here, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the executive orders and the provisions the President signed today, or the call on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, are very common-sense ways to address the need for these protections for women and the transparency that allows for those protections to take effect.</p>\n<p class="p2">So again, the data that -- the 77 cents figure, which is a widely used figure, is based on Census data, as I understand it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- if there\xe2\x80\x99s ways to slice this data that alters it by a few cents here or there -- there\xe2\x80\x99s any dispute over the fact that that gap continues to exist.\xc2\xa0 There is an important discussion about what contributes to that gap, but I think that it is fair to say that women in most workplaces would recognize that the gap is a problem and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that needs to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 And first and foremost, what needs to be addressed is the need for equal pay for equal work.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But should the President sign an executive order establishing gender pay equity here at the White House?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you raised --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged yourself that --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you raised this again and I was looking forward to the question, because what we have here is a circumstance because of the transparency that exists at the White House, where everyone in America can find out what everyone here earns, everyone in America knows that everybody is paid equally for the same job.\xc2\xa0 So that we have two senior advisors to the President -- one is a male, one is a female -- they\xe2\x80\x99re paid the same. We have two deputy chiefs of staff -- one is a male, one is a female -- they\xe2\x80\x99re paid the same.\xc2\xa0 Our National Security Advisor, our Counterterrorism Advisor, our White House Counsel, our Director of Communications -- they\xe2\x80\x99re all paid at the same level as their male counterparts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And that is a good thing.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s how it ought to be and what the Paycheck Fairness Act would do and what the executive orders the President signed today would do, is ensure that there is more transparency so that women who don\xe2\x80\x99t work here but work in places where there isn\xe2\x80\x99t that kind of transparency cannot be retaliated against when they discuss their salaries and try to find out what their male counterparts are making, and that they can enjoy the protections necessary to assure that they can pursue equal pay for equal work.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And getting back to Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s accusation that Russia is making mischief and perhaps even setting a pretext for further intervention in eastern Ukraine -- does that suggest that perhaps Moscow has not taken seriously or is not taking very seriously this threat of additional sanctions?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about what Russia has done in Crimea.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very concerned about the presence of substantial troop numbers on the Ukrainian border.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about efforts underway in Ukraine to destabilize the situation there in eastern Ukraine, destabilize the government. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I think there\xe2\x80\x99s ample evidence that some of the unrest there has been promoted by people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t local, people who are paid.\xc2\xa0 And that suggests an effort underway to destabilize Ukraine, and causes us great concern, which is why Secretary Kerry spoke about this as he did before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, why I discussed this yesterday, and why we are monitoring the situation there very closely, and why we are making clear to Russia that there will be additional costs incurred by Russia should Russia engage in further provocations and transgressions.</p>\n<p class="p3">Major.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, would you just acknowledge that this debate is a bit more nuanced?\xc2\xa0 I mean, as the briefing showed yesterday, you can pay everyone in a workplace the same for equal work and still have a median wage gap because of various choices, education, jobs held.\xc2\xa0 And the Labor Department data says when you factor those things in, you get a wage gap that\xe2\x80\x99s not $1 to 77 cents, but the difference can be as little as 5 or 6 cents.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you often ask us -- the Affordable Care Act or other things -- to look at the broader list of statistical nuances around a public policy issue.\xc2\xa0 Would you at least acknowledge that that is part of the --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And, again, I am absolutely encouraging a broader discussion here about these issues and hope that we can talk about this --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that 77 cents is not, though we have\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 discrimination --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I hope we have this discussion every day until Congress passes the Paycheck Fairness Act.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you acknowledge that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, acknowledge --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That the 77 cents to a dollar is not absolute proof of 23-cents-per-dollar discrimination.\xc2\xa0 There can be other economic factors.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I acknowledged that in my first answer, which is that there are a variety of factors that play into the gap. That the gap exists I think is indisputable, and that there is workplace discrimination I think is indisputable, especially for women who have experienced it.\xc2\xa0 And that there are things that we can do administratively and legislatively to address that problem is also indisputable, as the legislative language in the Paycheck Fairness Act demonstrates, as the Lilly Ledbetter Act demonstrates, which again Republicans blocked and Republicans are blocking this bill now.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there is a long sort of track record here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not talking about Republicans --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So when Republicans get up -- when Republicans get up and they --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about Republicans.\xc2\xa0 This is Labor Department data --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve cited the arguments that you\xe2\x80\x99re making and they cite -- they want to talk about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in different work places, as opposed to what they can do to help improve the situation.\xc2\xa0 What they\xe2\x80\x99re not acknowledging is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem that they have the power to address, but they refuse to address it.\xc2\xa0 And they refuse to address it through raising the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 And they refuse to address it by putting in place protections for women when it comes to paycheck fairness.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a problem and it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame.\xc2\xa0 And I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity here for Republicans to get right on this, and we certainly hope they do.\xc2\xa0 We certainly hope they take away this debate from us by doing the right thing.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Ukraine, is the message to the Ukrainian transitional government, in the face of provocation, you are essentially on your own?\xc2\xa0 That if there is a security situation from provocateurs or paid agents, that you have to deal with it yourself?\xc2\xa0 And is there a concern in this building that there is some level -- as you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked before about the restraint the transitional Ukrainian government has showed -- at which they can no longer be restrained and have to respond in a way to either protect themselves, protect their territorial sovereignty, or their very own citizens?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I need a more specific question.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, it\xe2\x80\x99s a sovereign government and they enjoy all the rights and responsibilities of sovereignty.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the actions that the United States has taken or that our allies have taken --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, clearly, this administration --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- suggest that Ukraine is on its own, and quite to the contrary.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve acted very quickly with our international partners to support Ukraine and to provide assistance to Ukraine.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is those are long-distance signals.\xc2\xa0 And as the question from Jim suggested, you\xe2\x80\x99re not always sure whether or not Moscow reads those signals the way you want them to be read.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about actual things on the ground where in Ukraine that are not parts of Crimea that are up for grabs essentially, this administration has complimented the transitional government for not sort of taking the bait and responding in an aggressive, military way to things that look provocative.\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern that there could be a point at which that transitional government can no longer take that provocation and acts in a way that it believes legitimately protects its citizens, but could cause a more destabilized military situation that could spin out of control?\xc2\xa0 And what are you trying to counsel them to do?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re getting at.\xc2\xa0 I think that our view has been that the Ukrainian government has performed admirably in the face of a very difficult situation, both economically and in dealing with the provocations and transgressions by the Russian government and others who seek to destabilize Ukraine and to undermine its efforts to focus on and move forward towards May 25th elections.\xc2\xa0 So we continue to make clear our admiration for the manner in which the Ukrainian government has addressed these challenges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, as Secretary Kerry did today, earlier, that we strongly oppose and are concerned by some of the actions we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in eastern Ukraine and, of course, categorically reject and oppose the occupation of Crimea and the attempted annexation of Crimea with utter disregard for international law, treaty obligations and the will of the Ukrainian government, parliament and people.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was read by some in the Middle East today.\xc2\xa0 They concluded that he was blaming -- or placing the larger share of blame on the current impasse in the Middle East peace talks on Israel, not allowing -- not following through on the scheduled Palestinian prisoner release and the new tenders in the settlements.\xc2\xa0 Is that a sense you think is a fair reading of what the Secretary said?\xc2\xa0 And does the President share that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think that we have and Secretary Kerry has made clear that it is incumbent upon both sides to make difficult decisions and difficult choices to move the process forward.\xc2\xa0 And both sides have done things that have made it more difficult to move forward, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made that clear when it comes to actions by the Palestinians with regards to international organizations, as well as the issues you cite with regards to the Israelis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think that our view -- I know that our view has been that both parties need to continue what they had done earlier, which is make some tough decisions and do so in pursuit of negotiations and ultimately a negotiated peace.\xc2\xa0 Right now, at the request of both parties, the United States facilitated a meeting, as I think you know, between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators just last night to continue the intensive effort to resolve their differences.\xc2\xa0 Gaps remain, but both sides say they are committed to narrowing the gaps.</p>\n<p class="p3">There is a window of time for a path back to substantive negotiations.\xc2\xa0 The issue now is whether the parties can demonstrate that they are willing to make the difficult decisions required to move the process forward.\xc2\xa0 The parties both understand what the choices are, and they are not choices or decisions that the United States can make for them; they are choices and decisions that the parties have to make for themselves.\xc2\xa0 So we play a role in facilitating this process, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an important role.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, some of these tough -- all of these tough choices and decisions have to be made by the parties.</p>\n<p class="p3">Yes, in the back.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions, if I may.\xc2\xa0 We know that Rwanda is celebrating the 20th anniversary of -- or, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, commemorating, not celebrating -- the 20th anniversary of the genocide.\xc2\xa0 But in that region, right now, there is a crisis unfolding in South Sudan with 3.7 million people facing -- the U.N. says 3.7 million people are facing starvation, which would be akin to the famine that happened in Ethiopia in the early \xe2\x80\x9880s.\xc2\xa0 And of $1.27 billion requested by the U.N. only $385 million has been received, and the U.N. reports that if $230 million is not received in the next 60 days, this is what might unfold.\xc2\xa0 Has this administration focused any attention on what is going on there, and is there a reason why we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard very much about this?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, actually, I discussed this last week in response to a question, and the answer is, yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on it.\xc2\xa0 The situation in South Sudan is of great concern, and we are working with our partners to address it.\xc2\xa0 I think some of the questions that you ask have to do with the United Nations and not just the United States, but our focus from our representation at the United Nations as well as here at the White House and the State Department is very intense on this challenge.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At what point would the United States enter?\xc2\xa0 For example, with this great attention being given to, say, Ukraine</p>\n<p class="p2">-- and rightly so -- and the goings-on there directly by the United States, for example -- at what point would the United States -- what would be the calculus at which point the United States would decide to move in and take action outside of the U.N.?\xc2\xa0 Because not everything, clearly, happens by the U.N.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the case, but we, as we have with Ukraine and as we do with crises internationally all the time, we work together collectively with our partners to address challenges, and we work unilaterally.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s been the case with Ukraine; it\xe2\x80\x99s been the case with South Sudan, and will continue to be. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But I understand -- part of the point of your question I think is that when the world\xe2\x80\x99s attention is focused on a crisis like Ukraine, there\xe2\x80\x99s almost a limit to the bandwidth and that the media have to focus a spotlight on a challenge like you see there or elsewhere when there are situations in places like Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent on this administration, this Congress and governments around the world to make sure that even as we address some of these crises that are getting the most attention at the moment, that we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to make progress on other challenges.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to South Sudan, we are committed to doing that.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that that challenge is no easier than many of the others we face.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the question of fair pay -- sorry, just one more -- there is clearly a racial component as well, with black men making about 25 percent approximately; Latino men making approximately 66 percent; black women 70 percent and Latino women 60 percent.\xc2\xa0 What is the calculus, political or otherwise, for not having a focus on this inequity in pay?\xc2\xa0 Is there a calculus?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would disagree that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a focus on it.\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons -- and this goes to the example I cited about women, but also goes to employments facts about minority men and women -- is that we need to raise the minimum wage because it will benefit directly those who currently earn the minimum wage, earn below $10.10 an hour, as well as help everyone above that pay level, and help the economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So, again, this is an opportunity for Congress to take direct action that can assist people who are working full-time, taking responsibility for themselves and their families, and yet receiving a wage that places them in poverty, which surely isn\xe2\x80\x99t what anyone\xe2\x80\x99s view of what a minimum wage should do.\xc2\xa0 And what I think you fail to hear Republicans concretely address is whether they support a minimum wage at all, because the logical extension of their arguments against raising it leads you to the conclusion that they don\xe2\x80\x99t support a minimum wage at all, at least some of them don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, they should say so.\xc2\xa0 They would be, I think, aggressively opposed by vast majorities of the American people should they say that.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the question on equal pay, in terms of what the President is presenting with this statistic -- when it came to health care, the President himself cleaned up his words and said, look, I should have been more careful about if you like your doctor or if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\xc2\xa0 On this issue, when you\xe2\x80\x99re acknowledging 77 percent is not exactly the figure, his own Labor Department is saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not it, why does he continue -- including today -- why does he cite that figure when even you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not quite that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said it\xe2\x80\x99s more nuanced than that.\xc2\xa0 You said in your first answer --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said that there are many -- 77 cents is based on Census data.\xc2\xa0 You can argue with the Census if you like.\xc2\xa0 I can give you their number.\xc2\xa0 Two, I did say that there are a lot of factors that go into the gap and I would not contest that.\xc2\xa0 Nobody here has contested that.\xc2\xa0 But surely you\xe2\x80\x99re not contesting -- and I want to commend the men aligning here in the front row and the interest they\xe2\x80\x99re taking in this issue -- but surely you\xe2\x80\x99re not contesting the suggestion that there is pay discrimination in this country, right?\xc2\xa0 And if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- and if there is, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Slate Magazine called it a lie to say 77 percent, though, and they said when you factor in a bunch of other stuff, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably 91 cents compared to a dollar -- which is still not right because it\xe2\x80\x99s not a dollar to dollar.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s make that clear.\xc2\xa0 However, it\xe2\x80\x99s not 77 cents.\xc2\xa0 So why does the President say that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, again, this is Census data.\xc2\xa0 This is built on Census data.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not disputing that others have made different assessments about the factors that go into that gap.\xc2\xa0 The gap is --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even here at the White House -- you cited that again and again, that 88 cents is not really fair because that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you said because there are some who make a little lower and that brings the median down.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No question.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so it\xe2\x80\x99s more nuanced.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And the reason you know what people make here, every dollar for every individual, is because we publish what people make.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congress publishes that, right?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I think you ought to ask Congress what the equities are in offices in Congress.\xc2\xa0 The fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem here that needs to be fixed doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean -- and that the problem exists in a lot of places only reinforces the need to fix it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s excellent that there is so much interest in this subject because certainly millions of Americans across the country are interested in paycheck fairness and they\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Congress take action.\xc2\xa0 And while they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it, they\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Congress raise the minimum wage because that would disproportionately help women workers across the country as well as all workers across the country.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other quick question.\xc2\xa0 Attorney General Holder today testified on a number of subjects on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 And he was asked about General Petraeus and whether there\xe2\x80\x99s still an active criminal investigation as to whether he leaked classified information.\xc2\xa0 Attorney General Holder testified openly under oath that that investigation is still open almost two years after General Petraeus stepped down at the CIA.\xc2\xa0 My question being, one, has the President been briefed on that investigation at all in the last two years?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you have to ask the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t weigh into Justice Department investigations.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken publicly many times about how terrible it is and illegal to leak classified information.\xc2\xa0 So why has this case not been resolved after a couple of years?\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the Justice Department -- wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t this administration want to get to the bottom of it?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Justice Department for questions about a Justice Department investigation.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question about how the data is going to be handled once the Department of Labor gets it from these federal contractors.\xc2\xa0 I looked through the --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sounds like a question you might want to ask the Department of Labor, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll try.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, just bear with me for one moment.\xc2\xa0 If not, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask you about dry-cleaning disparity between men and women, so it\xe2\x80\x99s your choice.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s terrible!\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering when the President will take up that battle.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 How about the disparity that existed until three years ago where insurance companies could charge you twice as much as your twin brother, even if you\xe2\x80\x99re in the same health.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Leaving, aside my fictional twin brother -- on the question of the data, so for example, it\'s going to be collected, it\'s going to be aggregated. It\'s not going to, obviously, identify names.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m curious if whether the government is interested in, for example, disclosing this information so a Latina engineer at Lockheed Martin would know what she\xe2\x80\x99s earning compared to a white male engineer at that same company, rather than, for example, relying on that coworker to share that information voluntarily with her.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the policy of the administration would consider?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that is something you would probably need to address to the Department of Labor, and I can take the question to see if we have any insight.\xc2\xa0 I believe that the EO talks about prohibiting retaliation against those who discuss what they\xe2\x80\x99re paid and what their colleagues are paid, but for more details, we\'ll take the question and I suggest you go to the Department of Labor.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jon.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I just want to clarify, come back to the pay equality issue.\xc2\xa0 So the President cited Census data that women on average make 77 percent of what men make.\xc2\xa0 Why is that an example or evidence of discrimination in the workforce at large, but it\'s not evidence of discrimination with women here at the White House making 88 percent of what men here at the White House make?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jon, what I can --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s the same measure.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the same metric.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a big gap on both sides.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And we are hard at work here at the White House in the most transparent of ways to ensure that women compete for and earn senior positions, that women are recruited for more junior positions so they\xe2\x80\x99re put in the pipeline for senior positions in the future.\xc2\xa0 In fact, virtually every woman who sits in a senior staff office today was promoted internally within the White House or the administration to that position, which demonstrates the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to a diverse workforce here at the White House and in the administration, and demonstrates his commitment to having the very best talent around him advising him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Because it\'s not just a question of fairness; it\'s a question of quality.\xc2\xa0 And there have been great studies in the private sector about having more women in senior levels in Fortune 500 companies improves the performance of those companies and improves the bottom line of those companies.\xc2\xa0 And I know the President feels that the quality of debate and discussion and advice that he gets within this White House and, more broadly, within this administration is improved by the presence of women and, more broadly, of a diverse body of advisors.</p>\n<p class="p2">So there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that everybody needs to do more to get this right.\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons why, one of the factors that goes into the figures that exist here at the White House is an aggressive effort to bring in young, talented women and others to help the workforce here to be diverse and to make sure that there are people in the pipeline that are promoted within this White House and future White Houses and administrations so that that talent base is there in the future.\xc2\xa0 Because it goes to fairness, but it goes to quality.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, I\'m asking about the metric here.\xc2\xa0 You would say there is no pay discrimination here at the White House, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s no pay discrimination here at the White House?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s absolutely the case that there\xe2\x80\x99s equal pay for equal work.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But you\'re using the same metric to argue there\xe2\x80\x99s pay discrimination in the workforce at large.\xc2\xa0 Explain to me why the metric works in the economy at large but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work here at the White House.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the fact that there is indisputable Census data that women earn 77 cents on the dollar that men earn -- a lot of things go into that discrepancy.\xc2\xa0 Discrimination and lack of transparency and the inability of women to find out what they\xe2\x80\x99re paid vis-\xc3\xa0-vis their male coworkers is part of the problem.\xc2\xa0 That is something we in the administration, via the President\xe2\x80\x99s authorities, and Congress, through legislation, can address.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President is saying today.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he took the action he took.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he called on Congress to do what it can do to address those problems.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">I\xe2\x80\x99m not disputing that there are a lot of factors that go into that.\xc2\xa0 But the discrepancy is real.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think that --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of discrimination outside the White House, but the same metric is not evidence of discrimination inside the White House. \xc2\xa0I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same metric.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jon, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not doing very well.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re at 88 percent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, again, if you want to compare metrics we\xe2\x80\x99re doing better than the public at large.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is that the goal, to do a little bit better than the outside?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, the goal is to do absolutely the best that we can do.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re striving to do here, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the legislation the President calls on Congress to pass would ensure that others are doing across the country.\xc2\xa0 And what astounds me about this debate is the suggestion -- and you don\xe2\x80\x99t hear a lot of women making it -- that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t pay discrepancy here, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t pay discrimination.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not making that suggestion.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about a metric you are using for companies outside the White House.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we don\xe2\x80\x99t dispute anything you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, except that we have transparency here.\xc2\xa0 What this law, if passed, would provide would be greater transparency for women.\xc2\xa0 The transparency exists here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 It should exist everywhere.\xc2\xa0 And women should have the protections and tools in order to fight for paycheck fairness and transparency.\xc2\xa0 Republicans object to this strenuously, using the same arguments that conservatives use when they objected to every bit of progress made on civil rights for women and minorities over the past many decades.\xc2\xa0 And they were wrong then and they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">But I want to have this debate.\xc2\xa0 I want you guys to -- let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about this every day until they pass it.\xc2\xa0 Peter.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a quick question on Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 You talked yesterday about evidence or a suggestion that the Russians are basically hiring some of these people that are causing these disruptions in Eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Now the Russian Foreign Ministry is out saying that there are 150 American mercenaries from the company Greystone Limited, formerly part of Blackwater, that are dressed up in Ukrainian special task force uniforms and creating disruptions in Eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Just for the record, what do you make of this?\xc2\xa0 This is from the Russian Foreign Ministry.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, well -- I mean, I would I think point you to what the company itself has said in the past, which is that this is not true.\xc2\xa0 And certainly -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what your question is.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to what the company has said.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this bogus, this allegation?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It seems bogus to us, yes.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The Senate voted yesterday to block the entry of the new Iranian U.N. envoy to the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Will the administration follow up and block his entry?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we share the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s concerns regarding this case and find the potential nomination extremely troubling.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. government has informed the government of Iran that this potential selection is not viable.\xc2\xa0 The legislation passed by the Senate underscores just how troubling this potential nomination would be. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would President Obama sign it?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, this is a potential nomination.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve informed the government of Iran that this potential selection, rather, is not viable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but the bill passed by the Senate yesterday to deny a visa.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a potential selection, as I understand it, that has not been formally made.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve informed the government that that selection is not viable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Connie.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, on the Middle East, you said the window of opportunity is closing.\xc2\xa0 Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it been closing for 66 years?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what\xe2\x80\x99s so special about this period of time?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a longer discussion.\xc2\xa0 But the parties have been engaged in a process to try to move towards a framework for negotiations and a way of resolving some of the most difficult issues that separate the parties.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve put in place a process with some timelines associated with it.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with the parties to facilitate the discussions and negotiations that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been engaged in.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">They met again last night.\xc2\xa0 There was some progress, but there are decisions that need to be made and steps that need to be taken that only can be made and taken by the parties themselves.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, on the Alan Gross situation in Cuba, he now says he is going on a hunger strike.\xc2\xa0 He wants the U.S. to talk directly to the Cubans.\xc2\xa0 After 50 years, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it time to just talk directly to them and not --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Connie, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt in the minds of any senior Cuban government official what our views are, which is that Mr. Gross ought to be released immediately.\xc2\xa0 And that has been made abundantly clear I think to the government of Cuba, and it remains our position to this day.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they want the recognition of direct talks.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think they want the release of Mr. Gross, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we are working very hard to achieve.</p>\n<p class="p2">April.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on another topic.\xc2\xa0 On Thursday, President Obama travels to another part of Texas and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk to me about what the President plans to say, particularly as this is his second term and he\xe2\x80\x99s been more outspoken this term, it seems, when it comes to matters of race?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You want me to preview his remarks?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I do.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t get ahead of the President.\xc2\xa0 I know the President looks forward to this event and will be delivering remarks, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to steal his thunder.\xc2\xa0 The achievements that the Civil Rights Act represent are historic, and the President will gladly participate in an event celebrating that achievement.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President address some of the issues, as you noted, so I think you know where he comes from and what his thinking is.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that will be reflected in the remarks that he gives.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview it.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you say you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to steal the President\xe2\x80\x99s thunder -- should we take that as being something like the President might make news, he will speak more forcefully on issues of race?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave it to the President to --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you because you said that.\xc2\xa0 You said you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to steal his thunder, and thunder makes you think that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to shake something up.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s thunder coming.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Give me something.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President has spoken about civil rights in the past, and done so I think with clarity and passion.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect this to be any different.</p>\n<p class="p2">Olivier.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be dense, but what does \xe2\x80\x9cnot viable\xe2\x80\x9d mean?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not viable?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The potential nomination --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s diplomatic jargon --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yeah, it kind of is, right?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- to mean what you want it to mean.</p>\n<p class="p2">(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s actually a very candid answer, because I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell from that whether you guys would let this person in the country or not.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether you\xe2\x80\x99re --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is an issue in terms of our -- the fact that we host the United Nations and some of the issues around that, and the questions about that process that I would refer to our representation at the U.N.</p>\n<p class="p2">We have made our views as an administration known, as I did just now, about this.\xc2\xa0 And we think that the bill that the Senate passed reinforces the point that we\xe2\x80\x99re making, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve communicated that to the Iranian government.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What point are you making?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not viable.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the House is scheduled to vote on budget alternatives this week -- I think five of them in total.\xc2\xa0 Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, a Republican, is going to bring to the floor the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget.\xc2\xa0 Something similar to this happened in 2012, I think it was, with numbers but no specific policy behind it.\xc2\xa0 It was voted down 0-414.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget.\xc2\xa0 If they follow that path again, that will be welcome to us, because what they\xe2\x80\x99re really trying to do is hide from a debate about the Paul Ryan budget, which is, as the President said, like a very bad rerun, which in budget form ensures, if passed, that millionaires would be an enormous tax break; that middle-class families would get hit hard; that Medicare would be turned into a voucher program, no longer a guarantee; that, in the height of hypocrisy, the savings that the Affordable Care Act achieves would be retained in order to give those tax cuts to millionaires, but the Affordable Care Act would be repealed, meaning that the 7-point -- however many million who have signed up on the marketplace, plus the 3 million kids -- young adults, rather -- who are on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plans, plus the millions who have benefited from expanded Medicaid would be out of luck, but those millionaires would get that substantial tax cut.</p>\n<p class="p3">I think whatever phony votes they might have, the debate is going to be around those priorities.\xc2\xa0 And you know what the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities are, which is to work together to invest in our economy, invest in our people, to expand opportunity, to reward hard work, to do things like raise the minimum wage so that folks at the very bottom who are working full-time and not even making a salary that pulls them out of poverty get a fighting chance -- not to reward people at the very top with a hefty new tax cut.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s good policy.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think most Americans think it\xe2\x80\x99s good policy.\xc2\xa0 But we welcome the debate.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know in the front row we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the 77 cents and 88 cents on the dollar conversation.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you specifically -- I know in the White House if you work the exact same position you get paid the exact same no matter your gender. Some nonpartisan, nonpolitical organizations have done all sorts of studies on this and found, to quote them, \xe2\x80\x9cOnce you compare men and women with the same background doing the same job and working for the same type of employer, they essentially earn the same amount throughout America,\xe2\x80\x9d which is to say that this problem for people doing the same thing for the same amount of time is --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who you\xe2\x80\x99re citing, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s from an organization named PayScale, based in Seattle, Washington.\xc2\xa0 The number I think is separated by like, perhaps 3 to 5 percent, they suggest.\xc2\xa0 So does the White House concede that there have been great gains made; that actually, if people across America are doing the same thing for the same amount of time whether they\xe2\x80\x99re a man or woman, they are making about the same amount of money?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with that study.\xc2\xa0 I think there is certainly ample evidence that, as I think Lilly Ledbetter discovered, that that is not uniformly the case.\xc2\xa0 And it is something that is not the case and is allowed to not be the case in part because of the lack of transparency and the retaliation that some females across the country experience from their employers when they seek to find out what they\xe2\x80\x99re making compared to what their male colleagues are making, or counterparts are making.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we need something like the Paycheck Fairness Act.</p>\n<p class="p3">If, as a broad matter, you\xe2\x80\x99re making the argument that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress in this country on equal rights for women, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s true -- often resisted by the same folks who are resisting this.\xc2\xa0 So we need to make more progress.\xc2\xa0 And passing this bill, taking the action the President took today, signing the Lilly Ledbetter Act, as he did in 2009 -- those are all steps along a road and a path that is unfinished, but that needs to be finished.</p>\n<p class="p3">Jessica.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on Syria.\xc2\xa0 A lot of the time during the hearing with Secretary Kerry today was spent on Syria, and he suggested that we would be sending -- the U.S. would be sending more assistance to the moderate opposition.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, since there\xe2\x80\x99s been some reporting on a debate in the White House between the Pentagon and the State Department, if that assistance is going to include training and arming the moderate opposition.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said and others have said, Secretary Kerry and others have said, the President has asked his team to constantly evaluate the situation in Syria as it evolves and as it changes, and what our options are when it comes to making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re employing the best policies when it comes to providing humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people and assistance to the moderate opposition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">As we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed periodically, that conversation continues and that discussion continues.\xc2\xa0 And we are, and the President is, evaluating different options.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make or even a review of the options that may or may not be on the table to present to you except that the President is always tasking his team to assess what options are available to him.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that there is more support within the administration or a bigger push for military action, or a little bit more traction at that point --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you mean exactly by military action.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has addressed the question of direct military action.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to discuss what options are on the table.</p>\n<p class="p3">Yes, sir.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A question on Canada, but not Keystone this time.\xc2\xa0 Any comments on yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s result of the election in Quebec, where the party in favor of breaking up the country lost the government?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reaction here.\xc2\xa0 The State Department might have it.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much, everybody.</p>\n<p class="p3">END<br/>\n\t1:40 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
