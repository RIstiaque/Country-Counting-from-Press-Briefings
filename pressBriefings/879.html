Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:43 P.M. EDT\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Welcome, everybody, to the White House for your daily briefing.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I think you had advanced warning of, I have with me today the Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he briefed the President today on the drought that is affecting a significant portion of the country.\xc2\xa0 The President asked for this briefing.\xc2\xa0 And I asked that Secretary Vilsack join me here today to give you an update and to take your questions on issues surrounding the drought.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you could, as is past practice, hear Secretary Vilsack\xe2\x80\x99s presentation, then ask questions that you have for him.\xc2\xa0 I will, of course, remain here ready to take your questions on other subjects.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I give you Secretary Vilsack.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tI did have an opportunity to visit with the President.\xc2\xa0 He is very well informed on the circumstances surrounding a very serious drought -- the most serious situation we\xe2\x80\x99ve had probably in 25 years -- across the country.\xc2\xa0 Sixty-one percent of the land mass of the United States is currently being characterized as being impacted by this drought.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd our hearts go out to the producers, the farm families who are struggling through something that they obviously have no control over and trying to deal with a very difficult circumstance.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s no question that this drought is having an impact on our crops:\xc2\xa0 78 percent of the corn crop is now in an area designated as drought impacted; 77 percent of the soybeans that are being grown in this country also impacted.\xc2\xa0 It also obviously involves other commodities as well -- 38 percent of our corn crop as of today is rated poor to very poor; 30 percent of our soybeans poor to very poor.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this obviously will have an impact on the yields.\xc2\xa0 Right now we have indicated yields will be down about 20 bushels to the acre for corn and about 3 bushels to the acre for beans.\xc2\xa0 That may be adjusted upward or downward as weather conditions dictate.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis will result in significant increases in prices.\xc2\xa0 For corn, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a 38 percent increase since June 1st, and the price of a bushel of corn is now at $7.88.\xc2\xa0 A bushel of beans have risen 24 percent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis administration has taken quick action to try to provide help and assistance.\xc2\xa0 At the instructions of the President, the first thing we did was to streamline the disaster declaration system and process, reducing the amount of time it takes to have a county designated.\xc2\xa0 That means that producers in those counties and adjoining counties are able to access low-interest loans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President instructed us to reduce the interest rate on those loans from 3.75 percent to 2.25 percent.\xc2\xa0 He also instructed us to open up new opportunities for haying and grazing -- our livestock producers are in deep trouble because of the drought.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t have anyplace for their cattle.\xc2\xa0 They are looking at very high feed costs.\xc2\xa0 So we are opening up areas under the Conservation Reserve Program for emergency haying and grazing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNormally when that happens, producers have to return a portion of the CRP payment that they receive.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve reduced the portion that they have to return from 25 percent to 10 percent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur tools are somewhat limited and so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to work with Congress to provide opportunities either through the passage of the Food, Farm and Jobs bill or through additional disaster programs, or perhaps additional flexibility in the Commodity Credit Corporation to provide help and assistance to our farmers.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe question that a lot of folks are asking is what will the impact be on food prices.\xc2\xa0 Because livestock producers will begin the process of potentially reducing their herds in light of higher feed costs, we would anticipate in the short term actually food prices for beef, poultry, pork may go down a bit, but over time they will rise.\xc2\xa0 We will probably see those higher prices later this year, first part of next year.\xc2\xa0 Processed foods obviously impacted by crop yields, and we will likely see the increase of that also in 2013.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\'s important to note that farmers only receive 14 cents of every food dollar that goes through the grocery store, so even though prices on commodities increase significantly, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily translate into large increases for food prices.\xc2\xa0 And if, in fact, people are beginning to see food price increases now, it is not in any way, shape, or form, related to the drought.\xc2\xa0 And we should be very careful to keep an eye on that to make sure that people do not take advantage of a very difficult and painful situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is some degree of uncertainty about all of this.\xc2\xa0 Technology has allowed us to have more drought-resistant crops.\xc2\xa0 The spotty nature of drought, the spotty nature of rains can sometimes result in better yields than anticipated.\xc2\xa0 We\'re just going to have to see.\xc2\xa0 As of today, 1,297 counties have been designated as Secretarial Disaster Areas.\xc2\xa0 That\'s approximately a third of the counties in the United States.\xc2\xa0 We\'re adding 39 counties today in eight states -- those states are New Mexico, Tennessee, Utah, Wyoming, Arkansas, Indiana, Georgia, and Mississippi.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have staff that is now traveling to 12 states significantly impacted by the drought in order to get a firsthand look at conditions, and we\'ll do everything we possibly can to help folks.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re obviously going to need some help, working with Congress, to create greater flexibility in programs, to revive the disaster programs that were allowed to expire last year, or to pass a Food, Farm and Jobs bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tJay, with that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Ben.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 To follow up on the point you just made about your tools are limited, is there a specific amount of aid that you\'ll be seeking from Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 It\'s very difficult to pinpoint that with specificity because we don\'t really know what the impact could be.\xc2\xa0 For example, based on our current estimates today, the corn crop would still be the third largest corn crop in the United States history.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is because there were more acres planted at the beginning of the year.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we just have to wait to see what our yields are going to be.\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, though, we can create a structure and system, either through a revival of disaster programs or passage of the Food, Farm and Jobs bill that contains some relief for livestock producers, or some flexibility in CCC, so we\'re prepared to move as soon as we know precisely what the impact is going to be.</p>\n<p>\n\tCrop producers have the ability to utilize crop insurance, and for the most part, crop insurance will provide historically about 72 percent coverage of yields and revenue loss.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s the livestock producers that are in the biggest and most troubled situation because they simply don\'t have any disaster program and there\'s no such thing as a crop insurance program for livestock producers.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have one other question.\xc2\xa0 You gave us some specific numbers about crops and prices, but this drought is obviously happening at a very difficult time for the whole country and the economy.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a macro sense of how this drought could affect the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Well, right now, the rural economy is one of the bright spots in the economy.\xc2\xa0 We\'re seeing record farm exports; we\'re seeing expansion of new markets; we\'re seeing development of a bio-based economy with record amounts of biofuel being produced; and we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing outdoor recreation opportunities take off because of more acres in rural and conservation programs.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s a little difficult to say what the macro impact will be.\xc2\xa0 One out of every 12 jobs in the economy is connected in some way, shape, or form, to what happens on the farm.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re actually seeing farm implement -- up to this point, we saw an increase in farm implement manufacturing and shipments at record levels.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, this drought will provide some degree of uncertainty, but the most important thing is for Congress to take action to provide some direction and assistance so that folks know what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, what kind of protection they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have.\xc2\xa0 That certainty is really important.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s whether they want to get to work on the Food, Farm and Jobs bill, they want to develop a separate disaster program or an extension of existing programs, whatever it might be -- having that done as soon as possible will be quite helpful.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, two questions.\xc2\xa0 Number one, you mentioned farm exports as being a bright spot.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sort of estimates on the amount of reduction on exports for corn and soybeans now, given the drought situation -- even a range?\xc2\xa0 And second, will there be any EPA assessment of the mandate using corn for ethanol?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to go to the EPA at this point in time.\xc2\xa0 Based on the quantity of ethanol that\xe2\x80\x99s currently in storage, there\xe2\x80\x99s no problem in that area at this point in time.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn exports, we would anticipate and expect they would be reduced.\xc2\xa0 But again, the area and the amount of reduction depends on what the yields are, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t know what those are until we, in fact, harvest the crop.</p>\n<p>\n\tBased on what we have today, I would anticipate and expect a small decline, but that could be changed next week if the crop conditions continue to worsen, or it could be improved if we get the right rain in the right places at the right time and the right amount.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Vilsack, going back to the issue of crop insurance, I was told that crop insurance is very expensive, with the premium, maybe for some farmers, $15,000 a year.\xc2\xa0 What happens to those farmers who cannot afford the crop insurance?\xc2\xa0 Those small, minority, women farmers who just can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it -- what is in place or what are you talking about putting in place to help them in the midst of this drought situation?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President was so insistent on taking a look at the interest rate on the emergency loan program that we have.\xc2\xa0 And that basically reduces -- it provides emergency loans to get people through a tough period of time.\xc2\xa0 And the interest rate was reduced from 3.75 percent to 2.25 percent for those producers who are located in counties that have been designated as a disaster area.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the emergency loan is one opportunity.\xc2\xa0 The second opportunity for those producers would be a situation where Congress would provide for a revival of the disaster programs that expired.\xc2\xa0 We had a program last year called SURE that provided supplemental protection; livestock producers had a livestock indemnity program -- they could bring those back.\xc2\xa0 So they could create opportunities within the Commodity Credit Corporation for us to provide financial assistance to those farmers.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole series of options.\xc2\xa0 But right now, the only option we have is to reduce the interest rate on the emergency loan and make sure that haying and grazing is available to livestock producers.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what are you doing to make sure, to ensure -- because right now you\xe2\x80\x99re still dealing with a lot of minority, Indian, and women farmers who are having complaints about the subsidy programs that you offer.\xc2\xa0 What are you doing to ensure that there\xe2\x80\x99s an equitable process that they are able to obtain those loans now?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 We have in place a process by which we compare the amount of loan activity in counties where there are significant percentages of socially disadvantaged farmers or minority farmers to make sure that the amount of loans that are being authorized and approved are roughly equivalent to the percentage of the population of the socially disadvantaged minority.\xc2\xa0 So that we keep engaged and if we see that there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant difference, we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously pay attention to that particular county.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think everybody understands that now it\xe2\x80\x99s all hands on deck.\xc2\xa0 The President is very concerned about making sure we do everything we possibly can to help as many producers as we can through this difficult circumstance.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Based on what you know today -- and understanding it\xe2\x80\x99s imperfect information -- how do you think this drought is going to compare with the \'88 drought?\xc2\xa0 Do you think it could be worse than that?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 If we were comparing it today to potential yields, the \'88 yield would have the corn crop being about 25 bushels less than what we have today.\xc2\xa0 The beans would be roughly five bushels less.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re not at the \'88 level.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s probably a larger area of the country that\xe2\x80\x99s impacted, but the severity is not as deep yet.\xc2\xa0 But every day that goes by without rain, depending upon the state and the condition of the soil, and what was planted and when it was planted -- part of the problem we\xe2\x80\x99re facing is that weather conditions were so good at the beginning of the season that farmers got in the field early.\xc2\xa0 And as a result, this drought comes at a very difficult and painful time in terms of their ability to have their crops have good yields.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sir, could you elaborate on your concerns about short-term gouging or taking advantage of the situation?\xc2\xa0 And at what point in the food chain does that occur?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Well, everybody knows there\xe2\x80\x99s a drought and everybody knows it\xe2\x80\x99s severe, and everybody knows that the corn prices and bean prices have gone up, and that impacts livestock producers in the long term.\xc2\xa0 What folks don\xe2\x80\x99t know is it does take some time for those prices and that impact to be felt.\xc2\xa0 Nor do most people realize how little farmers get out of that food dollar.\xc2\xa0 So even though prices are increasing, it may not translate into significantly higher food costs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRight now we estimate our food inflation rate somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5 percent.\xc2\xa0 In fact, this last month it was at 2.7 percent, which was one-tenth of a percent less than the preceding month.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated.\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated, some people could say, well, this is an opportunity to potentially raise costs now.\xc2\xa0 And we want to make sure people understand that now is not the time that they should see higher food costs.\xc2\xa0 If there are going to be higher food costs, you would likely see them later in the year and in the first part of next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what are you doing -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the Agriculture Department doing, what can it do, to track for this kind of activity?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Well, through a number of nutrition assistance programs, we can kind of keep an eye on what we\xe2\x80\x99re spending and where we\xe2\x80\x99re spending it and whether or not it is historically in the norm.\xc2\xa0 And if it\xe2\x80\x99s not, we can take a look at it.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think the most important thing right now is for consumers to be aware and to keep an eye on it, and begin asking questions -- if they see a dramatic increase in hamburger costs or steak costs -- they should ask, what\xe2\x80\x99s with this?\xc2\xa0 And if someone says it\xe2\x80\x99s the drought, they should push back and say, now, wait a second, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the reason.\xc2\xa0 We should actually -- given that herds are being reduced and potentially liquidated, we should actually be seeing a little lower cost right now.\xc2\xa0 And that pushback may make a difference.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned corn and beans several times.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why the focus on that and not other crops.\xc2\xa0 Is it because they have such a multiplier effect throughout the economy, throughout the food supply?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Not so much that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s primarily the area of where the drought is most severe is primarily where corn and beans are raised.\xc2\xa0 Wheat, somewhat impacted.\xc2\xa0 The biggest other impact is for livestock producers -- hay is obviously going to be much more expensive because there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a lot less of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re deeply concerned about the importance of getting action with our friends in Congress to try to provide some degree of assistance and help.\xc2\xa0 And they have multiple ways they can do that.\xc2\xa0 We just want to encourage them to do it as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, thank you for doing the briefing.\xc2\xa0 I know that the U.S. sells some of the livestock to Russia and probably to other countries.\xc2\xa0 So do you expect an increase in the export of livestock because of this situation?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s conceivable in the short term -- as herds are liquidated, it could provide opportunities with lower costs for us to be even more competitive than we already are in that export market.\xc2\xa0 Frankly, we are looking at record exports, notwithstanding the difficulties we\xe2\x80\x99re facing here.\xc2\xa0 We had a record year last year; we\'re looking at a strong year this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to Russia, hopefully Congress will act and make sure that Russia enters the WTO in a way that allows us to put them in a process where they\xe2\x80\x99re in a rules-based and science-based system.\xc2\xa0 That should increase and should help our export opportunities in Russia, more than just the current situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you talk a little bit about the drought itself?\xc2\xa0 Is it very unusual?\xc2\xa0 Did anyone see it coming?\xc2\xa0 Is it from climate change?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you can do to prepare?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not a scientist so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to opine as to the cause of this.\xc2\xa0 All we know is that right now there are a lot of farmers and ranchers who are struggling.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important and necessary for them to know, rather than trying to focus on what\xe2\x80\x99s causing this, what can we do to help them.\xc2\xa0 And what we can do to help them is lower interest rates, expand access to grazing and haying opportunities, lower the penalties associated with that, and encourage Congress to help and work with us to provide additional assistance.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s where our focus is.</p>\n<p>\n\tLong term, we will continue to look at weather patterns, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do research and to make sure that we work with our seed companies to create the kinds of seeds that will be more effective in dealing with adverse weather conditions.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons -- because they have done that, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why we\xe2\x80\x99re still uncertain as to the impact of this drought in terms of its bottom line because some seeds are drought-resistant and drought-tolerant, and it may be that the yields in some cases are better than we\xe2\x80\x99d expected because of the seed technology.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on Andrei\xe2\x80\x99s question -- just the other way.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it first make sense to increase imports of crops to feed the herds, instead of slaughtering?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s unconventional for this country to think about improving imports instead of supporting more exports, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the margins, particularly for livestock producers, are pretty tight.\xc2\xa0 And those margins don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily -- aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily impacted or affected by importing more costly feed.\xc2\xa0 They have to make a tough decision and a difficult decision, and it\xe2\x80\x99s particularly difficult in light of the fact that the disaster programs that we\xe2\x80\x99re there to protect them under these circumstances -- to give you a sense of this, the disaster programs that we had under the 2008 Farm Bill, for all producers, including livestock producers, provided nearly $4 billion of assistance to 400,000 producers that suffered from floods and droughts and storms and fires and so forth.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that was a significant help to those livestock producers. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have that today.\xc2\xa0 We need something like that, and a lot of vehicles to get it.\xc2\xa0 But in the meantime, I think the producers will make the decision to reduce herds, which is how they normally react to a circumstance like this, so they can minimize what potential loss they may be facing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary, should we be expecting that you and the President will be heading to a drought-stricken area soon?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s normally a path that you take when you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to show something is a priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak obviously for the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, but I can tell you that actually I was in Pennsylvania yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We do have the Deputy Secretary going to Georgia tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got the Under Secretary of the Farm Service Association traveling to several states that are drought-impacted and affected.\xc2\xa0 We have a Deputy Under Secretary also traveling.\xc2\xa0 So we actually are fanning out across the country to get a sense of what the conditions are.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt really is also an opportunity for us to underscore what we have done and what needs to be done, and the help that we need from Congress.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, we\'re going to be continuing to travel throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 I\'m scheduled to go to Iowa next week to talk to Farm Bureau members and I\'m sure that I\'m going to have an opportunity to visit with them about the conditions of the crops in Iowa.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, I want to follow through on the climate change question.\xc2\xa0 Is there any long-range thinking at the Department that -- you had the wildfires and the heat wave and the rise in sea levels, and now this drought -- that there\'s something more going on here than just one year of a bad crop, and you need more than better seeds, maybe do something about climate change?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Our focus, to be honest with you, in a situation like this is on the near term and the immediate, because there\'s a lot of pressure on these producers.\xc2\xa0 You take the dairy industry, for example.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve lost nearly half of our dairy producers in the last 10 years.\xc2\xa0 They were just getting back to a place where there was profitability and now they\'re faced with some serious issues and, again, no assistance in terms of disaster assistance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s our near-term focus.\xc2\xa0 Long term, we obviously are engaged in research projects; we\'re obviously working with seed companies.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t discount the capacity of the seed companies.\xc2\xa0 These technologies do make a difference.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s one of the reasons why, at least based on the yields today, we\'re looking at potentially the third largest corn crop in our history.\xc2\xa0 Now, that may be adjusted downward, it may be adjusted upward -- depends on the rain, depends on circumstances.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But even with the difficulties we\'re experiencing, we\'re still looking at a pretty good crop as of today.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow it could change, obviously.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll take one more for the Secretary.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir, right here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m Dr. Harper, the Intermountain Christian News.\xc2\xa0 And Governor Perry last year had this national day of prayer and fasting, and he was encouraging people to pray and fast in these national disasters.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any figures on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY VILSACK:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can only speak for myself.\xc2\xa0 I get on my knees every day and I\'m saying an extra prayer now.\xc2\xa0 If I had a rain prayer or rain dance I could do, I would do it.\xc2\xa0 But honestly, right now the focus needs to be on working with Congress -- they have the capacity to help these producers by creating greater flexibility to programs, providing us some direction in terms of whatever disaster assistance can be provided.\xc2\xa0 Those are the kinds of things we\'re focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.\xc2\xa0 We appreciate it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going, Jay, to go anywhere --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any scheduling updates for the President to provide to you today.\xc2\xa0 If and when I do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll provide them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe can now return to our regular programming.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A lot to cover on Syria, so a question on that, and then I wanted to squeeze in one on domestic politics.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst of all, on Syria, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard some initial reaction, but one thing I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard is whether the White House condemns the killing, condemns the bombing of the top officials of the Assad regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can say, Ben, is what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along, which is that we do not believe that violence is the answer.\xc2\xa0 And it is precisely because of the ongoing campaign by President Assad against his own people that we are seeing a situation that is getting worse and worse.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that is why it is so important for the international community to come together around a plan that produces the transition -- the political transition that is essential if Syria is to have a brighter future.\xc2\xa0 I think the incident today makes clear that Assad is losing control, that violence is increasing rather than decreasing, and that all of our partners, internationally, need to come together and support a transition.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOne concern expressed by those who have resisted supporting a transition that would see Assad remove himself from power is that it would -- that that outcome would cause the situation to spiral out of control or cause chaos or more violence.\xc2\xa0 And our argument has always been that the situation, as it exists with Assad in power, is what will result in greater violence and in greater chaos.\xc2\xa0 And that is being borne out, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re working with our partners at the United Nations in New York, trying to bring about the consensus that we believe is absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you inform us whether Assad was a target and whether the administration knows where he is now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still gathering details about the incident.\xc2\xa0 Again, all I can tell you is it reflects the fact that the situation is getting more violent every day in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And it only proves a point that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been making that the window is closing; we need to take action in a unified way to help bring about the transition that the Syrian people so deserve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll squeeze in my political question here.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner today, in talking about the President, said, "He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give a damn about middle-class Americans."\xc2\xa0 And I wanted to get your reaction to this in terms of whether you think that this is another day in Washington politics, or whether that kind of comment about the President\xe2\x80\x99s motivations in any way crosses the line.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I had not heard that comment.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus from day one in office has been on the middle class, has been on restoring the security that had been eroding for the middle class for a decade in this country.\xc2\xa0 All of his domestic initiatives are focused principally on the middle class.\xc2\xa0 The proposal that he has been asking Congress to act on immediately is a middle-class tax cut -- a tax cut that would go to 98 percent of American taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 It is the principal preoccupation of his presidency.\xc2\xa0 It is the reason why he ran for this office.\xc2\xa0 It is the reason why he is running for reelection.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is, I think, astounding to hear a criticism like that when you simply bring it back to the policy debate.\xc2\xa0 In an effort to move the ball down the field, if you will, in terms of our economic challenges, the President, acknowledging that there are big disagreements on some issues, did what you do when you seek compromise, which is find common ground.\xc2\xa0 And he said, look, we all support, Republicans and Democrats alike -- at least we all say we support -- extending tax cuts for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Pass those tax cuts now -- the President will sign them into law.</p>\n<p>\n\tI believe Speaker Boehner opposes that.\xc2\xa0 I hope his opposition changes.\xc2\xa0 It is a very difficult argument to make, I think, to middle-class Americans that you believe your taxes should go up unless millionaires and billionaires get a tax cut.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll happily talk at length about the President\xe2\x80\x99s record supporting and helping to make more secure the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to return to Syria for a moment.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any information about who may have been behind the suicide bombing?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen published reports of a group taking responsibility, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other information besides that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in light of the increasing violence in Syria, are you concerned -- how concerned are you about the security the country\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons stockpile?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have, as you know, repeatedly made it clear that the Syrian government has a responsibility to safeguard its stockpiles of chemical weapons and that international community will hold accountable any Syrian officials who fail to meet that obligation.\xc2\xa0 We, the United States, are closely monitoring Syria\xe2\x80\x99s proliferation-sensitive materials and facilities.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that Syria\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons stockpile remains under Syrian government control.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut taking a step back, we have long said that the presence of chemical weapons in Syria undermines -- in Syria and the region -- undermines peace and security, and we continue to call on the Syrian government to give up its chemical weapons arsenal and to join the chemical weapons convention.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you have on the Bulgaria blast that targeted some Israelis?\xc2\xa0 The Israelis are saying apparently that it has all the earmarks of something by Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is obviously breaking news and we are working to ascertain all the facts.\xc2\xa0 But I want to be clear that the United States condemns such attacks on innocent people, especially children, in the strongest possible terms.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts and prayers are with the families of those killed and those injured.\xc2\xa0 We also stand with the people of Israel and the people of Bulgaria in this difficult time.\xc2\xa0 Going forward, the United States will support our friends and allies as they confront terrorism.\xc2\xa0 And of course, our commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security remains unshakable.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, does this look like something that Iran would have done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have information yet on anything specific to the incident itself and if, in fact, it was terrorism and who was responsible for it.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President has been briefed on it, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 First, on the GOP allegations that the Obama administration has "gutted" Medicaid\xc2\xa0 --- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, welfare -- "gutted welfare reform."\xc2\xa0 And I think Romney has also weighed in, saying that President Obama "wants to strip the established work requirements from welfare."\xc2\xa0 And I was wondering what the President or the White House response to those allegations is.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I find that interesting because a cornerstone of the Welfare Reform Act of 1996 -- which I remember well because I covered it -- was the establishment of work requirements for welfare recipients.\xc2\xa0 And those requirements are fundamental to the gains made in the past 15 years in moving people from welfare to work.\xc2\xa0 And this administration opposes any effort to undermine those requirements.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe changes proposed by the Department of Health and Human Services are designed to accelerate job placement by moving more Americans from welfare to work as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0 There will be no waivers of the time limits in the law, and only waivers with compelling plans to move more people off of welfare and into work will be considered.\xc2\xa0 This policy will allow states to test new, more effective ways to help people get and keep a job.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then if I could address some of the hypocritical criticism -- I have been surprised by it -- by the hypocrisy of our critics since many of them have in the past supported and even proposed such waivers.\xc2\xa0 Governor Romney, Governor Barbour, Governor Huckabee, Secretary Tommy Thompson, and Senator Grassley all supported these kinds of waivers for states in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a 2005 letter to the Senate, Republican governors including then-Governor Romney, requested such waivers.\xc2\xa0 Under President George W. Bush, HHS Secretary Thompson put forward a proposal that would allow "super waivers" in the program.\xc2\xa0 The Senate, under Republican control at the time, passed a bill authored by Senator Grassley with broad waiver authority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd just last year, states led by Democrats and Republicans including Nevada and Utah, called for these waivers -- these very waivers so they could have more flexibility to get more people back to work faster.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, given this long, documented history of bipartisan support, it is surprising, to say the least, to see this kind of flip-flopping on the part of Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting that Mitt Romney flip-flopped on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting that everyone I named by name in the past supported these kinds of waivers.\xc2\xa0 And I am also making clear that this administration in no way supports any effort to undermine the work requirements that were fundamental to the Welfare Reform Act signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996.</p>\n<p>\n\tWendell.\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, do you have a second question?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just had one quick one.\xc2\xa0 On the Jobs Council, obviously who haven\'t met formally or publicly for six months -- why exactly is that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President solicits and receives input and advice from members of his Jobs Council and others about economic initiatives all the time.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to the numerous initiatives put forward by the Jobs Council that this administration, under the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction, has taken action on, including a presidential memorandum in August of last year that selected 14 job-creating, high-priority infrastructure projects for expedited review -- four of those are already under construction; in March of this year, just a few months ago, an executive order launched an interagency effort to cut red tape and improve outcomes for infrastructure projects; new federal plan that will require timelines concurrent instead of sequential reviews; early coordination among federal, state, and local agencies to reduce duplication and adoption of other best practices.\xc2\xa0 There are numerous initiatives that have been proposed by the Jobs Council that this administration has acted on, and that will continue to be the case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason they haven\xe2\x80\x99t met publicly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, there\xe2\x80\x99s no specific reason except the President has obviously got a lot on his plate.\xc2\xa0 But he continues to solicit and receive advice from numerous folks outside the administration about the economy, about the ideas that he can act on with Congress or administratively to help the economy grow and help it create jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the violence intensifying in Syria, will the U.S. be prepared if the Assad regime were to collapse in a matter of days?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Your question goes I think to the point I was making earlier about the escalating violence, about the fact that as Assad has stayed in power and continued to perpetrate violence against his own people, that the situation has become more, and not less, chaotic, that the opportunity for a peaceful transition begins to diminish.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we believe that that opportunity still exists.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to come together with our partners internationally, form a consensus that embraces the notion that a transition in Syria is taking place and must take place, and that it cannot include President Assad because he has forfeited long ago any credibility he has with the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we call on our friends and our partners internationally to recognize that Assad is a spent force in terms of history.\xc2\xa0 He will not be a part of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xc2\xa0 And the best possible course of action for every country with an interest in the region and in the future of the Syrian people is to ally with the Syrian people and support a transition that is inclusive and allows for the establishment of a process and a democratic future for Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject, there\xe2\x80\x99s been some Democratic pushback recently on what they see as Republican attempts to basically hold the President hostage to the threat of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that this might have a chilling effect on hiring by defense contractors and others who see us heading ever closer to that fiscal cliff?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position is and has been that Congress needs to do what -- do the work that Congress assigned itself back last summer when it passed, with bipartisan majorities in both the House and the Senate, the Budget Control Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe sequester, which was part of that legislation, was designed to be unpalatable to everyone.\xc2\xa0 It was designed to have cuts that no one supported in both defense spending and in non-defense spending.\xc2\xa0 And it was designed that way precisely because it required -- what was required was the kind of motivation to make some tough choices and tough votes that Congress clearly needs in order to do the right thing, which is embrace a balanced approach to long-term deficit and debt reduction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is an approach the President supports.\xc2\xa0 It is embodied in the proposals he\xe2\x80\x99s put before Congress.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a position that is broadly supported by the American people, by bipartisan commissions like the Bowles-Simpson Commission and the Domenici-Rivlin Commission.\xc2\xa0 It is supported by the so-called Gang of Six. It is supported by all right-thinking people everywhere except, perhaps, in one portion of the Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President believes that the simple adoption of the premise that we need to have a balanced approach so that deficit reduction and debt control is not -- the burden of that is not borne solely by seniors, solely by the middle class, but borne by everybody in a balanced way would move this process forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some signs of recognition that revenues need to be part of the approach on behalf of some elected Republicans, and we hope that we begin to see more of that, because that is clearly what needs to be done and it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly what the American people support.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand the reasoning for the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about concerns about the impact on job creators.\xc2\xa0 Does it trouble you as we move closer to this cliff that defense contractors see huge cuts if Democrats and Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t work it out.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And the President opposes those cuts, does not believe those cuts are wise, they\xe2\x80\x99re too deep.\xc2\xa0 They are not -- they are much deeper than the President has proposed in his budget for a reason.\xc2\xa0 And that is why Congress needs to act to avert the enforcement of the sequester, and there is time for Congress to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, we have been debating these issues and engaging at a deep, substantive level on these issues for quite some time now\xc2\xa0 -- certainly for as long as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in this job.\xc2\xa0 And the result of that is that the work has been done, we know what we need to do, we know what the options are.\xc2\xa0 We know what the Republican proposal is, we know what the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal is. We know what is broadly supported by interested communities around this issue.\xc2\xa0 We know what would help the economy, we know what would harm the economy.\xc2\xa0 And we need to simply accept that compromise requires the kinds of steps the President took to sign into law spending cuts of substantial size -- $2 trillion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt requires embracing the kinds of reforms in our health care entitlements that the President has embraced and put forward.\xc2\xa0 And it requires Republicans to accept the simple proposition that seniors, folks with disabled children, and the middle class should not have to bear the cost of getting our fiscal house in order by themselves; that the wealthiest Americans who have, by comparison with the middle class, done far better over the past decade, ought to do their fair share.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd on the general principle of tax cuts, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that the President simply supports -- as he long has -- the return of the tax rates for the top 2 percent of American earners to the level that was in place in the 1990s under President Clinton.\xc2\xa0 And the beauty of this is now we have an empirical example of what the impact of those tax rates had on our economy, and would have if they were implemented again in the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd although some, including the aforementioned current Speaker of the House, warned about doom and gloom when those rates were put into place by President Clinton in 1993 -- economic Armageddon I think was predicted -- what we got instead was the opposite.\xc2\xa0 We got the longest peacetime expansion of our economy in history.\xc2\xa0 We got 23 million jobs created.\xc2\xa0 And the middle class saw its positioning made more secure \xe2\x80\x93 middle-class incomes actually went up.\xc2\xa0 And millionaires and billionaires did pretty darn well also.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a recent example that should help guide us into the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me try one more if I can.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wheaton College, an evangelical school in Illinois, is joining Catholic groups in their lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s contraceptive requirement.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to -- I mean, our position is as it was, but I am not aware of that report.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.\xc2\xa0 And then Norah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on Wendell\xe2\x80\x99s line of questioning on the sequester.\xc2\xa0 Does the President or does the administration think it would be appropriate to negotiate legislation to avoid a sequester in a lame duck session?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that Congress should act now to render moot the sequester by passing balanced deficit and debt reduction.\xc2\xa0 If Congress doesn\'t do that now, it must do that after the election.\xc2\xa0 But that is the course of action that needs to be taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\'s an alternative --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They simply can\'t -- the alternative is to ignore a problem that is easily fixable.\xc2\xa0 And Congress promised before the nation, when bipartisan majorities in both Houses voted for the Budget Control Act, that they were not going to do that; they were going to embrace the challenge and come together and pass legislation that could garner bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And the only legislation that can garner bipartisan support is legislation that addresses our fiscal challenges in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what they have to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President would oppose a short-term extension?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to negotiate what may or may not happen in December.\xc2\xa0 What I will tell you is the President\'s position is clear about what Congress needs to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick follow -- and it just came across the wires\xc2\xa0 -- the President has apparently spoken with Vladimir Putin.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any sort of readout on that?\xc2\xa0 The topic was Syria, as we understand it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any additional information for you, except I can confirm that the President did speak with President Putin.\xc2\xa0 But I\'ll have more information for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe that was a topic of discussion, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, he called him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 President Putin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who called who?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe we initiated the call, but I will have to double-check.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 The first is Mitt Romney\'s campaign and its allies have been trying to make hay out of the fact that a lot of companies with connections to Obama donors have received grants and loans, loan guarantees from the Energy Department.\xc2\xa0 The question is whether you think it\'s -- is there anything wrong with a company or an individual who has supported the President politically also receiving government support for their endeavors?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think these charges have been appropriately labeled by some of your colleagues as ridiculous, totally false, unfounded.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\'re labeling them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We certainly believe that and know that.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is these programs, a principal one of which was started under the Bush administration, gave out loans on a merit basis.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s been well established.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRepublicans in the House have been investigating this stuff for more than a year.\xc2\xa0 And you know what they got so far?\xc2\xa0 Nothing, because the program, again, was -- the loans are assigned on a merit-based basis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have long acknowledged that one of the reasons why -- and this was true under the Bush administration when one of these programs was established -- that you create these investment programs to invest in industries that might not otherwise get that seed money that they need to grow and that, inherently, there is some risk involved in that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the broader principle here is that we need to build those industries in the United States, because they will be vital industries in the 21st century and if we don\'t build them here, they will be built in China or Europe or India or elsewhere, and jobs will be created in China or India or Europe or elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 And this President was not willing to cede these key 21st century industries to the Chinese or the Indians or the Europeans or others.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that was why he made the investments through the Recovery Act that he did.\xc2\xa0 Those investments have supported hundreds of thousands of jobs.\xc2\xa0 And, even more significantly, they have helped clean energy industries here in the United States expand and place roots into the American economy in a way that will continue to pay dividends economically for years to come.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My second question, following up on Donovan\'s question about the Jobs Council -- I\'m wondering if it\'s at all awkward for the President to be campaigning against recommendations that the Jobs Council made, such as the territorial tax system.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 I think we made clear when the Jobs Council was created, these are outside advisors who, by design, come from different areas of the economy and they bring different views, and they are not members of the administration.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the whole purpose of it.\xc2\xa0 And the President wanted this outside input and he wanted to evaluate ideas.\xc2\xa0 And, obviously, he will embrace and support some of them -- and he has, as I began to speak about earlier -- and others, he won\'t support.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the territorial tax system that you reference, the President doesn\'t support that because, as was demonstrated in a report published in Tax Notes earlier this week, it would create a situation where jobs are created overseas rather than in the United States.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it stands to reason if you give a tax incentive to companies to build factories overseas, they\'re going to do that, and the jobs that come along with that will be created overseas.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does that say about your Jobs Council, if they were promoting an idea that would be so harmful?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It says that the President has received many fine ideas from the Jobs Council that he agrees with and he supports, and that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with and support every idea that everybody has put on the table.\xc2\xa0 Because he has to balance the various interests that are at stake when he looks at what\'s best for the American economy, what\'s best for the middle class, what\'s best for manufacturing here in the United States, and what approaches are best to encourage companies to build factories in the United States, open offices in the United States, and hire American workers.\xc2\xa0 That is his focus, and that has driven his economic proposals and it is driving his economic vision for the next four years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, so Speaker Boehner -- and I know you said you hadn\'t heard his comments -- but he also -- you said in response to his comment that Ben talked about that it\'s important to look at the policy debate.\xc2\xa0 That\'s also part of what the Speaker was saying.\xc2\xa0 He was saying that the President\'s campaign is not focused on the policy debate -- they\'re focused on Governor Romney\'s tax returns.\xc2\xa0 And he called this a distraction.\xc2\xa0 He said the President is trying to distract the American people.\xc2\xa0 If you\'re looking at priorities based on rhetoric, does he have a point that that\'s an attempt at distraction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And I would refer campaign-specific questions to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 But the President\'s priorities -- and you hear him talk about it everywhere he goes, both when he is having official events and when, as yesterday, he has campaign events -- and he talks very specifically about concrete economic proposals and his vision for helping the economy grow and helping secure the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the debate about encouraging insourcing, as opposed to encouraging outsourcing, is fundamental to economic policy and the kinds of choices we need to make going forward.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s one that I think illustrates a real difference between the President and, unfortunately, the Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, here is a proposal that is currently being discussed on Capitol Hill and the Senate about eliminating loopholes that exist in our tax code that encourage companies to take jobs overseas.\xc2\xa0 Now, we shouldn\'t be doing that.\xc2\xa0 Why would Congress want to encourage companies to send jobs overseas?\xc2\xa0 We should be taking action to encourage companies to build and invest here in the United States and create jobs here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the President\'s position.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s embodied in the proposal that he has put forward that the Senate is considering.\xc2\xa0 And it makes no sense to him, or to me, that Republicans wouldn\'t support that.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, there has been opposition to that.\xc2\xa0 We hope it can be overcome.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it just sounds like the President -- you\'re saying the President isn\'t focused on this line of attack, because it\'s his campaign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I didn\'t say that at all.\xc2\xa0 I said one of the issues that\'s being debated in the campaign as it relates to the President\'s opponent has to do with vision and what policies he is for with regards to outsourcing versus insourcing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But also the tax returns is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, one of the issues that I think -- again, I think you ought to take specific questions about Governor Romney and the campaign to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 But what the President believes --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\'s a firewall?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are issues that I think are best addressed by the campaign.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you what the President believes and what his positions are.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you on the issue of his policy positions on outsourcing and insourcing, and the distinctions that exist between his position and Governor Romney\'s.\xc2\xa0 He feels very strongly about that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he is pushing them so hard, both on the campaign trail and in Congress.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd when it comes to transparency and accountability, the President believes that that comes with the office.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he has said -- and I will quote him -- that when you\'re President of the United States, you are responsible and you live by the adage that Harry Truman coined, that "the buck stops here."\xc2\xa0 And the whole debate about whether -- when you\'re President of the United States, you can\'t say, well, I know I have the title but I\'m not really responsible for what happens here in the White House or in the federal government, I was doing other things -- you are responsible, and the President believes that very strongly.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if you\'re going to run for President, it\'s not necessarily comfortable, but it\'s become a tradition and it\'s an important one, you make your tax returns available because you think the American people deserve that kind of transparency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, I\'m speaking for the President.\xc2\xa0 If you have questions about how the campaign specifically is addressing these issues, you should take them to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 But the President -- his record demonstrates that and he very much supports it.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I want to follow up on a question about Wheaton College.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve actually -- we\'ve filed a story on this, Wheaton College joining Catholic University in a lawsuit --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just got this question and I don\'t have -- I\'m not even aware of it, so I\'ll have to take the question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\'s pretty simple -- they\'re joining Catholic University.\xc2\xa0 There are many institutions that are suing over this.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering if there\'s a concern that this is sort of just a sign of just a sign of more to come.\xc2\xa0 The administration has already lost the support of its key ally, the Catholic Health Association.\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern that there is more to come?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, when this was a topic of discussion earlier this year, was committed to finding a balance between religious liberty -- which he has a strong attachment to and belief in -- and the need to ensure that women had access to important preventive services, including contraception.\xc2\xa0 And he made sure that that balance was struck in the policy that is moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the position he\xe2\x80\x99s taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- in terms of the iterations of developments in court cases, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the specific case or the fact that this college is involved in it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just it.\xc2\xa0 This is the premier evangelical institution in the U.S. joining a lawsuit.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a development?\xc2\xa0 How does it register?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly a development if CNN has done a story on it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) But the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It broke an hour before the briefing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A whole hour?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yep.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that as a matter of principle, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on this event since I was informed about it by one of your colleagues earlier. What I can tell you is that the President believes very strongly in finding the balance that he believes he found and the administration found in putting forward the policy that\xe2\x80\x99s put forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd on specific legal actions, I would have to take the question -- or probably refer you to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Syrian opposition has been vocal in their criticism of the Obama administration, saying that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been doing enough and basically, all that they\xe2\x80\x99re receiving is rhetoric that President Assad has to step down.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that the United States has led the effort to organize the international community to try to unify the international community in support of both the Syrian opposition, but more broadly the Syrian people and the whole premise that there needs to be a transition in Syria without President Assad.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur very clear position on the brutality that Assad has perpetrated, the fact that he long ago gave up any opportunity to participate in a transition to democracy in Syria, has been vocal and clear.\xc2\xa0 And it is not -- it is a simple fact that at the United Nation, efforts that we supported and led to pass resolutions that would have -- that we believe were the correct ones against Assad, were not supported by Russia and China.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about our disappointment in that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to work with the Russians and the Chinese to try to persuade them that history is not on the side of those who would ally themselves with President Assad; that it is in the interest of peace, it is in the interest of the Syrian people, and it is in the interest of those nations that want a continued relationship with Syria and the Syrian people to support a transition in Syria that does not include President Assad.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you mean by when you say "transition"?\xc2\xa0 You often said that from this podium.\xc2\xa0 What do you mean by "transition"?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We mean, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen elsewhere, there has to be a process that -- a transition period that allows for the interim government, if you will, that allows for the establishment of a new democratic process in that country that would eventually --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- include this current regime?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Our point is without this regime -- I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s the point we\xe2\x80\x99ve been making -- that Assad cannot participate in that process because he has lost all credibility with his people by the simple fact that he has gone around the country killing innocent Syrian civilians.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you just said you are pursuing --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You are pursuing the situation with the United Nations right now.\xc2\xa0 What is your strong leverage to use against Russian veto today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are in regular conversation with the Russians and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made our positions clear.\xc2\xa0 And our point to the Russians and others is that, as I just said, if you ally with Assad, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to end up on the wrong side of history, and that a continued relationship with Syria and the Syrian people I think depends upon making the right decisions now, because Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future will not include Assad.\xc2\xa0 Syrians need to be able to determine their own future in a democratic way.\xc2\xa0 And it is in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the region and beyond to support a process that allows for that process to take place, that responds to the legitimate democratic aspirations of the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:44 P.M.
