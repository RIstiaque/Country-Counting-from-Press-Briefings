EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, as we begin our trip to Africa.\xc2\xa0 I know that you\'ve been briefed and given a preview of the trip, so I won\'t repeat that.\xc2\xa0 But the President, as you just can tell, is looking forward to this visit.\xc2\xa0 Africa is an incredibly important region of the world.\xc2\xa0 A high number -- I forget what it is -- of the top 10 fastest growing economies in the world are in Africa.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have significant economic and trade interests in Africa, as well as national security interests.\xc2\xa0 And for all those reasons, this is a very important trip that we\'re looking forward to.\xc2\xa0 And with that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to start off, you know we\'re going to have this gay marriage announcement imminently.\xc2\xa0 Are you planning to have any sort of reaction to that here on the plane or what\'s the response planned?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure that we will have a reaction.\xc2\xa0 And if there is a decision at the normal time, we\'ll likely have a reaction from here before too long, before we land.\xc2\xa0 With all decisions, we have to be afforded the time to evaluate the opinions before we offer an assessment.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\'t look for us to have an immediate reaction, but we\'ll certainly have one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he come back or will it be a paper statement?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 At this point, I would expect a paper statement.\xc2\xa0 But anything is possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any calls to readout at all -- on the Snowden situation -- that the President may have had?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no information on the Snowden story beyond, I think, what is publicly known.\xc2\xa0 We still believe that he is at the airport in Russia.\xc2\xa0 We noted the statements by President Putin and the Foreign Minister.\xc2\xa0 We certainly understand the fact that Mr. Snowden chose to travel to Moscow, chose to travel to Russia creates issues that the Russian government has to consider.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We also believe that when it comes to Mr. Snowden, well, we agree with President Putin that we don\'t want the situation to harm our relations, I would note that we have improved, as I did the other day -- significant and improved cooperation with the Russian government on matters of law enforcement, especially in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings.\xc2\xa0 And I would note that we are asking the Russians to expel Mr. Snowden, and that we believe there is a clear, legal basis to do so, based on his travel documents and the indictment against him.\xc2\xa0 But we have no updates on those circumstances at this time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow real quick on that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you making any efforts beyond that statement describing "clear legal basis" for returning Snowden to persuade the Russians, to coax the Russians to return him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are having conversations with Russian government officials.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not at liberty to get into the details of those conversations, but we\'re having the conversations.\xc2\xa0 And I think that what I just said reflects the general tenor of the conversations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say at what level those conversations are taking place?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the individuals.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there are a variety of people in our government and the Russian government under whose jurisdiction these issues fall.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the trip, last week during the briefing, Ben said that businesses want to get in the game in Africa.\xc2\xa0 What specifically are they looking for from the administration that would help them get in the game?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as you\'ve heard us say about Asia, we had a circumstance in the first decade of this century where our intense focus on the Middle East had an unintended consequence that resulted in us not being as engaged in Africa, just as we were not as engaged in Asia as President Obama believes we need to be.\xc2\xa0 And you\'ll hear, during the course of the trip, some of our ideas about ways that we can enhance and deepen our economic and trade relationships in Africa, our ideas for how to increase American investment in Africa and American opportunities in African economies.</p>\n<p>The added value that the United States brings is sort of the mode of our engagement, because we believe that engaging in Africa -- as with other regions of the world -- economically has a name, not just for the economic advantages and benefits that it provides, but the fact that we can assist Africa through that engagement in lifting up the quality of life of people of African nations and enhancing their progress towards democratization.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Can I follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 You guys are in year five I guess of the administration.\xc2\xa0 There is some criticism from people on the African continent and elsewhere that the administration is too late to this thinking, that the engagement should have taken place and people expected it would have, given President Obama\'s sort of personal connections to the continent as well.\xc2\xa0 Given what China is doing and everything else, is the United States too late?\xc2\xa0 And is that criticism of you guys fair?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are not too late and nor are we just engaging now.\xc2\xa0 It is true that this is only the President\'s second visit to Africa, but it is his second visit to Africa as President.\xc2\xa0 He made a brief visit in 2009, I believe, to Ghana.\xc2\xa0 But our engagement with Africa and our stepped up engagement as a country in Africa has occurred over the course of President Obama\'s time in office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I, as communications director for the Vice President, traveled to Africa with the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 And of course, there have been engagements at a variety of high levels of the Obama administration throughout President Obama\'s time in office.\xc2\xa0 But what I won\'t contest is the sort of underlying premise of your question, and that is that there is great merit in engaging, in American engagement in Africa and that we certainly don\'t have any time to lose in making that engagement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about what this trip means personally for the President -- he has his extended family here it looks like -- and also, along the lines of this, what he wants his legacy to be in Africa?\xc2\xa0 Is he thinking about that?\xc2\xa0 That\'s been something that has been really important to both President Clinton and President Bush.\xc2\xa0 And as far as I see here, he is not going to announce any major initiatives at this point along the lines of what those Presidents did.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that he is hoping to do with the time he has left in office?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say, starting from the backend of your question that this trip, while important -- and presidential trips to regions of the world like Africa bring enormous benefits in terms of our relationship with the countries visited and the countries in the region -- the trip itself will not be the end point of our engagement, but will enhance it, deepen it and further it as it grows over the rest of the President\'s time in office.</p>\n<p>On the personal aspects of it, I think I\'ll defer to him.\xc2\xa0 You\'ll have the opportunity on I think three occasions we have press availabilities with the President.\xc2\xa0 He has obviously written a fair amount about it himself in terms of his family ties to Kenya and to the African continent.\xc2\xa0 But other than that, he is the best person to address the personal nature of the trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 He is visiting Gor\xc3\xa9e Island off of the coast of Senegal, a site that has particular resonance for any Americans, particularly African Americans.\xc2\xa0 What\'s that visit going to be like?\xc2\xa0 Does he intend to give a speech there?\xc2\xa0 How is this particularly important for this President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have more details about the schedule to give to you and the sort of symbolic meaning of -- a visit like this by an American President any American President, is powerful.\xc2\xa0 And I think that will be the case when President Obama visits and I\'m sure particularly so, given that he is African American.</p>\n<p>On this issue, I think it\'s especially appropriate to hear from him.\xc2\xa0 And I know he\'ll address it both in the press availabilities if you ask him and in other contexts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In light of the decision that we are waiting on from the Supreme Court, in his bilateral meetings, will the President address social issues with especially the President of Senegal?\xc2\xa0 It\'s a criminal act -- homosexuality is a criminal act in Senegal.\xc2\xa0 And will this be a topic of conversation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule it out.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get ahead of the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 But the issues you raise with regard to the criminalization of homosexuality are significant.\xc2\xa0 And you can assume that that\'s something that is both a concern to the President and the administration, and that would be something that we would discuss.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said on Monday that the Snowden affair would unquestionably hurt U.S.-China relations.\xc2\xa0 China is saying it\'s going to have no impact at all.\xc2\xa0 How to expect this damaged trust to manifest itself in U.S. comments and U.S. policy?\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. going to take a formal measure to display its frustration over this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not in a way that I can announce today.\xc2\xa0 I would simply point you to the comments I made and others about our view of the opportunity China had in our assessment that there was no reason for Hong Kong not to detain Mr. Snowden.\xc2\xa0 All the procedures were followed.\xc2\xa0 And certainly, as I said the other day, we certainly don\'t accept the proposition that China -- that this was just a technical issue, that China could not have had an effect on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does this unquestionably damage our relationship with Russia, this situation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that we are in conversations, as you would expect, with the Russian government.\xc2\xa0 Circumstances are different in that there is no extradition treaty.\xc2\xa0 And we understand that the arrival of Mr. Snowden in Russia creates issues for the Russian government to consider.\xc2\xa0 We have made clear that there is a legal basis, a clear legal basis for Russia to expel Mr. Snowden, in our view.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve made that view known and are now having conversations accordingly.\xc2\xa0 But as of now, we have no updates on that circumstance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you\'ve said that you\'re wishing for his recovery and you\'re in touch with family members.\xc2\xa0 What is the current situation in terms of what your knowledge is about --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no updates on President Mandela\'s condition that go beyond what we\'ve heard from the South African government.\xc2\xa0 We continue to pray for him and his family, and obviously all of the South African people to whom he means so much as well as his admirers around the world.\xc2\xa0 And at this time, we just don\'t have any new information.\xc2\xa0 And we simply hope that he recovers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on voting rights, I know the President -- you guys issued a statement saying the President was dismayed by it yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything more that you can say about his reaction or what he hopes will happen in Congress or elsewhere?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the statement reflected his deep disappointment and his expectation that Congress will take action to address the situation in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling.\xc2\xa0 This is something that I expect he might be asked about over the course of this trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A legislative effort that he can lead, that he can try to push?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he has signaled pretty clearly yesterday where he stands on it.\xc2\xa0 And strategy is not something I\'m prepared to lay out today, but he obviously believes it\'s important, as we all do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that subject, Jay, as a result of the Supreme Court decision, a number of states are now free to enact voter ID laws -- states including Louisiana, South Carolina, other southern states.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any concern specifically about those voter ID laws going into effect?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything he would intend to do in response?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is concerned about efforts, generally speaking, that have the result of restricting the ability of Americans to exercise their right to vote are always of a concern.\xc2\xa0 We made that clear last year, and that remains the case.\xc2\xa0 We should be, in the President\'s view, taking steps to make it easier for American citizens to exercise their fundamental right and efforts that have the result, whether intended or not, of restricting that right or making it more difficult to exercise that right do harm to our democratic process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing -- so the information recently surfaced that the IRS was also targeting liberal groups, groups with names like "progressive" and other things in their title.\xc2\xa0 So in light of that, does the President feel that the IRS was unfairly or too harshly criticized for what it was doing and that the senior leaders of the IRS were perhaps dealt with too harshly?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President felt very strongly that the inappropriate use of criteria or inappropriate criteria to target conservative groups or any groups needed to be corrected and was a problem.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President met with Secretary Lew and Principal Deputy Commissioner -- I think that\'s his title now, Werfel, the other day to be briefed on Mr. Werfel\'s 30-day review.\xc2\xa0 And he is pleased to see and continues to want to see progress made on the objectives that Mr. Werfel laid out.</p>\n<p>I think the broader issue here -- as has been pointed out by some of your colleagues -- is that there\'s been a lot of flagrant, unfounded accusations made by members of Congress in the Republican Party about this issue, accusations that were made without factual foundation.\xc2\xa0 But I guess the facts have told a different story.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t10:00 A.M.
