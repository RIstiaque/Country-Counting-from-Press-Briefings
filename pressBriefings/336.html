Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:55 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I just want to do two quick things before I go to your questions.\xc2\xa0 The first is you\'ve had an opportunity to hear from the President about the recently released video from ISIL.\xc2\xa0 This is something that the intelligence community is continuing to work to authenticate, as the President alluded to. As they have been for some time, our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the family of Lieutenant Kasasbeh and with the Jordanian people. The Jordanians have been stalwart members of this broader international coalition that\'s executing a strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to stand with them even in this very difficult, tragic time.</p>\n<p>One other thing I want to also mention is I want to commend to your attention a statement from the President\xe2\x80\x99s top counterterrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco.\xc2\xa0 She made reference to the fact that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence put forward a report today.\xc2\xa0 This is a report that was directed by the President in Presidential policy guidance -- or Presidential Policy Directive 28, related to signals intelligence activities. This report was issued at the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction to make public the progress that the intelligence community is making on reforming some of our signals intelligence activities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is a process that\'s been informed by experts both inside and outside of the government.\xc2\xa0 And what the report indicates is that the progress the IC is and will continue to make on these reforms will help chart a path forward that should give the American people greater confidence that their rights are protected, while preserving important tools that keep us safe, and addressing significant questions that have been raised overseas.</p>\n<p>Now, there are two other things that I want to make clear about this.\xc2\xa0 The first is, now that this report has been made public, the President wants people to take a look at it, particularly those who\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed a strong opinion on it.\xc2\xa0 And the President intends to meet with some of the experts that he met with last year to discuss the findings of the report and to discuss additional steps that can be taken to make further progress on these reforms.</p>\n<p>The second thing is this is not just the first report from PPD 28 -- as my friends in the national security bureaucracy call it -- it\xe2\x80\x99s actually going to be the first annual report, that the President intends for them to be some important follow-through here and that in having an annual evaluation of the progress of these reforms, the President believes is important to holding the national security apparatus accountable for striking the appropriate balance between protecting our national security and protecting the civil liberties of the American people, and obviously recognizing the significant questions that have been raised about people overseas.</p>\n<p>So I would certainly commend to your attention the statement from Ms. Monaco, as well the report itself that\'s been put out today.</p>\n<p>So with that, Nedra, why don\'t we get to your questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the Jordanian pilot was, indeed, killed by ISIL, does that change or impact the hunt to rescue the American woman and other hostages that are still being held there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does not, Nedra, and for one simple reason, which is that the President has already ordered his team to devote all of the available resources that we have to trying to locate anybody -- but particularly Americans -- who are being held hostage by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And we have made clear that the President is willing to devote significant diplomatic intelligence, even military resources, to trying to secure the release of our citizens that are being held against their will.\xc2\xa0 And that is an effort about which we continue to be vigilant and the President receives regular updates on the progress of those efforts, and we\'re going to continue to be.</p>\n<p>You already know that White House officials are in close touch with the families of those who are being held against their will in Syria by ISIL, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be.\xc2\xa0 And certainly our thoughts and prayers are with them, as well.\xc2\xa0 They\'re going through what is I think an unimaginable tragedy, and our thoughts are with them, as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since the President weighed in on Sunday encouraging parents to vaccinate their children, other elected officials have also spoken about this.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think it\xe2\x80\x99s irresponsible for elected leaders not to be definitive about the need to vaccinate children?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think that -- I know that this has been bandied about a little bit in the context of some presidential politics for 2016, and I\'m not going to avail myself of the opportunity to weigh in on the comments of others. I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on this are clear, and if given the opportunity to do so, he will repeat his urgent guidance that parents across the country have a responsibility to get their kids vaccinated against the measles.</p>\n<p>And the reason for that is failing to do so only puts at risk those families that have small children who can\'t be vaccinated against the measles until they\xe2\x80\x99re 12 months old, or also puts at risk those children who have compromised immune systems that also can\'t get the measles vaccine.</p>\n<p>So that\'s why the President believes that parents do have a responsibility here, and it\'s a responsibility not just for their own kids but for kids in their community.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because of that risk to the vulnerable population, does he believe that it\'s time to revisit state laws that allow some parents to opt out?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that there has been substantial litigation around this, too.\xc2\xa0 I think in the mind of the President -- I did have the opportunity to visit with him shortly before the briefing on this very issue -- the President believes it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t require a law for people to exercise common sense and do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is the right thing for them to do both by their own children, but by also other children in the community.\xc2\xa0 They have a responsibility to do this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the fact is the only reason that people would even consider the option of not getting the measles vaccine for their children is that we have actually succeeded in making the measles virus very rare, that they feel like they are not at risk at catching measles so that\'s why they don\'t have to get the measles vaccine.\xc2\xa0 But the truth of the matter is the only reason that the measles virus is relatively rare is because everybody has been getting the vaccine.</p>\n<p>So there is an element of common sense that needs to be applied here because the science and the expert guidance that we get from our public health professionals is crystal-clear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one other topic -- does the President plan to sign the bill to improve mental health services at the VA?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 This is something that the administration strongly supports and the President will sign it.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back on ISIS.\xc2\xa0 The King of Jordan, King Abdullah, is in town today.\xc2\xa0 Will the President or anyone else from the White House be meeting with him?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe that he was slated to have lunch with the Vice President today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether or not -- I believe it was scheduled to take place right now.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if the King\xe2\x80\x99s schedule has changed or not.\xc2\xa0 But obviously the President and the Vice President both value the strong personal relationship they have with King Abdullah, and the strong partnership that the United States has with the nation of Jordan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, there are 60 nations that are part of this broader international coalition that is executing a strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Jordan has made substantial contributions to that international coalition.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the reason that we\'re discussing the welfare and the apparent killing of this one Jordanian military officer is that there are Jordanian military pilots that are risking their lives to carry out airstrikes against ISIL targets in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And they are doing it alongside American military pilots.\xc2\xa0 And that is an indication of the substantial contribution that Jordan is making to this effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given what\xe2\x80\x99s just happened with this hostage, would that be something that might be added to the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule since the King is in town?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any changes in the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule at this point, but if something like that does occur, we\'ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you describe how and when he was informed about the video?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know exactly how.\xc2\xa0 I know that he was shortly before all of you saw him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a separate topic, can you give any more details about the administration\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about Ukraine and what kinds of weapons you might be considering sending to the opposition?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good question, Jeff, and there has been, I know, some coverage of this in the last few days.\xc2\xa0 I will say a couple things about it.\xc2\xa0 The first is some of that coverage leaves some with the impression that there\xe2\x80\x99s not been military assistance that\'s already been provided by the United States.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s important to note that the United States has already provided $118 million in security assistance to help Ukraine in their ongoing efforts.</p>\n<p>That security assistance includes a wide variety of things, everything including body armor, helmets, vehicles, night and thermal vision devices, heavy engineering equipment, advanced radios, demining equipment, portable explosive ordinance disposal robots, patrol boats, counter-mortar radars, and other items that are required to sustain Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s defense and internal security operations.\xc2\xa0 So there already is substantial military assistance that has been provided to Ukraine.</p>\n<p>The question that some people have raised -- and even, I think, the suggestion that some have raises -- is that that military assistance should be augmented.\xc2\xa0 And what we have said throughout this situation in Ukraine that\'s been going on for almost a year now is that we\'re continually evaluating our strategy and our response with essentially two goals.\xc2\xa0 One is to isolate Russia\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership for the decisions they\xe2\x80\x99re making to destabilize the situation in Ukraine, and also to take steps to support our friends in Ukraine that are going through a very difficult time.</p>\n<p>And that support takes a variety of forms.\xc2\xa0 It includes the military assistance that I detailed.\xc2\xa0 It also includes economic assistance in the form of loan guarantees, some of which have already moved through Congress.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that just a couple of weeks ago the administration called on Congress to pass an additional $1 billion in loan guarantees that could benefit the Ukrainians.\xc2\xa0 Their economy has taken a hit from this instability as well, and we want to do what we can, working with the international community, to try to offer them some needed assistance.\xc2\xa0 But if there is more that we can do that makes sense in the context of our strategy, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll consider doing that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it is the view of the United States that this situation will be resolved diplomatically, that the idea that somehow the United States can offer enough assistance to the Ukrainians to put their military on par with the large Russian military is unrealistic.\xc2\xa0 So what we ultimately need to do is we need to have put enough pressure on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership, do enough to support our friends in Ukraine to ultimately bring about the kinds of diplomatic negotiations that are capable of resolving the instability in that country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Just one more on a final topic.\xc2\xa0 The EPA weighed in with its assessment of the Keystone pipeline today, saying that it would, indeed, have effects on climate change.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this basically show that the President\xe2\x80\x99s test on whether or not to approve Keystone will not be fulfilled?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I did see the letter that the EPA put out today.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to comment on this process, or at least the substance of this process until the State Department has concluded their broader review to determine whether or not this project going forward is in the national interest.</p>\n<p>So certainly the President has laid out his own clear criteria about how he believes the project should be evaluated. And as part of the process of collecting input from relevant agencies across the federal government, the EPA put out their own supplemental environmental impact study and that will be a part of this ongoing process at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge the outcome of that process until the State Department has had an opportunity to evaluate the input from all of the federal agencies.</p>\n<p>Okay.\xc2\xa0 Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the veto threat remains on that bill as well, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that that veto remains in place is because it would circumvent this well-established process for determining whether or not this project is in the national interest.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And back to ISIS.\xc2\xa0 We heard the President say today, I think it will redouble the vigilance and determination on the part of the global coalition to make sure that ISIS is degraded and ultimately defeated.\xc2\xa0 Redoubling the efforts of the coalition.\xc2\xa0 Why would the President say that in relation to this latest video?\xc2\xa0 And is it because you see this as some kind of ramping up in ISIS\xe2\x80\x99s violence or propaganda?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Tragically, Michelle, this is the kind of violent act that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen all too many times in recent months from ISIL.\xc2\xa0 These kinds of acts only expose the bankrupt and depraved ideology of the leaders of that terrorist organization. And it is acts like this that only serve to galvanize the international community and redouble our commitment to the strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99re employing to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we will see more on the part of the coalition -- is that what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly adding more to the coalition is always an option.\xc2\xa0 I think the President was mostly referring to, though, the international community\xe2\x80\x99s commitment and determination to working together to solve this problem.\xc2\xa0 And when I say solve this problem, I mean degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And the timing of this is interesting given the visit of the Jordanians here today.\xc2\xa0 Do you have reason to think that ISIS is watching these moves and acting because of that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to possibly imagine why anyone would resort to a tactic like this, let alone filming it and releasing it.\xc2\xa0 And so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to understand what\xe2\x80\x99s going through their minds.</p>\n<p>What I can tell you is if it is part of an effort to weaken the international community\xe2\x80\x99s resolve, I feel confident in standing before you today and telling you that the release of this video is going to have the opposite of that intended effect; that the international community and certainly the United States -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the other members of the coalition speak for themselves -- that our determination is only strengthened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And timing as well -- the Jordanians say that this pilot was actually killed on January 3rd.\xc2\xa0 Were you aware of any of that possibility before?\xc2\xa0 And what does that say about the hostage negotiations and attempts that had been going on and those attempts in general?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, this video is something that is still being evaluated by the intelligence community, and certainly questions about when this video might have been recorded will be among the questions that will be considered by the intelligence community, and so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of their assessment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Quickly, because vaccines came up, it was 2008 that the President said that the science was inconclusive.\xc2\xa0 So the difference now -- does he believe something has changed in the research that would make that not the case?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we do know that at the time that the President was speaking, there was a study that has since been debunked that indicated that there might be some connection between autism -- or increasing rates of autism and vaccines.\xc2\xa0 But, like I said, since that time -- I believe this was in 2010\xc2\xa0 -- that study was retracted because it was completely undermined based on additional scientific data that had been presented.\xc2\xa0 So, in the mind of the President, this is an issue that science has settled and that it is clearly the responsibility of parents all across the country to get their kids vaccinated for the measles.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Lisa Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s statement this morning on the report, she refers to another report that would be coming out in the coming days on big data.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- can you give me any timeline on that, what that means, any preview?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You can look for that sometime before the end of the week, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t preview it at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mr. Viqueira.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, back on vaccines.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been reported that people who have dug through the budget found that the so-called 317 program on immunizations has been cut in the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal by 8 percent, some $50 million.\xc2\xa0 If the President believes that everybody should get vaccinated, why would he cut that program?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mike, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you asked that question.\xc2\xa0 And the reason is that we can take away funding for that program because of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 The Affordable Care Act actually guarantees that every citizen in this country has access to free preventative care, including the measles vaccine.\xc2\xa0 So we no longer need to provide additional government funding to ensure that those vaccines can be administered.\xc2\xa0 This is a great example of how the Affordable Care Act is actually cutting costs not just for families and businesses all across the country, but also for the federal government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And yet the CDC, in its recommendation on the budget, asked for not less money but more money.\xc2\xa0 Are they unaware of the beneficial effects of the Affordable Care Act as you\xe2\x80\x99ve described them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them about why they believe additional funding is necessary.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is no longer -- to the extent that anybody was using money as an excuse to not get their kids vaccinated, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, they don\'t have to worry about that anymore; that people who are covered under the Affordable Care Act through essentially getting health insurance through the marketplaces, we have required that those insurance programs include free preventative coverage, including vaccinations like those against measles.\xc2\xa0 So that is one of the other benefits of the Affordable Care Act -- both in terms of reducing costs, but also in terms of making people healthier.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think this should be federally mandated, vaccines across the country for this set and other sets of childhood diseases?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Major, we do have a tradition and there\xe2\x80\x99s a long track record in this country of these kinds of health issues being administered by state and local officials.\xc2\xa0 This is something that we went through at the end of last year related to Ebola, that the monitoring that was in place was something that was strongly recommended by federal public health officials at the CDC, but ultimately, we are relying on state and local partners to carry out that monitor.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is a good indication of how federal public health officials and state and local public health officials work together; that the federal government can be relied upon for good scientific advice -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole wealth of institutional knowledge that\'s contained at the CDC, that there are significant resources that are devoted by the federal government to doing the kind of research at the NIH and other places where we can make sure that the best scientific advice that is known to man can be made available to state and local public health officials -- and ultimately that\'s the way that this system has operated for generations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should it change?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I also know is true is that there is a lot of case law around this, and this is something that people have challenged I think on both sides of this issue.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned earlier, I did have a chance to speak to the President about this issue shortly before the briefing, and he was clear that we don\'t need a new law, we need people to exercise common sense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The federal government does not need to establish a mandate for vaccines, just recommendations and advice to states and parents on the facts?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what the President is saying is we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to, that the science is clear.\xc2\xa0 And it is irresponsible for people to not get their children vaccinated -- not only because it puts their children at risk of getting the measles, it also puts at risk other children in their community, if it\xe2\x80\x99s infants who are too young to get the vaccine, or children who have compromised immune systems that they can\'t get the vaccine.\xc2\xa0 So people need to take responsibility -- not just for their kids, but for the kids in their community.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up on Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s question on Ukraine, because when you said if the issue is to put the Ukrainian military on par with the Russian military, that\'s unrealistic.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s the general sense -- that\'s what you said.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are those who would argue that\'s sort of a straw man, that that\'s not what those who are recommending an increased allocation, or an initial allocation of lethal military aid to the Ukrainians are proposing.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not saying you need to make the Ukrainian military as strong as Russia.\xc2\xa0 You just need to make it formidable enough to inflict costs in the area where the civil strife is occurring to get the Russians to think differently about their actions.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to evaluate the question on that basis.\xc2\xa0 Where does the administration come down on that particular piece of advice that serious people, who are friends of this administration, are giving to you in stronger words than they ever have before?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that there are people who are making a variety of recommendations to the administration.\xc2\xa0 So there are -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a straw man to suggest that there are some people who say we should just arm the Ukrainian military so they can push back the Russian military.\xc2\xa0 And it is the assessment of our national security team that the Russian military is large enough and sophisticated enough that the idea that we\'re going to put the Ukrainian military on par with the Russian military is unrealistic.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is that the only option?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 There clearly is advice that we\'re getting from others -- they\'re making that advice public -- about other strategies that we could implement.\xc2\xa0 And this is consistent with the kind of reassessment and revaluation that\'s always ongoing here.\xc2\xa0 So certainly we\'re going to take that kind of advice to heart.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time that it\xe2\x80\x99s been considered.</p>\n<p>What is also true, though, is that we also have a sanctions regime that is in place that so far has not succeeded in prompting the Putin regime to change their behavior in Ukraine, that they continue to destabilize that situation.\xc2\xa0 They have not taken the necessary steps to deescalate the situation in Ukraine. But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that every day that goes by, the costs associated with that sanctions regime only increase.\xc2\xa0 And the isolation that Russia suffers as a result of their behavior only increases.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if our only option moving forward is to augment our military assistance.\xc2\xa0 What is also true on a daily basis is that the costs that are imposed on Russia increase every single day that Russia fails to live up to the commitments that they have made to deescalate the situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since this is getting a fresh assessment or reassessment here, talk to us about the risk involved that the administration sees of lethal aid to the Ukrainians, that it could provoke an even greater, more hostile, more aggressively military response from the Russian separatists being financed and directed and resupplied by Moscow.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the first thing that we always consider in these situations is providing additional military assistance could and is likely to have the effect of increasing the bloodshed.\xc2\xa0 That\'s actually the thing that we\'re trying to avoid.\xc2\xa0 So we want to try to bring both sides to the negotiating table so this can be resolved.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\'s the only that this is going to get resolved, because, as I mentioned earlier, a military resolution in which the Ukrainian military is built up sufficiently to push back militarily Russian forces across the border is not realistic.\xc2\xa0 And so ultimately that means we\'re going to need a diplomatic resolution to this situation.\xc2\xa0 That means negotiations, and those negotiations will be predicated on trying to stabilize the situation there and to end the bloodshed.\xc2\xa0 And there is a risk -- I think a very real risk -- that adding additional military resources only expands the likelihood of bloodshed there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to this question of vaccinations.\xc2\xa0 I understand the President\xe2\x80\x99s position is clear, everybody should get vaccinated. It\xe2\x80\x99s common sense.\xc2\xa0 But there are -- is a significant percentage of families that are not getting their kids vaccinated, and an increasing percentage.\xc2\xa0 So the question, which I\xe2\x80\x99d like to follow up Major\xe2\x80\x99s very direct question, see if I can get a direct answer, is does the President believe that it should be mandated by law, whether state or federal?\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe it should be mandated by law that parents get their children vaccinated?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have not in the couple hours we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing this here this morning had the opportunity -- when I say discussing it this morning, I mean discussing it among our staff, not in this context.\xc2\xa0 But when we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing it, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had an opportunity to sort of -- I at least haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the opportunity to review all of the built-up case law over this.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that there are people on both sides of this issue who have filed lawsuits and suggested that -- made arguments to the court that the federal government does have this authority.\xc2\xa0 Some have made arguments that the federal government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>I think in the mind of the President, this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is -- this also goes to Nedra\xe2\x80\x99s original question -- this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be about politics.\xc2\xa0 This is something very basic and fundamental about science and about the need for American citizens to act responsibly to protect their own kids, but also to protect the kids in their community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so, again, I think in the mind of the President, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that should come down to whether or not a federal law should be passed.\xc2\xa0 This comes down to a simple question about whether or not parents across the country are going to act responsibly and do the thing that science tells us will better protect their kids and kids all across the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what has brought this up in a political context is you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a couple of prominent Republicans who have said that, yes, everybody should be vaccinated against measles but parents should have a choice.\xc2\xa0 So the question is that second part.\xc2\xa0 Because in the first part they agree entirely with the President. Should parents have a choice, or should they be forced because of a larger public health interest to have their kids vaccinated?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think in the mind of the President, this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a difficult choice.\xc2\xa0 The science is really clear about what we need to do to protect our kids and to protect kids all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And, again, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about politics.\xc2\xa0 This is about common sense, and the President believes strongly that parents should exercise that common sense in a way that ensures that their children get vaccinated on time so that we can make sure that kids across the country -- particularly those kids that are still under the age of 12 months and they can\xe2\x80\x99t get vaccinated for the measles, there are some kids who are undergoing cancer treatments that prevent them from being able to get vaccines -- the thought that a child who is already suffering from cancer and is fighting cancer and therefore can\xe2\x80\x99t get the measles vaccine would contract measles because of the irresponsibility of another child\xe2\x80\x99s parent is unthinkable.\xc2\xa0 And I would hope that we would have enough sense all across the country that we would take politics out of this and we would focus on the science to do right by our kids.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then just one other topic.\xc2\xa0 You may have noticed there was a story in The New York Times today about a prominent governor who received some rather lavish gifts from a foreign leader.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just wondering, as a principle, what the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position is on whether or not foreign leaders should be able to give -- or it is wise for prominent political leaders in this country to accept rather lavish gifts from foreign leaders.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are, as you point out -- I guess as you alluded to, Jon, that there is a federal law that prevents federal officials from taking gifts from foreign leaders.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, each individual person who is being gifted something by a foreign leader, regardless of the position that they hold in the state and local government, will have to decide for themselves whether or not it\'s appropriate to accept gifts like that.</p>\n<p>Okay.\xc2\xa0 Fred.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday the President said a couple times during his speech that -- calling on Republicans not to endanger national security with the DHS funding.\xc2\xa0 These employees -- of course, I can see how someone would find that objectionable to make Border Patrol agents work without paychecks for a while. But does this really endanger national security?\xc2\xa0 Because they will still be working.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Fred, I think it\'s a very difficult for anybody to make the case that it\'s actually good for our national security to not fully fund the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 And the case that the President was making is similar to an argument that you heard from one of my colleagues at the briefing we did on the budget just yesterday -- that failure to provide the kind of certainty that leaders at the Department of Homeland Security need to invest in new programs and to invest in equipment does have an impact on national security.\xc2\xa0 And so we certainly are mindful of that, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful, again, that Republicans will not withhold funding from the Department of Homeland Security just in a fit of pique over the President taking executive action to add some accountability to our immigration system.</p>\n<p>So I also certainly think it would be pretty tough for anybody on the Republican side to say that not paying our law enforcement officials is in any way good for those law enforcement officials, and I\'m not sure that you could really make the case that that\xe2\x80\x99s good for our national security either.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, not good, but does it actually harm if we --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Homeland Security who could explain to you how the short-term nature of the funding that Congress has been providing to the Department of Homeland Security does have an impact on their ability to plan and to invest in other new programs -- that if they\xe2\x80\x99re only getting funded 30, 60, 90 days at a time, that that\xe2\x80\x99s not the kind of certainty that they need so they can plan to deploy -- well, so they can implement the budget in a way that will maximize their ability to keep the American people safe.</p>\n<p>And again, I have a hard time imagining what kind of case Republican would make to say that withholding funding from our federal law enforcement officers is good for national security.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just get some clarity on what you were talking about earlier -- I apologize if you already made it clear -- but as far as Chris Christie, Rand Paul were saying that they\xe2\x80\x99re for these measles shots, they question the mandate.\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t made totally clear whether you support a mandate.\xc2\xa0 So where does the President -- specifically, where does he differ from Governor Christie and Senator Paul?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to those two gentlemen to articulate their own position.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the President\xe2\x80\x99s position here that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need a federal law; people should just use common sense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support a mandate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been as clear as I possibly can be on all this.</p>\n<p>Kevin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 How would you describe the President\xe2\x80\x99s level of concern for the millions of Americans who will be facing a looming tax bill because of Obamacare?\xc2\xa0 And what do they think can the administration do to provide relief or help to those people who are probably going to be hit in a way that they don\xe2\x80\x99t expect?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\'s accurate to suggest that millions of people are going to get a tax bill as a result of this.\xc2\xa0 The fact is millions of people all across the country have gotten a tax break that has made their health care more affordable -- or their health insurance more affordable.\xc2\xa0 That is a benefit of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>And the vast majority of Americans, more than three-quarters of Americans, are just going to have a box to check on their tax form to confirm that they have health insurance.\xc2\xa0 And so the impact that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here is very small and for the vast majority of people has been very positive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But for the millions that will?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what statistic you\xe2\x80\x99re citing when it comes to millions.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that that\xe2\x80\x99s accurate at all.\xc2\xa0 I can certainly cite for you the statistic that indicates that millions of people have gotten a tax break to make their health insurance more affordable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me go at it a different way then.\xc2\xa0 As Congress considers once again to chip away, or at least make a stand -- albeit one that will likely end up like the previous stands -- do you at least recognize why they continue to do this, why this continues to be such an important element in their leadership as they try to once again pull back the reins on what they think is runaway government?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, the Affordable Care Act is a reform of the private health care system.\xc2\xa0 So I recognize that Republicans make think there\xe2\x80\x99s a political benefit to saying things that just aren\xe2\x80\x99t true about the health care system in this country, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a conclusion they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to arrive at on their own.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is Republicans who want to vote for the 55th time, hoping that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be more successful this time -- 54th or 53rd or whatever it is -- to repeal the Affordable Care Act should understand exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99re taking away.</p>\n<p>They\xe2\x80\x99re taking away tax credits from millions of working families who are trying to afford their health insurance.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re taking away common-sense protections that ensures that people can get preventative care like the measles vaccine for free.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re taking away protections that prevent insurance companies from discriminating against people that have preexisting conditions.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m not really sure why Republicans think that that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea.\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you were saying, again just to make sure I\'m clear, it\'s not millions that will be impacted with a tax bill.\xc2\xa0 Whatever that number is, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing the administration can do to help those people?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\'m saying is that millions of people have gotten a tax break that has made their health insurance more affordable thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Kris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just follow up really quickly on the ACA.\xc2\xa0 If it\'s not about politics, it\'s about common sense, then does common sense dictate that, especially given the outbreak of measles, that children who have not been vaccinated should not go to school?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that there are a variety of state laws all across the country in which some states do mandate that, that children are required to get the measles vaccine before they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to attend school.\xc2\xa0 So, again, this is a state and local issue.\xc2\xa0 In the mind of the President and certainly in the mind of the scientific experts in the federal government, every child should get the measles vaccine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up again on the coalition and this latest ISIS video and your position obviously that was expressed by the President just a short time ago, that this is, in fact, not going to weaken the coalition, it will in fact embolden it.\xc2\xa0 But what do you base that on?\xc2\xa0 And is there concern that, whether through public pressure in those countries or just the horror, that there will be a weakening of the coalition?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that certainly here in the United States there\xe2\x80\x99s been no weakening in our resolve to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the coalition.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And each of those countries should speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0 But I feel confident in certainly indicating that the vast majority of the members of this coalition share the values of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And they understand that the depraved ideology that\xe2\x80\x99s being advanced by those in ISIL is one that the international community needs to confront, degrade, and destroy.</p>\n<p>And this vivid illustration of just how bankrupt their ideology is I think only steels the resolve of every member of the coalition.\xc2\xa0 But they should all speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly think that if there are doubts about that, that you can ask them to find that out.\xc2\xa0 But I feel confident in saying that this is a pretty clear illustration of why it is so important for the international community to take this as serious as we do and to act accordingly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to parse words, so I just want to make sure -- you used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe vast majority.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Would that suggest that you are aware that there are some concerns that could --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It just suggests in my mind that those countries should speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0 But I feel very strongly that -- you can ask them.\xc2\xa0 But certainly here in the United States and under the leadership of this President, our commitment is only steeled when we see illustrations like this.</p>\n<p>Olivier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a couple for you.\xc2\xa0 First, does the President think that skepticism in vaccines is in any way related to skepticism about climate science?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think in the mind of the President -- well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask him this question, so let me just speak for myself, which is I\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure why people would suggest that it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea for their kids not to get the vaccines, particularly a vaccine for a disease like the measles that is highly contagious and one that\xe2\x80\x99s very dangerous.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is we have made tremendous progress in not eradicating that disease but certainly in limiting the number of people in this country, at least, who are affected by it.\xc2\xa0 And that is a testament to the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made through scientific exploration and it certainly is an endeavor that has had significant benefits for people all across the country.</p>\n<p>But as long as there is a population of people who don\xe2\x80\x99t get that vaccine, that disease becomes more dangerous and it puts even more children at risk.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s just common sense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then one related to the announcement where you called the intelligence bureaucracy or national security bureaucracy -- I was recently at the --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that in the pejorative way that you might.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was recently at the Spy Museum, where an exhibit on bugged phones is illustrated with a portrait of Angela Merkel.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I was wondering what today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement means for particularly foreign leaders who might be concerned that the United States is peeking into their emails or listening to their phone calls.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the report itself for those kinds of details.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say something that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, I just want to maybe do the foolhardy thing and swing back to what Rand Paul and Chris Christie said.\xc2\xa0 I understand that you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make this into a political issue, but I am wondering from kind of a public health standpoint if it\xe2\x80\x99s counterproductive for top elected officials, people who on TV and in prominent positions to be saying things like what we heard from Rand Paul yesterday.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President certainly does believe that this is not about politics, and he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of everybody to do right by their kids and to do right by the kids in their community, and that is to get the measles vaccine for their kids.\xc2\xa0 And the science on this is clear.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what should guide these kinds of the decisions, not political positioning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the reason that you\xe2\x80\x99re kind of sidestepping that question concern from the White House that your statements on this could kind of polarize this on partisan grounds?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do think that -- I think there are a variety of reasons why I\xe2\x80\x99m reluctant to go in the direction that you are suggesting that I should go.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I think the most important one is I would not want anyone who is watching this briefing or reading the transcript or, more likely, reading the coverage of our conversation to come away with the impression that there is somehow a Democratic and Republican divide about the wisdom of getting your kids vaccinated for the measles.\xc2\xa0 There is not.\xc2\xa0 The science is clear and it is common sense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it is up to people across this country to do the right and responsible thing by their kids and by the kids in their community, and that\xe2\x80\x99s to get their kids vaccinated for the measles on time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one quick thing on Jordan.\xc2\xa0 I know that you guys are going to -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that after the video that you\xe2\x80\x99d develop more resources to finding hostages held by ISIS.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what\xe2\x80\x99s new about that or what\xe2\x80\x99s different about that from --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, actually, I think what I said in response to Nedra\xe2\x80\x99s question is that there\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily anything different that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do because we\xe2\x80\x99re already devoting every element of our influence and power as the greatest country in the world to try to track down Americans who are held against their will by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The President has dedicated significant diplomatic resources, intelligence resources, and even occasionally military resources to rescuing American hostages who are held against their will.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing.</p>\n<p>Anita.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a slightly lighter note --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 It has been a little heavy today.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought you would appreciate it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky are having an event tonight at the Willard Hotel -- this is real.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re looking at me like I\xe2\x80\x99m making it up.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not, just that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, they are sending bourbon up to Washington. And if you\xe2\x80\x99ll just allow me to read a quote from the Lieutenant Governor:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s just offer wishes that the contents of this barrel thaw the cold ranks of partisanship\xe2\x80\x9d -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t even say it -- \xe2\x80\x9cand serve as an elixir that heralds a new day of progress in our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Capital.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re calling it the \xe2\x80\x9cBourbon Barrel of Compromise,\xe2\x80\x9d and they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it because they got the idea from the President and Senator McConnell talking about the \xe2\x80\x9cbourbon summit.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So I wondered -- I guess you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard about it -- if anyone from the White House was going and what you thought of it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s lighter?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lighter than vaccinations and videos.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think my first reaction is that somebody clearly spent a lot of time writing that statement.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) And that\xe2\x80\x99s time well spent.\xc2\xa0 They did an excellent job whoever that was.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of anybody at the White House who is planning to attend, but maybe there is somebody that\xe2\x80\x99s higher on the food chain than me that got invited.\xc2\xa0 And so if I hear of anybody at the White House that attended, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can get a readout of the event early to you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And your thoughts on trying to -- and on a little serious note here -- I mean, they have asked -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the White House, but they did ask people on Capitol Hill to come, both parties, trying to break the ice a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Thoughts on --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No pun intended?\xc2\xa0 Get some ice broken there as they drink the bourbon.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No respectful person would put ice in bourbon.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Breaking the ice, bipartisanship?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything, even if it is lighthearted and social, like an event like the one you described is an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to shed their partisan warrior gear and spend some time, even lightheartedly, interacting with one another, I think that can only be a good thing.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When is the bourbon summit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said on previous occasions, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily suggest that one sort of social event is going to cause a bipartisan breakthrough to occur, but it certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t hurt.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to work on getting the \xe2\x80\x9cBourbon Summit\xe2\x80\x9d on the books.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Angela.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Shortly before the briefing began, AP reported that there was a compromise reached in the talks with Iran.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on that?\xc2\xa0 And presuming that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, does that increase the chances from the President\xe2\x80\x99s 50/50 projection for a deal being reached?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those reports actually, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check and see if we can get you a comment on those by folks who have had a chance to take a look at it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then going back to Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s questioning on King Abdullah, why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the President on the King\xe2\x80\x99s schedule in the first place when he was coming to town?\xc2\xa0 I understand he was having lunch with the Vice President, but he often is a visitor here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He is.\xc2\xa0 And the King was just here at the White House at the end of last year when the President did have the opportunity to meet with him then.</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly sort of what went into trying to coordinate the schedules of those two busy world leaders, but this time there has not been a plan for the President to meet with him.\xc2\xa0 I have seen some reporting to indicate that the King is planning to attend the National Prayer Breakfast tomorrow, and as you know, the President is planning to attend, so there\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility they may see each other there.\xc2\xa0 If that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know about that, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thursday.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thursday.\xc2\xa0 I keep saying tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Wishful thinking on my part.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Paul.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on what Major was saying about aid to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 You said the possibility that there could never be enough aid to match what the Russians have.\xc2\xa0 Back during the 1980s that very same argument was made after the Soviets went into Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That argument was actually dismissed and they sent in with the Stinger missiles and such.\xc2\xa0 And the theory was that it would be enough to at least make the Soviets uncomfortable about the presence that eventually it would work.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think your strategy now is better?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, given all that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been going through in Afghanistan over the last decade and a half, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to make the case that what anybody did in Afghanistan has worked, at least when it comes to advancing our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my first reaction.</p>\n<p>The second one is simply I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any quibbling with the fact -- and I think even the people who are making the case that Major cited, that even those individuals acknowledge that this will ultimately be resolved diplomatically.\xc2\xa0 And that is the strategy that this President has chosen to pursue, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of our national security and, frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the Ukrainians as well.\xc2\xa0 And so there\xe2\x80\x99s a variety of ways that we can offer our support to them both economically and militarily, including the provision of some important military equipment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Russians were not pushed diplomatically last time.\xc2\xa0 They were pushed by military force.\xc2\xa0 Again, the question is, why is it different and better, your strategy now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that there is anybody who would hold up Afghanistan, particularly given all that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through over the last decade and a half, as a model for confronting the Russians.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that what it -- the strategy that we have in Ukraine is one that is predicated on protecting this core principle, which is respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries.\xc2\xa0 And the United States has worked effectively to mobilize the international community to stand up for this principle.\xc2\xa0 I guess this would be the other difference between the situation that we face in Afghanistan and the situation we face now.</p>\n<p>The situation in Afghanistan broke down along the battle lines of a Cold War in which you had a variety of countries that were allied with the then-Soviet Union and a variety of countries that were allied with the United States.\xc2\xa0 Right now you essentially have the broader international community allied with the United States and the Ukrainian people as they confront the isolated Russia.\xc2\xa0 And I think that materially changes the dynamic of that specific confrontation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the other thing that is clear is that our strategy of isolating them and putting economic pressure on them has yielded results in that it is very clear to President Putin and other members of the political leadership in Russia that their activities in Ukraine have had negative consequences for their economy -- significantly negative consequences for their economy. And every day that goes by that Russia fails to live up to their agreements those costs economically only increase.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 His latest approval, though, is 85 percent.\xc2\xa0 So where\xe2\x80\x99s your evidence that his position has softened?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the evidence that I have is that you have -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of evidence, most of it economic in nature, and I think most of it with numbers that are probably more reliable than a public poll in Russia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The best -- the most recent data is this ruling -- or this decision by the central bank in Russia to lower interest rates substantially just a week or so after raising interest rates substantially.\xc2\xa0 This is an indication that the Russian economy is in significant turmoil, if not chaos.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\'s the result of a lot of things, including the lower price of oil, but it has certainly been worsened by the sanctions regime that\'s been put in place by the United States, working closely with our international partners.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more real quick.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why does the President think that an economic embargo against Cuba hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked after 50 years, but sanctions against Russia -- a large and pretty much self-independent country -- will succeed?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess there\xe2\x80\x99s a big difference between 50 years and nine months.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the first difference.</p>\n<p>The second difference is we have succeeded in building a broader international coalition to put in place a sanctions regime against Russia in a way that isolates them.\xc2\xa0 But the United States\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to isolate Cuba were not successful because just about every other country in the Western Hemisphere had relations with Cuba, so the fact is we had a scenario where the United States and our policy towards Cuba was only interfering with our ability to build strong relations with other countries in the hemisphere.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And by dropping -- or moving to normalize our relationship with Cuba, we\xe2\x80\x99ve removed that distraction and now only increased the pressure on Cuba in a way that will isolate at least a scrutiny of their policies of not respecting the basic human rights of their people.</p>\n<p>Dave.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I wanted to ask you about Social Security.\xc2\xa0 In the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal yesterday, he proposes moving money from the Social Security retirement fund into the disability fund because it\xe2\x80\x99s running out of money even faster.\xc2\xa0 This is something House Republicans have said they will not do.\xc2\xa0 So, first of all, how willing -- how far are you willing to take that disagreement this year with them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple things, Dave.\xc2\xa0 Making that one minor change to the Social Security program would ensure its solvency for another 15 or 20 years, up to like 2033, I believe.</p>\n<p>The second thing is this is a change that Democrats and Republicans have acted in bipartisan fashion many times to protect the solvency of the Social Security trust fund.\xc2\xa0 And that is something -- I think there are 10 or 11 times that we can point to just in the last 20 years or so where that change has been made, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that we would expect Democrats and Republicans would act together on this time, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, in previous years, the President has proposed measures that would extend the life of the retirement fund, like chained CPI.\xc2\xa0 No proposal like that this year.\xc2\xa0 Why not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re certainly open to that conversation with Republicans if they want to have a genuine conversation about strengthening Social Security.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something the President has been committed to since he ran for this office.\xc2\xa0 But, frankly, we\xe2\x80\x99ve not gotten a lot of serious willingness on the part of Republicans to engage in that conversation.\xc2\xa0 But if there are some Republicans who decide they did want to have a conversation about what we can do to strengthen Social Security, then we\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to have that conversation.</p>\n<p>John.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a conference on countering terrorism, which is set for February the 18th, I think.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s countering extremism.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, in the wake of the terrible video that has come out today from ISIS and the instances of other public -- at least seen on video -- executions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past few weeks, with those Japanese hostages, will the focus of this conference be on violent Islamic extremism?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 John, the focus of this conference will be on ensuring -- there is this persistent problem that the President has been concerned about for some time, this issue of foreign fighters and the success that organizations like ISIL have had in radicalizing people all across the globe.\xc2\xa0 And we want to work -- there are communities in this country where law enforcement officials have worked successfully with community leaders, many in the Muslim community, to counteract those efforts to radicalize vulnerable young people, in most cases.\xc2\xa0 And so this would be an opportunity, a forum where the President could discuss those efforts with community leaders and law enforcement officials from across the country so they can share those kinds of best practices with leaders in other communities.</p>\n<p>There also will be an opportunity for representatives from foreign countries to participate because, after all, it is a broader international effort to counter this issue -- or the threat of foreign fighters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that just for the second time in the history of the United Nations the President convened a meeting of the United Nations Security Council.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s specifically because he wanted other world leaders to come and sit at the same table literally to talk about what they could do as an international community to present a united front and prevent foreign fighters, individuals who have been radicalized, from traveling to Syria, getting training, getting access to weapons, and then returning home to carry out acts of violence.\xc2\xa0 And there is important international cooperation and coordination that needs to take place, and there was a good venue for discussing that at the United Nations Security Council last fall, and the President is looking forward to that discussion continuing at the summit that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be convening here at the White House next week -- or two weeks from now, I guess.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just so I\xe2\x80\x99m clear, as it relates to this upcoming conference, will the focus -- the primary focus be on the issue that I just spoke of, the violent Islamic extremism?\xc2\xa0 Will that be the primary focus?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, we certainly have significant concerns -- and they are well-justified -- about the kind of radicalization efforts that are being targeted at the Muslim community, and that there are Muslim children, in particular, who are at grave risk.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re not the only ones at risk.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about other violent extremists who are not Muslim who have carried out acts of violence in this country and we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in countering those as well.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised if anybody thought that was not a worthy endeavor.</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, going back to the budget and ISIS.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked by several people today about increasing the effort against ISIS, but in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget released yesterday we saw a decrease in the amount of funds directly toward that particular mission.\xc2\xa0 So two parts of this question.\xc2\xa0 When was the book closed on this?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing like most of the items in the budget, several months ago, so maybe it reflects an older understanding of the threat in Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 So when was that closed?\xc2\xa0 And will the President\xe2\x80\x99s AUMF, whenever he does put it to Congress, reflect different numbers?\xc2\xa0 Should we expect to see different numbers going along with the authorization?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jared, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that at the end of last year, we had a long discussion about the need for Congress to pass additional funding for our ongoing efforts against ISIL. I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with OMB, based on the calculations that you\xe2\x80\x99ve cited.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely accurate to suggest that we\xe2\x80\x99ve reduced funding somehow for ISIL, but there may be an element to this accounting that I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of because it may be an issue where there were investments that were made this year on the front end that don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily need to be continued because that early investment was made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with OMB on this.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that our strategy and our resolve is certainly not diminishing or is diminished in any way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any expectation of a timeline for when that authorization will be sent to Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any timeline to share with you at this point, but it continues to be the subject of active, ongoing conversations here inside the administration and with members of Congress in both parties who are interested in this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more quick one on the vaccines.\xc2\xa0 I know a lot of people have taken a crack at this, but you had a conversation, you said, with the President just before the briefing.\xc2\xa0 If the President could give -- and obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re speaking to you today, he\xe2\x80\x99s had a few chances -- but since we\xe2\x80\x99re not asking the President questions right now on this today, what would be the President\xe2\x80\x99s direct message to parents who are considering not vaccinating their children or who have not vaccinated their children?\xc2\xa0 As Jon mentioned earlier, that\xe2\x80\x99s an increasing number every year.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Use common sense.\xc2\xa0 Follow the science.\xc2\xa0 Vaccinate your kids.</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post\xe2\x80\x99s editorial page said the administration has passed on the gas tax, evidently unpersuaded by what Jeff Zients had to say yesterday.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I thought he gave a great answer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know that\xe2\x80\x99s not your preferred option for funding the infrastructure, but could you talk a little bit about why you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good time for a gas tax hike, given the drop in gas prices?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One is, first of all, we believe that we just have a better strategy, that closing corporate tax loopholes and using that money to invest in the kind of infrastructure that we all benefit from I think makes a lot of sense.\xc2\xa0 It has a lot of appeal, I think, certainly to the President and to other people in the administration.</p>\n<p>I think the second thing is we also just need to be aware of the challenges associated with trying to fund infrastructure through the gas tax.\xc2\xa0 Thanks in no small part to some of the initiatives that the President has put forward, we\xe2\x80\x99re finding that the fleet that\xe2\x80\x99s on the road right now is more fuel-efficient, which means that they\xe2\x80\x99re using less gas, which means that the gas tax is a less reliable source of that kind of funding.</p>\n<p>So we have put forward a pretty aggressive strategy that would fund a strong six-year investment in our infrastructure that would go 30 or 40 percent over and above current plans for infrastructure investment.\xc2\xa0 And this would have a significant benefit in terms of creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 It would arguably have an even more important benefit of putting in place the kind of modern infrastructure that our economy will need to succeed for decades to come.\xc2\xa0 So the President believes that this is a worthy investment.</p>\n<p>The good news is there is bipartisan agreement that investment in our infrastructure is a worthy investment.\xc2\xa0 That all said, what Mr. Zients said yesterday bears some repeating, which is that the administration has not put forward and does not plan to put forward a proposal to increase the gas tax.\xc2\xa0 But there clearly is building bipartisan support for doing that and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep our eyes open and consider ideas that are put forward by Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill -- even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not the elegant, wise solution that the administration has put forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your former Transportation Secretary floated an idea of dealing with the deficiency by maybe taxing driving by miles instead of by the gallon and that got shot down in about a nanosecond.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It did.\xc2\xa0 By him, I think.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I think by your predecessor.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I think \xe2\x80\x9ccheck back with him\xe2\x80\x9d I think is what Robert Gibbs said.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But does the administration just have a soft spot when it comes to taxing driving?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that just politically toxic for you guys?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that this has much to do with the politics because the idea of investing in infrastructure is something that has bipartisan support; there are different ideas for how exactly to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 And this administration has put forward an idea by essentially closing a loophole that allows corporations to benefit from stashing some of their profits overseas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Corporations who don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily use the roads or bridges.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, but I think in some ways this is also an issue of fairness.\xc2\xa0 Middle-class families don\xe2\x80\x99t have the benefit of being able to stash their profits overseas.\xc2\xa0 Middle-class families have got to keep them in a bank account here in the United States and they\xe2\x80\x99re subject to taxation.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that just out of a matter of fairness, corporations should have to do the same thing.</p>\n<p>I also would make clear that this is the context of a broader business tax reform proposal that would also serve to remove the incentive for corporations to stash profits overseas in the first place.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a likelihood that that would have good benefits for the economy, too.\xc2\xa0 It certainly would make our tax code more fair, and that is something the President is very interested in.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:56 P.M.
