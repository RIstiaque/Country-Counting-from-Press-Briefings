EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Before I answer a few questions, I just wanted to say a few words about the agreement we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached on tax cuts.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My number one priority is to do what\xe2\x80\x99s right for the American people, for jobs, and for economic growth.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m focused on making sure that tens of millions of hardworking Americans are not seeing their paychecks shrink on January 1st just because the folks here in Washington are busy trying to score political points.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And because of this agreement, middle-class Americans won\xe2\x80\x99t see their taxes go up on January 1st, which is what I promised -- a promise I made during the campaign, a promise I made as President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because of this agreement, 2 million Americans who lost their jobs and are looking for work will be able to pay their rent and put food on their table.\xc2\xa0 And in exchange for a temporary extension of the high-income tax breaks -- not a permanent but a temporary extension -- a policy that I opposed but that Republicans are unwilling to budge on, this agreement preserves additional tax cuts for the middle class that I fought for and that Republicans opposed two years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll cite three of them.\xc2\xa0 Number one, if you are a parent trying to raise your child or pay college tuition, you will continue to see tax breaks next year.\xc2\xa0 Second, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a small business looking to invest and grow, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a tax cut next year.\xc2\xa0 Third, as a result of this agreement, we will cut payroll taxes in 2011, which will add about $1,000 to the take-home pay of a typical family.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this isn\xe2\x80\x99t an abstract debate.\xc2\xa0 This is real money for real people that will make a real difference in the lives of the folks who sent us here.\xc2\xa0 It will make a real difference in the pace of job creation and economic growth.\xc2\xa0 In other words, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal for the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I know there are some who would have preferred a protracted political fight, even if it had meant higher taxes for all Americans, even if it had meant an end to unemployment insurance for those who are desperately looking for work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I understand the desire for a fight.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sympathetic to that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m as opposed to the high-end tax cuts today as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been for years.\xc2\xa0 In the long run, we simply can\xe2\x80\x99t afford them.\xc2\xa0 And when they expire in two years, I will fight to end them, just as I suspect the Republican Party may fight to end the middle-class tax cuts that I\xe2\x80\x99ve championed and that they\xe2\x80\x99ve opposed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep on having this debate.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep on having this battle.\xc2\xa0 But in the meantime I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to play games with the American people or the health of our economy.\xc2\xa0 My job is to do whatever I can to get this economy moving.\xc2\xa0 My job is to do whatever I can to spur job creation.\xc2\xa0 My job is to look out for middle-class families who are struggling right now to get by and Americans who are out of work through no fault of their own.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A long political fight that carried over into next year might have been good politics, but it would be a bad deal for the economy and it would be a bad deal for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And my responsibility as President is to do what\xe2\x80\x99s right for the American people.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a responsibility I intend to uphold as long as I am in this office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that, let me take a couple of questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been telling the American people all along that you oppose extending the tax cuts for the wealthier Americans.\xc2\xa0 You said that again today.\xc2\xa0 But what you never said was that you oppose the tax cuts, but you\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to go ahead and extend them for a couple years if the politics of the moment demand it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering is when you take a stand like you had, why should the American people believe that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to stick with it?\xc2\xa0 Why should the American people believe that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to flip flop?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Hold on a second, Ben.\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the politics of the moment.\xc2\xa0 This has to do with what can we get done right now.\xc2\xa0 So the issue -- here\xe2\x80\x99s the choice.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very stark.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t get my preferred option through the Senate right now.\xc2\xa0 As a consequence, if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get my option through the Senate right now, and we do nothing, then on January 1st of this -- of 2011, the average family is going to see their taxes go up about $3,000.\xc2\xa0 Number two:\xc2\xa0 At the end of this month, 2 million people will lose their unemployment insurance. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I have an option, which is to say, you know what, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep fighting a political fight, which I can\xe2\x80\x99t win in the Senate -- and by the way, there are going to be more Republican senators in the Senate next year sworn in than there are currently.\xc2\xa0 So the likelihood that the dynamic is going to improve for us getting my preferred option through the Senate will be diminished.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got an option of just holding fast to my position and, as a consequence, 2 million people may not be able to pay their bills and tens of millions of people who are struggling right now are suddenly going to see their paychecks smaller.\xc2\xa0 Or alternatively, what I can do is I can say that I am going to stick to my position that those folks get relief, that people get help for unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 And I will continue to fight before the American people to make the point that the Republican position is wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, if there was not collateral damage, if this was just a matter of my politics or being able to persuade the American people to my side, then I would just stick to my guns, because the fact of the matter is the American people already agree with me.\xc2\xa0 There are polls showing right now that the American people, for the most part, think it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad idea to provide tax cuts to the wealthy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the issue is not me persuading the American people; they\xe2\x80\x99re already there.\xc2\xa0 The issue is, how do I persuade the Republicans in the Senate who are currently blocking that position.\xc2\xa0 I have not been able to budge them.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any suggestion anybody in this room thinks realistically that we can budge them right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in the meantime, there are a whole bunch of people being hurt and the economy would be damaged.\xc2\xa0 And my first job is to make sure that the economy is growing, that we\xe2\x80\x99re creating jobs out there, and that people who are struggling are getting some relief.\xc2\xa0 And if I have to choose between having a protracted political battle on the one hand, but those folks being hurt or helping those folks and continuing to fight this political battle over the next two years, I will choose the latter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I may follow up quickly, sir, you\xe2\x80\x99re describing the situation you\xe2\x80\x99re in right now.\xc2\xa0 What about the last two years when it comes to your preferred option?\xc2\xa0 Was there a failure either on the part of the Democratic leadership on the Hill or here that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t preclude these wealthier cuts from going forward?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say that on the Republican side, this is their holy grail, these tax cuts for the wealthy.\xc2\xa0 This is -- seems to be their central economic doctrine.\xc2\xa0 And so, unless we had 60 votes in the Senate at any given time, it would be very hard for us to move this forward.\xc2\xa0 I have said that I would have liked to have seen a vote before the election.\xc2\xa0 I thought this was a strong position for us to take into the election, to crystallize the positions of the two parties, because I think the Democrats have better ideas.\xc2\xa0 I think our proposal to make sure that the middle class is held harmless, but that we don\xe2\x80\x99t make these Bush tax cuts permanent for wealthy individuals, because it was going to cost the country at a time when we\xe2\x80\x99ve got these looming deficits, that that was the better position to take.\xc2\xa0 And the American people were persuaded by that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t persuaded the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t persuaded Mitch McConnell and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t persuaded John Boehner.\xc2\xa0 And if I can\xe2\x80\x99t persuade them, then I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to look at what is the best thing to do, given that reality, for the American people and for jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Julianna.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 Back in July, your budget office\xe2\x80\x99s Mid-Session Review forecast that unemployment would be 7.7 percent in the second -- in the fourth quarter of 2012.\xc2\xa0 Will this package deal lower that projected rate?\xc2\xa0 And also, is it going to do more to boost growth and create jobs than your Recovery Act?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 This is not as significant a boost to the economy as the Recovery Act was, but we\xe2\x80\x99re in a different situation now.\xc2\xa0 I mean, when the Recovery Act passed, we were looking at a potential Great Depression and we might have seen unemployment go up to 15 percent, 20 percent -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 In combination with the work we did in stabilizing the financial system, the work that the Federal Reserve did, that\xe2\x80\x99s behind us now.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have the danger of a double-dip recession.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we have is a situation in which the economy, although growing, although company profits are up, although we are seeing some job growth in the private sector, the economy is not growing fast enough to drive down the unemployment rate given the 8 million jobs that were lost before I came into office and just as I was coming into office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what this package does is provide an additional boost that is substantially more significant than I think most economic forecasters had expected.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, you\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen some, just over the last 24 hours, suggest that we may see faster growth and more job growth as a consequence of this package.\xc2\xa0 I think the payroll tax holiday will have an impact.\xc2\xa0 Unemployment insurance probably has the biggest impact in terms of making sure that the recovery that we have continues and perhaps at a faster pace.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, overall, every economist I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to suggests that this will help economic growth and this will help job growth over the next several months.\xc2\xa0 And that is the main criteria by which I made this decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, this is something that I think everybody has to remember, and I would speak especially to my fellow Democrats who I think rightly are passionate about middle-class families, working families, low-income families who are having the toughest time in this economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The single most important jobs program we can put in place is a growing economy.\xc2\xa0 The single most important anti-poverty program we can put in place is making sure folks have jobs and the economy is growing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We can do a whole bunch of other stuff, but if the economy is not growing, if the private sector is not hiring faster than it\xe2\x80\x99s currently hiring, then we are going to continue to have problems no matter how many programs we put into place.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why, when I look at what our options were, for us to have another three, four, five months of uncertainty, not only would that have a direct impact on the people who see their paychecks get smaller, not only would that have a direct impact on people who are unemployed and literally depend on unemployment insurance to pay the bills or keep their home or keep their car, but in terms of macroeconomics, the overall health of the economy, that would have been a damaging thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up.\xc2\xa0 The unemployment rate was just north of 8 percent when the last Recovery Act was put in place.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s now 9.8 percent.\xc2\xa0 Are you prepared to say today that the unemployment rate is going to go down as a result of this package?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 My expectation is that the unemployment rate is going to be going down because the economy is growing.\xc2\xa0 And even though it\xe2\x80\x99s growing more slowly that I\xe2\x80\x99d like, it\xe2\x80\x99s still growing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, how fast it\xe2\x80\x99s going to go down, how quickly the economy is going to grow, when are private sector businesses going to start making the investments in plant and equipment and actually start hiring people again?\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of economists out there who have been struggling with that question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make a prediction.\xc2\xa0 What I can say with confidence is that this package will help strengthen the economy -- will help strengthen the recovery.\xc2\xa0 That I\xe2\x80\x99m confident about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chuck Todd.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, what do you say to Democrats who say you\xe2\x80\x99re rewarding Republican obstruction here?\xc2\xa0 You yourself used in your opening statement they were unwilling to budge on this.\xc2\xa0 A lot of progressive Democrats are saying they\xe2\x80\x99re unwilling to budge, and you\xe2\x80\x99re asking them to get off the fence and budge.\xc2\xa0 Why should they be rewarding Republican obstruction?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me use a couple of analogies.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before that I felt that the middle-class tax cuts were being held hostage to the high-end tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s tempting not to negotiate with hostage-takers, unless the hostage gets harmed.\xc2\xa0 Then people will question the wisdom of that strategy.\xc2\xa0 In this case, the hostage was the American people and I was not willing to see them get harmed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, this not an abstract political fight.\xc2\xa0 This is not isolated here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 There are people right now who, when their unemployment insurance runs out, will not be able to pay the bills.\xc2\xa0 There are folks right now who are just barely making it on the paycheck that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got, and when that paycheck gets smaller on January 1st, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to scramble to figure out, how am I going to pay all my bills?\xc2\xa0 How am I going to keep on making the payments for my child\xe2\x80\x99s college tuition?\xc2\xa0 What am I going to do exactly?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I could have enjoyed the battle with Republicans over the next month or two, because as I said, the American people are on our side.\xc2\xa0 This is not a situation in which I have failed to persuade the American people of the rightness of our position.\xc2\xa0 I know the polls.\xc2\xa0 The polls are on our side on this.\xc2\xa0 We weren\xe2\x80\x99t operating from a position of political weakness with respect to public opinion.\xc2\xa0 The problem is that Republicans feel that this is the single most important thing that they have to fight for as a party.\xc2\xa0 And in light of that, it was going to be a protracted battle and they would have a stronger position next year than they do currently.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess another way of thinking about it is that if -- certainly if we had made a determination that the deal was a permanent tax break for high-income individuals in exchange for these short-term things that people need right now, that would have been unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 And the reason is, is because you would be looking at $700 billion that would be added to the deficit with very little on the short term that would help to offset that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The deal that we\xe2\x80\x99ve struck here makes the high-end tax cuts temporary, and that gives us the time to have this political battle without having the same casualties for the American people that are my number one concern.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I may follow, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you telegraphing, though, a negotiating strategy of how the Republicans can beat you in negotiations all the way through the next year because they can just stick to their guns, stay united, be unwilling to budge -- to use your words -- and force you to capitulate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 And the reason is because this is a very unique circumstance.\xc2\xa0 This is a situation in which tens of millions of people would be directly damaged and immediately damaged, and at a time when the economy is just about to recover.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, keep in mind, I\xe2\x80\x99ve just gone through two years, Chuck, where the rap on me was I was too stubborn and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t willing to budge on a whole bunch of issues -- including, by the way, health care where everybody here was writing about how, despite public opinion and despite this and despite that, somehow the guy is going to bulldoze his way through this thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tell that to the left -- they weren\xe2\x80\x99t happy --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, but that\xe2\x80\x99s my point.\xc2\xa0 My point is I don\xe2\x80\x99t make judgments based on what the conventional wisdom is at any given time.\xc2\xa0 I make my judgments based on what I think is right for the country and for the American people right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I will be happy to see the Republicans test whether or not I\xe2\x80\x99m itching for a fight on a whole range of issues.\xc2\xa0 I suspect they will find I am.\xc2\xa0 And I think the American people will be on my side on a whole bunch of these fights.\xc2\xa0 But right now I want to make sure that the American people aren\xe2\x80\x99t hurt because we\xe2\x80\x99re having a political fight, and I think that this agreement accomplishes that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, as I said, there are a whole bunch of things that they are giving up.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the truth of the matter is, from the Republican perspective, the Earned Income Tax Credit, the college tuition tax credit, the Child Tax Credit -- all those things that are so important for so many families across the country -- those are things they really opposed.\xc2\xa0 And so temporarily, they are willing to go along with that, presumably because they think they can beat me on that over the course of the next two years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to have that battle.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to have that conversation.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure that the American people aren\xe2\x80\x99t harmed while we\xe2\x80\x99re having that broader argument.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scott Horsley.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 Last week members of your administration were boasting that your willingness to walk away from the Korean negotiations led to a better deal.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain how this is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 The difference is that if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the Korea deal done on January 1st the taxes of middle-class America wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go up.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty straightforward.\xc2\xa0 If we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the Korea deal done by January 1st, 2 million people weren\xe2\x80\x99t suddenly looking at having no way to support their families.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why -- this goes to Chuck\xe2\x80\x99s question as well about what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be different in the future. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a situation here that was urgent for millions of people.\xc2\xa0 But as I recall, with the Korea free trade agreement, that was deemed by conventional wisdom as an example of us not getting something done.\xc2\xa0 I remember a story above the fold on that.\xc2\xa0 Then when we got it done with a better deal that has the endorsement of not only the U.S. auto companies but also of labor, the story was sort of below the fold.\xc2\xa0 So I would just point that out.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I am happy to be tested over the next several months about our ability to negotiate with Republicans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Having bought that time now, do you hope to use this two-year window to push for a broader overhaul of the tax code?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And the answer is yes.\xc2\xa0 Part of what I want to do is to essentially get the American people in a safe place so that we can then get the economy in a stable place.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to have a broad-based discussion across the country about our priorities.\xc2\xa0 And I started doing that yesterday down in North Carolina.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the long-term issue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had two years of emergency -- emergency economic action on the banking industry, the auto industry, on unemployment insurance, on a whole range of issues -- on state budgets.\xc2\xa0 The situation has now stabilized, although for those folks who are out of work, it\xe2\x80\x99s still an emergency.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve still got to focus short term on job growth.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have a larger debate about how is this -- how is this country going to win the economic competition of the 21st century?\xc2\xa0 How are we going to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the best-trained workers in the world?\xc2\xa0 There was just a study that came out today showing how we\xe2\x80\x99ve slipped even further when it comes to math education and science education.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what are we doing to revamp our schools to make sure our kids can compete?\xc2\xa0 What are we doing in terms of research and development to make sure that innovation is still taking place here in the United States of America?\xc2\xa0 What are we doing about our infrastructure so that we have the best airports and the best roads and the best bridges?\xc2\xa0 And how are we going to pay for all that at a time when we\xe2\x80\x99ve got both short-term deficit problems, medium-term deficit problems, and long-term deficit problems?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a big debate.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s going to involve us sorting out what government functions are adding to our competitiveness and increasing opportunity and making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re growing the economy, and which aspects of the government aren\xe2\x80\x99t helping.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to figure out how do we pay for that.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to mean looking at the tax code and saying, what\xe2\x80\x99s fair, what\xe2\x80\x99s efficient.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody thinks the tax code right now is fair or efficient.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make sure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t just paper over those problems by borrowing from China or Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a major conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in that context, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how the Republicans win that argument.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to argue that extending permanently these high-end tax cuts is going to be good for our economy when, to offset them, we\xe2\x80\x99d end up having to cut vital services for our kids, for our veterans, for our seniors.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to listen to their arguments.\xc2\xa0 And I think the American people will benefit from that debate.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be starting next year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Marc Ambinder.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, thank you.\xc2\xa0 How do these negotiations affect negotiations or talks with Republicans about raising the debt limit?\xc2\xa0 Because it would seem that they have a significant amount of leverage over the White House now, going in.\xc2\xa0 Was there ever any attempt by the White House to include raising the debt limit as a part of this package?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 When you say it would seem they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a significant amount of leverage over the White House, what do you mean?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just in the sense that they\xe2\x80\x99ll say essentially we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to raise the -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to agree to it unless the White House is able to or willing to agree to significant spending cuts across the board that probably go deeper and further than what you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to do.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what leverage would you have --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Look, here\xe2\x80\x99s my expectation -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take John Boehner at his word -- that nobody, Democrat or Republican, is willing to see the full faith and credit of the United States government collapse, that that would not be a good thing to happen.\xc2\xa0 And so I think that there will be significant discussions about the debt limit vote.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that nobody ever likes to vote on.\xc2\xa0 But once John Boehner is sworn in as Speaker, then he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have responsibilities to govern.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t just stand on the sidelines and be a bomb thrower.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so my expectation is, is that we will have tough negotiations around the budget, but that ultimately we can arrive at a position that is keeping the government open, keeping Social Security checks going out, keeping veterans services being provided, but at the same time is prudent when it comes to taxpayer dollars.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan Weisman, last question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some on the left have questioned -- have looked at this deal and questioned what your core values are, what specifically you will go to the mat on.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can reassure them with some specific things in saying, all right, this is where I don\xe2\x80\x99t budge.\xc2\xa0 And along those lines, what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be different in 2012, when all these tax cuts again are up for expiration?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be different in 2012 we\xe2\x80\x99ve just discussed, which is we will have had two years to discuss the budget -- not in the abstract, but in concrete terms.\xc2\xa0 Over the last two years, the Republicans have had the benefit of watching us take all these emergency actions, having us preside over a $1.3 trillion deficit that we inherited and just pointing fingers and saying, that\xe2\x80\x99s their problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, over the next two years, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to show me what it is that they think they can do.\xc2\xa0 And I think it becomes pretty clear, after you go through the budget line by line, that if in fact they want to pay for $700 billion worth of tax breaks to wealthy individuals, that that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money and that the cuts -- corresponding cuts that would have to be made are very painful.\xc2\xa0 So either they rethink their position, or I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do very well in 2012.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s on the first point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With respect to the bottom line in terms of what my core principles are --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where is your line in the sand?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a whole bunch of lines in the sand.\xc2\xa0 Not making the tax cuts for the wealthy permanent -- that was a line in the sand.\xc2\xa0 Making sure that the things that most impact middle-class families and low-income families, that those were preserved -- that was a line in the sand.\xc2\xa0 I would not have agreed to a deal, which, by the way, some in Congress were talking about, of just a two-year extension on the Bush tax cuts and one year of unemployment insurance, but meanwhile all the other provisions, the Earned Income Tax Credit or other important breaks for middle-class families like the college tax credit, that those had gone away just because they had Obama\xe2\x80\x99s name attached to them instead of Bush\xe2\x80\x99s name attached to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this notion that somehow we are willing to compromise too much reminds me of the debate that we had during health care.\xc2\xa0 This is the public option debate all over again.\xc2\xa0 So I pass a signature piece of legislation where we finally get health care for all Americans, something that Democrats had been fighting for for a hundred years, but because there was a provision in there that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get that would have affected maybe a couple of million people, even though we got health insurance for 30 million people and the potential for lower\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 premiums for 100 million people, that somehow that was a sign of weakness and compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, if that\xe2\x80\x99s the standard by which we are measuring success or core principles, then let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, we will never get anything done.\xc2\xa0 People will have the satisfaction of having a purist position and no victories for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And we will be able to feel good about ourselves and sanctimonious about how pure our intentions are and how tough we are, and in the meantime, the American people are still seeing themselves not able to get health insurance because of preexisting conditions or not being able to pay their bills because their unemployment insurance ran out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That can\xe2\x80\x99t be the measure of how we think about our public service.\xc2\xa0 That can\xe2\x80\x99t be the measure of what it means to be a Democrat.\xc2\xa0 This is a big, diverse country.\xc2\xa0 Not everybody agrees with us.\xc2\xa0 I know that shocks people.\xc2\xa0 The New York Times editorial page does not permeate across all of America.\xc2\xa0 Neither does The Wall Street Journal editorial page.\xc2\xa0 Most Americans, they\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to figure out how to go about their lives and how can we make sure that our elected officials are looking out for us.\xc2\xa0 And that means because it\xe2\x80\x99s a big, diverse country and people have a lot of complicated positions, it means that in order to get stuff done, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to compromise.\xc2\xa0 This is why FDR, when he started Social Security, it only affected widows and orphans.\xc2\xa0 You did not qualify.\xc2\xa0 And yet now it is something that really helps a lot of people.\xc2\xa0 When Medicare was started, it was a small program.\xc2\xa0 It grew.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Under the criteria that you just set out, each of those were betrayals of some abstract ideal.\xc2\xa0 This country was founded on compromise.\xc2\xa0 I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go through the front door at this country\xe2\x80\x99s founding.\xc2\xa0 And if we were really thinking about ideal positions, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a union.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my job is to make sure that we have a North Star out there.\xc2\xa0 What is helping the American people live out their lives?\xc2\xa0 What is giving them more opportunity?\xc2\xa0 What is growing the economy?\xc2\xa0 What is making us more competitive?\xc2\xa0 And at any given juncture, there are going to be times where my preferred option, what I am absolutely positive is right, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so then my question is, does it make sense for me to tack a little bit this way or tack a little bit that way, because I\xe2\x80\x99m keeping my eye on the long term and the long fight -- not my day-to-day news cycle, but where am I going over the long term?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a single Democrat out there, who if they looked at where we started when I came into office and look at where we are now, would say that somehow we have not moved in the direction that I promised.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Take a tally.\xc2\xa0 Look at what I promised during the campaign.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a single thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that I would do that I have not either done or tried to do.\xc2\xa0 And if I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten it done yet, I\xe2\x80\x99m still trying to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so the -- to my Democratic friends, what I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest is, let\xe2\x80\x99s make sure that we understand this is a long game.\xc2\xa0 This is not a short game.\xc2\xa0 And to my Republican friends, I would suggest -- I think this is a good agreement, because I know that they\xe2\x80\x99re swallowing some things that they don\xe2\x80\x99t like as well, and I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to seeing them on the field of competition over the next two years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
