HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 We had a little change in the programming note, but we do have Bruce Riedel and Michelle Flournoy, who both were very much a part of this whole review.\xc2\xa0 Bruce will start off with a few remarks, and then we\'ll open it to Q&amp;A.\xc2\xa0 This is on the record.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much, Mike.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tYou\'ve heard what the President had to say, so I\'m not going to go into repeating his remarks.\xc2\xa0 Let me just open with a few process questions in order to put this in perspective, and then I might hit on a couple of highlights, and then as quickly as possible we want to get to your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThis review builds on three previous reviews -- one done by General Lute at the National Security Council, one done by Admiral Mullen at the Joint Staff, and a third by General Petraeus at CENTCOM.\xc2\xa0 We took all of the results of those reviews into consideration right from the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWe also did a lot of reaching out to experts outside of the U.S. government in think tanks across America and in South Asia, as well.\xc2\xa0 We consulted very extensively on the Hill right from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had intense series of meetings here at the White House with Speaker Pelosi and others in order to hear what they had to say and to get their input into this process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tIt has been thoroughly vetted through the interagency process at all levels, including the deputies committee and the principals committee of the National Security Council.\xc2\xa0 And of course, we\'ve reached out to our commanders in the field including General Petraeus, and our diplomats in the field including Ambassador Patterson.\xc2\xa0 Not the least -- and I really want to emphasis -- we\'ve been engaged in extensive consultations with our allies, starting, first and foremost, with our partners, Afghanistan and Pakistan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tIn February we hosted delegations from both countries here at the White House for very intense conversations about the problems they face and to hear what was on their minds.\xc2\xa0 And then Secretary Clinton hosted a trilateral meeting at the State Department in order to bring us all together.\xc2\xa0 And as you notice from the President\'s speech, this trilateral diplomacy will be an ongoing feature of this policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOf course, we\'ve also reached out to our NATO partners and to our non-NATO partners who have troops on the ground in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President made two trips to Europe specifically to reach out to NATO and the other partners in Brussels in order to get their views.\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Holbrooke briefed the North Atlantic Council last week on where we were in this process, and the President this week met with NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThis has been a very intense and ambitious and aggressive 60-day effort to reach out and to make sure that we\'ve gotten everyone\'s views into it.\xc2\xa0 Next week, of course, the President will discuss this at the NATO summit in Strasbourg and also at the EU summit in Prague.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI\'ll just put one or two of the key headlines, I think, on the table here.\xc2\xa0 I think, as you heard, the President wants to make sure that this mission has a focus and a clear, concise goal.\xc2\xa0 And that goal, as he spelled it out, is to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda, and to ensure that their safe havens in Afghanistan and Pakistan cannot threaten the United States anymore.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAs he put it, al Qaeda has succeeded in regenerating itself over the last seven years, and it is again a threat to the United States homeland and to American influence around the world and to our allies around the world.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAl Qaeda operates within a very sophisticated syndicate of terrorist organizations in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 I\'d be happy to try to explain that more to you in questions and answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThus far, our policy sees Afghanistan and Pakistan as two countries, but one theater of operations for our diplomacy, and one challenge for our overall policy.\xc2\xa0 As the President laid out, we\'re going to engage intensively with the Pakistani government.\xc2\xa0 We have very concrete proposals for increasing economic assistance to Pakistan, proposals that have already been put forward by the Congress.\xc2\xa0 We\'re also looking at what we can do on the military side.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOn the Afghanistan side, the President has resourced fully the requirements of the mission -- not just on the military side, but I want to emphasize on the civilian side, as well.\xc2\xa0 Now, for the first time, we are providing the kind of civilian support that this mission has always needed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tLastly, we\'re going to engage in very intensive regional diplomacy with all the key stakeholders in the region in order to make sure we do everything we can to enhance security and stability in the broader region and isolate al Qaeda and the militants as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tYou\'ve heard the President, you\'ve had the chance to speak to many of us on other occasions, so I think at this point the most useful thing to do is open it up to your questions, and we\'ll be happy to respond.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSir, you were first.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we see this as an abandonment or shift from the counterinsurgency mission that had been undertaken in Iraq and to a lesser degree in Afghanistan, shifting from that to a much more narrowly focused counterterror mission?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll let Michelle talk a little bit more about counterinsurgency, but I think there is nothing minimalist about this approach.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMS. FLOURNOY:\xc2\xa0 If anything, I would say what we\'re doing is stepping up to more fully resource a counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan that is designed to first reverse Taliban gains and secure the population, particularly in the most contested areas of the south and east; second, provide the Afghan national security forces with the training and the mentoring they need to expand rapidly and to take -- ultimately take the lead in providing security for their nation; and finally, to provide a secure environment that will enable governance and development efforts to take root and grow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSo this is a -- it has as its goal disrupting and defeating al Qaeda and its associates, and preventing Afghanistan and Pakistan -- preventing Afghanistan from returning to become a safe haven.\xc2\xa0 But it is very much a counterinsurgency approach towards that end.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that, just to clarify?\xc2\xa0 Is there an increase in the U.S. military or intelligence community conducting counterterrorism operations, going after high-value targets like al Qaeda or their sympathizers in Afghanistan or in Pakistan?\xc2\xa0 Is that a part of this strategy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMS. FLOURNOY:\xc2\xa0 The counterterrorism piece remains a central part of this mission, and I certainly believe we are going to be increasing our intelligence focus in this theater, and as opportunities arise that may increase the pace of operations, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything specific about going after bin Laden?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that we\'re going to get into specifics about intelligence operations here.\xc2\xa0 I think the President said very clearly during the campaign, and you heard him say it again today, that if we have actionable intelligence about senior targets, we will take the appropriate action.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about how you envision reducing the safe havens in Pakistan?\xc2\xa0 You talked a little bit about the broad strategy versus Pakistan, but I don\'t understand how that will shrink or reduce the safe havens over time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 I think this -- the short answer to that is that the combination of military operations, aggressive military operations on the Afghan side, and working energetically with the Pakistani government to shut down these safe havens, creates the synergy which we hope will then lead to their destruction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President gave his first press conference about a month back, he said that the central government of Afghanistan was detached from the rest of the country.\xc2\xa0 What is envisioned -- what is within your ability to do about undetaching it, because if it remains detached, how can you implement these programs, and how can you do anything about the corruption, which the President spoke about a little bit but didn\'t really detail how you address it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 I want to bring Richard into this part of the conversation, because he\'s had the distinction of having more opportunity to deal with them than Michelle and I have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I thought this was Bruce\'s press conference.\xc2\xa0 Sorry I\'m late.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Can you just -- I know, I really apologize for being late.\xc2\xa0 Could you just repeat the question in a -- this is something to do with corruption, which, by the way, I\'m totally against.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But could you just clarify what the question was?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the President himself said that the central government in Afghanistan was detached from the rest of the country.\xc2\xa0 So I want to know what in this new strategic review will address that issue.\xc2\xa0 What is within the power of the United States and NATO to make the government less detached, and how does that play into the whole issue of corruption, which the President talked about briefly today but didn\'t give any details on how you actually deal with corruption?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 First, let me just say that President Karzai has called and is trying to reach me now, and I may have to leave, take the call.\xc2\xa0 But he sent in word already that he watched the speech live on CNN from Kabul, that he was extremely gratified by it, and that he will be issuing his own statement of support in -- quickly, but that may divert me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI would just point you to the fact that no American chief executive has spoken about corruption this way ever before in open.\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that a fair statement, Bruce?\xc2\xa0 And on the way out, a former Assistant Secretary of State, who many of you know, but I better not give his name, since he isn\'t -- I was going to say it -- with vast experience --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he a big guy?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 They\'re all big guys.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 He said -- he said to me, I\'ve been waiting six years to hear a speech like that, and the emphasis on corruption is essential.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve all been reporting it for years.\xc2\xa0 We view it as a cancer eating away at the country and it has to be dealt with.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we\'re not going to lay out how we\'re going to deal with it.\xc2\xa0 To some extent, we don\'t know yet.\xc2\xa0 There\'s so much dispute about it.\xc2\xa0 Senators have talked about it, including senators who are now President, Vice President and Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 And they bring what they said as senators to this issue.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnd speaking for myself, I\'ve written about it a lot.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t take back anything I ever wrote as a private citizen.\xc2\xa0 Now we\'ve been offered the extraordinary challenge of trying to deal with this problem.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re here to say, it is at the highest levels.\xc2\xa0 Why?\xc2\xa0 This isn\'t baksheesh.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got to make a distinction between ordinary problems that happen in every society.\xc2\xa0 This is massive efforts that undermine the government.\xc2\xa0 President Karzai himself has said this, and we need to work on this.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a huge recruiting draw -- excuse me, huge recruiting opportunity for the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 It\'s one of their major things they exploit.\xc2\xa0 But I can\'t lay out to you how exactly we\'re going to do this.\xc2\xa0 We\'re just starting out.\xc2\xa0 And by the way, we\'re in the middle of an election campaign in Afghanistan, which complicates everything enormously.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you -- three precise questions -- do you fully support President Karzai and his family?\xc2\xa0 How are you going to get the confidence of the local population?\xc2\xa0 And is there an exit strategy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 The only exit strategy that Bruce and Michelle and I and the people we work for and with can see is pretty basic.\xc2\xa0 We can leave as the Afghans can deal with their own security problems.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President today put emphasis on training the National Army, training and improving the National Police.\xc2\xa0 And he said -- and I would draw your attention to this -- that there will be an increase in their numbers, although he did not give a precise figure.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen some in articles, particularly one in The New York Times the other day -- those figures were figures kicking around in the planning process, but they weren\'t sufficiently scrubbed down; they weren\'t sufficiently costed out.\xc2\xa0 So the President felt that he ought to just talk about the increase now and we\'re going to keep working on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tIt\'s a -- that is -- the exit strategy of course includes governance, corruption, but above all -- and this is the single most difficult aspect of what we\'re talking about today -- above all, it also requires dealing with western Pakistan, because you could have a great government in Kabul; you could have a government that fulfills every criteria of democratic governance, and if the current situation in western Pakistan continued, the instability in Afghanistan would continue.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tYou all know that, those of you who\'ve been there.\xc2\xa0 It is clearly reflected in Margaret Warner\'s series from Afghanistan and Pakistan on Lehrer NewsHour recently.\xc2\xa0 It\'s been reported in every one of your newspapers.\xc2\xa0 CNN has done it.\xc2\xa0 We have to deal with this western Pakistan problem.\xc2\xa0 And I think Bruce and Michelle and I and our superiors would all freely admit that that is, of all the dilemmas, problems and challenges we face, that\'s going to be the most daunting, because it\'s a sovereign country and there is a red line.\xc2\xa0 And the red line is unambiguous and stated publically by the Pakistani government over and over again:\xc2\xa0 No foreign troops on our soil.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you support Karzai.\xc2\xa0 Do you support President Karzai and his brother?\xc2\xa0 Do you fully support them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 We support the elected leadership of Afghanistan and we support the elected leadership of Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 In the elections process, this is a decision for the Afghan and Pakistani people; it is not an American decision, and the United States is not endorsing candidates.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 Let me phrase it even more precisely, because we have a mantra we\'re going to work out on this, and it\'s very clear.\xc2\xa0 As I\'m sure most of you know, the Constitution says under Article 61 that President Karzai -- not President Karzai -- but the President\'s term ends on May 22nd.\xc2\xa0 The election commission decide -- which meant the election should be held on April 21st.\xc2\xa0 The election commission in Afghanistan said they wanted to postpone the election to August 20th for various reasons.\xc2\xa0 There may be a runoff that would take it to October 2nd.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThe United States, in that interim -- there\'s going to be a big argument about who\'s President from May 22nd to August 20th.\xc2\xa0 The United States\' position could not be clearer, and President Obama has personally reviewed it and articulated it, and it\'s worth repeating again today:\xc2\xa0 We believe there should be continuity of government until the election -- point number one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tPoint number two:\xc2\xa0 The United States will neither support nor oppose any candidate in these elections.\xc2\xa0 In the meetings yesterday that the President had with the leadership, which we were privileged to be in, he was explicit on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnd point number three:\xc2\xa0 We believe the election should be free, fair, open, and the candidates should operate from a level playing field.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve reviewed this with President Karzai, we\'ve reviewed it with the other candidates, and that\'s really all we\'re going to say on that subject.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMS. FLOURNOY:\xc2\xa0 If I could just clarify one point on the topic of exit strategy, even as we ultimately consider transition of responsibilities in the security sector, one of the things that\'s very clear in this strategy is a long-term commitment to assisting the Afghan people, in terms of economic and security assistance long-term, even as the security sector may transition over time.\xc2\xa0 So I wanted to clarify that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThe other thing that, with regard to your question about connecting to the people, is I think there is a shift in strategy towards emphasizing more bottom-up approaches in development and governance at the district and provincial level to complement the investments we\'re making at the national level in ministries and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 And in that regard, that\'s one of the most important things the President mentioned, but which could get otherwise missed:\xc2\xa0 agricultural-sector job creation.\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking to Secretary Vilsack about that; the U.S. Department of Agriculture is going to get much more involved.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThis is a rural country.\xc2\xa0 There is no agricultural -- senior agricultural attach\xc3\xa9 in the mission right now.\xc2\xa0 AID and USDA don\'t work together.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to fix all that, I hope.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to go to -- we\'re going to emphasize wheat; it\'s a wheat culture, and the current wheat is very low in nutrients.\xc2\xa0 President Obama is personally enthusiastic and interested in this.\xc2\xa0 Tom Vilsack will be part of our next trilateral meeting; he wasn\'t part of the first one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSo that\'s what Michelle means by ground-up.\xc2\xa0 We also want to work on training district-level officials in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 There are 396 districts in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 There\'s been no training at that level.\xc2\xa0 There are lots of things like that we can do.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not nation building; it\'s what you do to help a country that is in need.\xc2\xa0 They have a nation; we need to help them stand on their own feet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s happening in terms of an increase in troops among our allies?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMS. FLOURNOY:\xc2\xa0 This is -- we are -- the President is going to the NATO summit; Secretary Clinton is going to The Hague on March 31st.\xc2\xa0 We are -- have been engaging extensively throughout the review with our allies and our partners and we have made some very clear requests of them, not only in the military sphere, but in the training and mentoring sphere, in the capacity sphere on the civilian side, in terms of -- also in terms of financial contributions.\xc2\xa0 So we are making very specific asks; we\'ve been in consultation with them already and we expect many of those to be -- come to fruition over the next month or two.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 But The Hague is not a pledging conference.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to The Hague to collect numbers; we\'re going to The Hague to set the framework for a new revitalization of the commitment.\xc2\xa0 However, many countries have already talked to us privately about either troops during the election period, or nonmilitary support.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tI would particularly draw your attention to Japan.\xc2\xa0 Japan is going to pay the salaries of the National Police for the next six months -- all of it -- as an example of huge -- and this is very important; the Congress emphasizes it all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you go through the benchmarks, please?\xc2\xa0 What are they?\xc2\xa0 Who set them and who will determine whether the benchmarks are being met?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 The benchmarks is a process that\'s just beginning.\xc2\xa0 We have not established them.\xc2\xa0 Let me say that this strategic review is a road map for moving forward; it\'s a strategy.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not intended to be a campaign plan or a straitjacket.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWe will develop benchmarks across the board.\xc2\xa0 Some of these are fairly obvious, like levels of violence, levels of casualties, periodicity of suicide bombings both in Afghanistan and Pakistan -- those kind of benchmarks that you measure any conflict by.\xc2\xa0 Those are some that are pretty obvious.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be other ones about moving against corruption; there will be other ones about the speed with which we build up the Afghan army and the success rate of building the Afghan army.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSo the benchmarks process is not something that\'s locked in stone today.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something that we\'re only at the beginning phase of starting to work on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, will the benchmarks be just for Afghanistan, or will they also be for any kind of progress being made in western Pakistan?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 The President feels very strongly that this strategy needs to be flexible and adaptable, and that to the extent possible, we develop metrics -- and you heard him use that word in the speech -- that give you an idea of our success rate. He wants to reevaluate periodically how we\'re doing, what\'s working, what\'s not working, make mid-course corrections and adjustments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThis is a very, very difficult problem, as the President laid out.\xc2\xa0 It\'s going to be a long and difficult road ahead.\xc2\xa0 And he wants to have, and we have built into the strategy, maximum flexibility and adaptability.\xc2\xa0 For example, there may be a benchmark that we don\'t even know of now that, as we go forward, we begin to realize is something we want to test and measure.\xc2\xa0 So the theme of this process is to be flexible, adaptable and comprehensive, and self-regulating with periodic reviews.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about the question of corruption with regard to Pakistan?\xc2\xa0 The President alluded today to some problems in getting Pakistanis to respond when we have high-level intelligence -- or have intelligence about high-level terrorists, and he said, "We will insist that action be taken."\xc2\xa0 Does that mean if the Pakistanis will act we will not, and if they do not, we will?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t think we can answer that question.\xc2\xa0 It\'s speculative, it\'s hypothetical, and it would be deeply injurious to our national interest to speculate.\xc2\xa0 But I appreciate the importance of the question, and that\'s all we\'re ready to say.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say something about what the President meant by that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Taliban has come out with a statement in response to the President this morning.\xc2\xa0 They basically said that the U.S. is repeating the mistakes of the Russians, and if winning the war by military power worked then the Russians would still be in charge.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you have any comment to that.\xc2\xa0 And if that\'s the kind of rhetoric that they\'re -- they sound like they\'re ready to fight.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. ready for casualties, more Afghan casualties?\xc2\xa0 And how can the U.S. engage with them in any productive way?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 Let me comment on the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 It\'s no surprise.\xc2\xa0 We know that the core Taliban leadership, led by Mullah Omar, is determined not to negotiate with anybody.\xc2\xa0 They want to take Afghanistan back to the medieval hell that they created in the 1990s.\xc2\xa0 But there are many of the -- those involved in the insurgency who may not be so committed as that, and if we see the momentum of the Taliban broken this summer and over the course of the fighting season, we may see some fractures within that movement.\xc2\xa0 And I suspect that the core Taliban leadership is very, very worried about just that kind of thing happening.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMS. FLOURNOY:\xc2\xa0 And I would just further add that there\'s absolutely no valid comparison between the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which was an occupation to control a country, repress a population, install their own sort of puppet leadership.\xc2\xa0 We are there to, first and foremost, combat terrorism and protect our own interests and our own people from attack.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re also there to help the Afghan people and enable them to reclaim their country.\xc2\xa0 There is absolutely no comparison that\'s valid between the two.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to just check a few things.\xc2\xa0 How do you plan to deal with the danger to -- you\'re talking about significantly increasing aid to Pakistan, for example, on the civilian side.\xc2\xa0 How do you plan to deal -- get that aid into the tribal areas when even Embassy workers in Peshawar had to retreat?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how are you going to deal with that problem?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnd is there any risk of ending up -- and maybe this is for Michelle Flournoy -- ending up with an Afghan army that is too large to actually support financially in the long term?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnd the other question is, do you have any plans for how to improve coordination between all of the foreign interests that are involved in Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0 Is there some central way that you\'re going to be able to coordinate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMS. FLOURNOY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just take the Afghan national security forces question first.\xc2\xa0 We have identified this as a key priority -- building their capacity is a key priority in the new strategy -- and we\'re going to fully resource that effort for the first time in years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWe are going to -- right now the first step is to focus on accelerating that growth while maintaining quality to the established targets for both the army and the police by 2011.\xc2\xa0 At that point we\'ll need to assess whether that growth is adequate or whether they need to be expanded further, and that determination will be made down the road.\xc2\xa0 Part of that determination will be the question of sustainability, and that will obviously depend on the state of the Afghan economy, the willingness of the international community to continue to support and so forth.\xc2\xa0 So that is a question to be determined in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 The last part of your question was on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Coordination.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 Yes, between the civilians and the military in the U.S. side.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Among all of the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 Oh, the international.\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\'s a very interesting question.\xc2\xa0 Since the job I was given includes that issue -- I\'m actually interviewing now for somebody to do that on a full-time basis, that particular issue.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWe\'ve already begun extensive discussions with many other nations on how to refocus international assistance in a way that is more coordinated and more rational.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tIf a country has a geographic location for its troops -- the Dutch and Australians in Uruzgan, the Germans in Mazar-e-Sharif, the Italians in Herat -- wouldn\'t it make more sense for their aid to be focused in that area, too?\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to concentrate on the south and east.\xc2\xa0 We are also going to focus much, not all of our aid in that area.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnd so we\'re -- we need somebody working only on that issue, just on that issue, because it\'s so important.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve all reported on the lack of coordination among the international -- now, the U.N. has a central role in all this and will be very -- the U.N. is hosting the conference in The Hague that Michelle mentioned earlier, and that needs to be underscored.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary General of the U.N., Ban Ki-moon, will open it; Kai Eide will preside.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSo I\'m glad you raised that issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 With all of the consultations you did, there must have been some very attractive ideas that just didn\'t fit in the strategy today.\xc2\xa0 So are there things that you have in your notebook to look at in coming months that you may adopt?\xc2\xa0 And if so, what are they?\xc2\xa0 And more broadly speaking, on the continuum from doing nothing to trying to create a Central Asian Valhalla, where does this strategy fit:\xc2\xa0 maximum, minimal, or just right in the middle?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 I have never understood what the Valhalla thing was about, so I\'m going to stay away from that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 Which province is that in?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 I would say that this strategy is focused on a concise goal, and I think the President made that very clear.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s a goal that is about protecting American citizens and American interests.\xc2\xa0 From that there are a series of objectives.\xc2\xa0 But from the beginning of this process and in every conversation I had with the President about this, he kept coming back to, let\'s keep the focus clear on what the goal is.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAs for what\'s in my notebooks and Michelle\'s notebooks and Richard\'s notebooks, I\'m sure there are lots of good ideas in there and we\'re going to come back to this.\xc2\xa0 As I said at the beginning, this is a road map.\xc2\xa0 It will now be followed up by days, weeks, months of detailed implementation plans as we try to put this together in a way that can be executed and bring success.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 May I just expand on that for those of you who are interested in process.\xc2\xa0 I know Washington loves to talk about process.\xc2\xa0 We began with a very wide range of ideas.\xc2\xa0 One of the goals of this project was to form a common consensus, a base, for people who have to implement policy.\xc2\xa0 So you\'re quite right that there were hundreds of ideas thrown out.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThe emphasis in agriculture emerged from our dialogue.\xc2\xa0 The realization that the drug and narcotic program was not working, which was not the view we inherited, emerged from study involving a lot of agencies, and by the way is not universally agreed to.\xc2\xa0 You\'ll be able to find plenty of people in the government who don\'t agree with what Bruce and Michelle and I have said about drugs.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s the direction that we took it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tOf course there are ideas we didn\'t use.\xc2\xa0 Some of them were just -- by the way, we\'ve got thousands of ideas from citizens all over the country, and many other governments made inputs -- Pakistan and Afghanistan, first of all; all our NATO allies; Australia; Japan.\xc2\xa0 They all came to Washington and we talked to them.\xc2\xa0 We have -- we have mounds of paper.\xc2\xa0 And out of this, there was a consensus.\xc2\xa0 Here was the dilemma:\xc2\xa0 How do we avoid the consensus becoming watered-down conventional wisdom, which in my experience in this city is what usually happens.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThe way I think we\'ve avoided it is that this is a not a straitjacket, a detailed blueprint.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a framework within which there\'s plenty of flexibility to bring in ideas which are not in the report.\xc2\xa0 One of the most important ideas in this report -- which is new for this country but has been done in many other wars, including Iraq -- is the information issue.\xc2\xa0 We can -- in Swat, for example, there are about 150 illegal FM radio stations, and Fazlullah is going around every night broadcasting the names of people they\'re going to behead or they\'ve beheaded.\xc2\xa0 Any of you who have a sense of recent history know that that\'s exactly what happened with Radio Mille Collines in Rwanda, and the United States did nothing, to our eternal regret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnd nothing has been done so far about that.\xc2\xa0 These are unimpeded.\xc2\xa0 We have identified the information issue -- sometimes called psychological operations or strategic communication; used to have different names in the old days -- as a major, major gap to be filled.\xc2\xa0 Senator Kerry is pushing this very hard from the Senate side.\xc2\xa0 So this is the kind of thing that emerged from our discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 When you talk about comprehensive strategy and consulting with allies in the region and elsewhere, does this include the Saudis?\xc2\xa0 Because there was talk about they might play a mediation between the so-called moderate Taliban.\xc2\xa0 And if you have been in consultation with them, and whether it\'s going to be effective actually, talking to them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 We identify seven or eight countries that have critical importance beyond our NATO allies and Australia, Japan.\xc2\xa0 And Saudi Arabia is definitely one of them.\xc2\xa0 So is Turkey and the countries the President mentioned -- China, Russia, Iran, the neighbors, obviously Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 And I would add the United Arab Emirates.\xc2\xa0 These are countries that have real influence in either Pakistan or Afghanistan or both, all of whom are involved whether we like it or not, and we\'re going to spend a great deal of time on this.\xc2\xa0 And I mentioned earlier that I was looking for somebody to coordinate international foreign assistance.\xc2\xa0 I\'m also looking for somebody to focus on that issue on our small -- our small interagency staff that we have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know there\'s no fixed timeline for what you\'re working on, but there have been some time periods mentioned.\xc2\xa0 The President mentioned building up the troops by 2011.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned making inroads with the Taliban this summer.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tCan you give any time sense about how long it will take before you know this is working or not working?\xc2\xa0 Or how long -- what the time horizon is?\xc2\xa0 Are we talking about two years?\xc2\xa0 Five years?\xc2\xa0 Ten years?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 We very deliberately do not have timelines in this study.\xc2\xa0 And it goes back to what I said about the President\'s determination that we check the metrics, we see how we\'re doing, and we remain flexible and adaptable throughout the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWe\'re not going to impose artificial constraints.\xc2\xa0 The 2011 timeline is about building up the Afghan National Army.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a notional idea that by 2011 we\'ll be at the 134,000 -<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMS. FLOURNOY:\xc2\xa0 Army.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAMBASSADOR HOLBROOKE:\xc2\xa0 And 82,000.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just building on from that, General McKiernan has avoided using the term "search" for the extra troops that he\'s asked for.\xc2\xa0 And he\'s made the point that he thinks that the extra troops that are going in will need to be replaced.\xc2\xa0 In other words, this is a longer-term commitment than just one-off deployments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tDo you agree with that?\xc2\xa0 And will the troops, the combat troops at least, operate any differently in the field under this new strategy than they have been doing up until now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMS. FLOURNOY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think what Bruce -- I want to underscore the importance of what Bruce said.\xc2\xa0 We have committed to a regular process of reassessment and evaluation of this mission.\xc2\xa0 And I can assure you that the question of troop levels and duration of how many -- and rotations, and so forth -- will continue to be addressed over time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tWhat we don\'t want to do is pretend that we can predict where we\'ll be in a year, or what have you.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you there\'s a very strong commitment at the highest levels to that process of evaluation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnd in terms of what -- the missions of the troops on the ground, I think that American forces and our allied forces are going in with a couple of key missions in mind.\xc2\xa0 First is protecting the population, reversing Taliban gains, creating secure environments that will allow other things to happen in the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tBut equally important is we are going to be focused on the training mission and the mentoring mission, and the building of Afghan national security force capacity, both by embedding training teams with Afghan units, but also by partnering coalition units and Afghan units.\xc2\xa0 So they work together day in, day out, every day.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThat -- from one of our lessons learned from Iraq, is how powerful that partnering can be as a supplement to the embedded trainers.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The President mentioned the Kerry-Lugar bill, billions of dollars\' worth of aid to Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 He also said that Pakistan won\'t be given a blank check.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering what restrictions does the administration want to see on that money specifically?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAnd also, how do you react to statements from some senators, such as Senator Levin, who have said that this strategy places too much dependence on the Pakistani government to deal with extremists, and perhaps gives too much of a reliance on them to help us make progress in Afghanistan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to comment on Senator Levin\'s remarks.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll say this:\xc2\xa0 For the last eight years, Pakistan received billions of dollars in support from the United States -- much of it was unaccountable; much the Pakistanis don\'t even know where it went.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tAs the President indicated in his speech, we\'re going to make sure that there is rigorous oversight by an Inspector General\'s office.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to work very, very intensively with our Pakistani partners, the democratically elected civilian leadership in Pakistan, to see that we\'re moving in the right direction, in the same direction that we want to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThe United States has a long history of legislative-required sanctions on Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the things that we have learned from that history is that we need to be very careful in how we do this, and that we need to work with the Pakistanis and not box ourselves in or box them in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSo it\'s going to be a complex process.\xc2\xa0 We will work very closely with the Hill on the legislation.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re going to try on this area, as in every other area, to maintain the adaptability of our strategy, so that we can avoid finding ourselves boxed into a corner.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quick follow-up?\xc2\xa0 Very quick follow-up?\xc2\xa0 Is the ISI aiding the Taliban?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. RIEDEL:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the intelligence questions which have been in every newspaper in the United States in the last several days.\xc2\xa0 This strategy is built upon a very clear understanding of what\'s going on the region, but I\'m not going to comment on intelligence matters today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThank you very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tEND<br/>\n\t\t11:50 A.M.
