Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t12:58 P.M. EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Happy Monday. \xc2\xa0Let me do one statement at the top and then, Kevin, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFor the last few months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about the Zika virus and highlighting the concern that this administration has about the potential for spread of that disease in the United States. \xc2\xa0Today, Dr. Tom Frieden, who is the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, will be in Puerto Rico as part of a three-day visit to assess firsthand CDC support for the Zika response on the island. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhile we have not yet seen transmission of Zika by mosquito within the continental United States, spread of the virus in Puerto Rico has been a cause for concern. \xc2\xa0As of March 4th, the end of last week, 160 cases of Zika virus infection in Puerto Rico have been reported to the CDC, and based on the previous history of diseases spread by the same type of mosquito, thousands of Puerto Ricans could become infected this year alone.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDr. Frieden\xe2\x80\x99s trip will emphasize the need for preparedness and prevention to reduce the public health impact of the Zika outbreak in Puerto Rico with a focus on reducing the Zika virus to pregnant women, who, as we have said, are the most at-risk population. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that our concern with the Zika virus is that it is apparently linked to a particular birth defect. \xc2\xa0That link is currently under scientific review to determine exactly what the linkage is and how powerful it is. \xc2\xa0And for most of the population, this virus is not a threat -- about one in five people who contract the Zika virus will not even -- about only one in five people who contract the Zika virus will have symptoms; most people won\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0But our concern is about pregnant women contracting the virus and potentially having some pregnancy complications as a result. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMindful of this risk, this administration about a month ago laid out a package of legislative proposals -- essentially funding requests -- that would be helpful in fighting the disease here in the United States. \xc2\xa0We put forward specific language and specific line items to Congress two weeks ago now, and unfortunately we have seen very little in the way of congressional action on this. \xc2\xa0The only response, really, has been to suggest that the administration take money from other accounts to supplement this effort. \xc2\xa0The suggestion by some has even been made that the government should take away money that currently is being used to protect the American people from Ebola to fight Zika.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, we have allowed that there may be some ways where there are some funds that are available that could be moved to address Zika that would not undermine the fight against Ebola, because that obviously continues to be a priority. \xc2\xa0But that is not a sufficient response to this significant challenge, that if we want to continue to do work related to vaccines, if we wanted to continue to do work to develop diagnostics, there are also other public health steps that we can take -- essentially rapid-response teams that could respond to reports of someone contracting the disease. \xc2\xa0There also are significant efforts related to vector control. \xc2\xa0This is essentially trying to target the population of mosquitoes that we know transmits the virus.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there is a significant need here, and we need Congress to act. \xc2\xa0And unfortunately, the reception on Capitol Hill has been consistent with the kind of response that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Republicans on a range of other -- from Republicans in Congress on a range of other priorities, including the budget. \xc2\xa0And that essentially is not registering some concerns -- not after effectively engaging with the administration to find a solution. Rather, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Republicans, many of them, either ignore the request or to declare it dead on arrival without even considering it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat is not consistent with a government -- a majority party that has embraced their responsibility to govern. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the country, and it certainly explains a good portion of the rather low regard that the American public has for the current United States Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo when it comes to something as significant and important to our public health and our national security as Zika, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let it get broken down along party lines. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Congress act in genuine bipartisan fashion to do the right thing for the country, and they should be able to do this without allowing more narrow political considerations to interfere.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that, Kevin, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, before you go, remind us how much the administration is seeking.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The request is for about $1.9 billion. \xc2\xa0And we put out a factsheet sort of itemizing where those resources would be dedicated. \xc2\xa0And again, these are things like vector control, public health resources that would allow us to quickly respond to reports of an outbreak. \xc2\xa0There also is more research that can be done around vaccines, as well as development of diagnostic tools that would allow people to quickly understand whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99ve contracted the virus so that they can take the necessary steps to protect themselves and their families.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we can get you that factsheet that has more details about how exactly that money would be used.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just one quick question along those lines. \xc2\xa0Since Ebola is no longer the public health threat that it was, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with taking some of the money that you had dedicated toward it, taking it -- direct it toward confronting the Zika virus? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think there are a couple of things. \xc2\xa0The first is, there -- what our public health experts tell us is that we need to make sure that we follow through in combatting that disease. \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re right, the threat is not nearly as urgent from Ebola as it was back in 2014. \xc2\xa0I think the point that this administration has made is we need to prepare responsibly for these kinds of outbreaks; that that\xe2\x80\x99s critical to our national security, and waiting until there is widespread transmission of the disease, or a genuine threat of a pandemic is too late.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we know that there is more that we need to do to build up the public health infrastructure in some other countries to make sure that they can try to prevent the spread of the disease, which makes it harder and less likely to make its way to our shores. \xc2\xa0We know now -- this is part of our experience from Ebola -- for a while, it was a little hard to make a public case to all of you and to the American people that somehow, investing in the public health infrastructure of another country benefitted from -- the American people. \xc2\xa0But our experience with Ebola brought that issue to the fore, and in a way that I think is instructive for us to understand why confronting public health risks before they arrive in the United States is critical to our national security. \xc2\xa0I think everybody has learned that lesson, unfortunately, except for Congress, who is suggesting that we should take away resources from that effort in a way that could undermine our ability to finish the job.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo as I said, there may be certain areas where we can take money from these Ebola accounts without undermining our ability to finish the job there. \xc2\xa0But to suggest that we can fight the Zika virus just by taking all the money that we use to fight Ebola, that would be both unwise in terms of finishing the fight against Ebola, but also would under-resource the significant effort that we have in mind to try to protect the American people from Zika. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So what are the plans of the White House when it comes to who will attend Nancy Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s funeral?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that the -- well, let me start by saying that you saw the written comments from the President and First Lady that we issued yesterday in the immediate aftermath of the announcement of Mrs. Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s passing. And I think many of you had the opportunity to see and hear from the President in the Roosevelt Room today where he talked about her legacy and her memory.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo obviously, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that Mrs. Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s family is on the minds of everybody here at the White House, including the President and First Lady, as we know they mourn the loss of Mrs. Reagan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMy understanding is that the planning for her funeral arrangements are still underway. \xc2\xa0So once those arrangements are settled and announced, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to begin working on determining who from the White House would represent the administration at her funeral. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, thank you. \xc2\xa0At the debate last night between the Democratic candidates, and in response to the Flint water crisis, the candidates talked about the Governor -- I think they voiced support for the Governor resigning or being recalled. \xc2\xa0Does the White House agree with that assessment?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I had seen that some of the coverage was animated by that. \xc2\xa0Look, what we have said are a couple of things. \xc2\xa0The first is that there are a couple of investigations to try to get to the bottom of what exactly happened in Flint, what decisions were made and by whom; did they follow the proper protocol. \xc2\xa0And I know at least one of those investigations is an independent investigation by the U.S. Attorney there in Michigan. So I\xe2\x80\x99ve regularly been hesitant to weigh in too aggressively in terms of assigning blame, knowing that this something that a variety of agencies are taking a look at.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat our administration has been focused on is trying to address the significant problem that exists right now in Flint. \xc2\xa0And that means trying to support the state and local officials who are primarily responsible for responding to this incident. \xc2\xa0So there are a number of things that this administration has done over the last week or so to indicate our support for those ongoing efforts. \xc2\xa0And that includes things like committing to expand Medicaid coverage and services for Flint residents. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Wednesday of last week, the Department of Health and Human Services announced an allotment of $3.5 million in emergency funds to expand Head Start in Michigan. \xc2\xa0And I know that the EPA Administrator was also there last week where the EPA awarded a grant that would allow for additional thorough testing of the water in Flint to try to inspire confidence in the residents in that community, in the safety of their water supply. Understandably, that confidence has been shaken. \xc2\xa0And so the more work that we can do to continue to thoroughly test the water there would be beneficial.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing I think that\xe2\x80\x99s relevant is the EPA Administrator -- and this obviously goes far beyond the situation in Flint -- but the EPA Administrator sent a letter to governors across the country, outlining how they can enhance oversight of the so-called Lead and Copper Rule. \xc2\xa0And this would ensure that state and local authorities in other jurisdictions are not taking their eye off the ball when it comes to prioritizing the safety of the water supply. \xc2\xa0To put it more bluntly, the EPA is focused on making sure that what happened in Flint doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen anywhere else. \xc2\xa0And that, I think, would explain the robust communication on the part of the EPA to governors and local officials all across the country about making the enforcement of the Lead and Copper Rule a top priority.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRoberta.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What kind of questions and concerns is the White House hearing from foreign counterparts about some of the things that Donald Trump is saying on the campaign trail?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details of private conversations to share with you. \xc2\xa0I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say in general that we\xe2\x80\x99ve, on a number of occasions, had an opportunity to express our significant concerns with some of the divisive rhetoric that has been uttered on the campaign trail, not just by Mr. Trump, but by a variety of Republican candidates for President. \xc2\xa0Many of those declarative statements are in direct conflict with basic American values, the kinds of values that were critical to the founding of this nation, and values that have long been cherished by generations of Americans.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think the observation that I would make is just simply that other countries are watching. \xc2\xa0The leaders of other countries are watching. \xc2\xa0The populations of other countries are watching. \xc2\xa0And part of a presidential campaign is to demonstrate to the American people, who ultimately will be doing the choosing here, that you have the aptitude to lead the country. \xc2\xa0And that means being a faithful messenger when it comes to articulating the values of the country. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly an important part of what it means to be presidential. \xc2\xa0And I think all too often on the campaign trail, a number of Republican candidates have, at least in my view, fallen quite short of that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask you about something that came up in the debate last night. \xc2\xa0Today, the NRA is saying that Senator Sanders was spot on in his comments about gun manufacturer liability. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the White House thought of those comments, and whether the White House has a position on that proposed law.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of this reporting. \xc2\xa0I did not see the debate itself. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to Senator Sanders to make clear what his position is. \xc2\xa0The clearest enunciation that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen of his position that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed in this briefing room a couple of months ago was his declaration that he supported changes to that 2005 legislation that significantly limited gun manufacturer liability. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has suggested that those kinds of changes that Senator Sanders previously expressed support for are the kind of common-sense changes the President has in mind when he talks about common-sense steps that the Congress could take to make our community safer and to reduce gun violence, or to at least make some incidents of gun violence a little less likely. \xc2\xa0We can take those kinds of steps, and including amending this law in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t undermine the basic constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo again, if Senator Sanders has changed his position on this, you should go ask him and he can explain to you what his position is. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly been clear about what our position is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMary.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Following up on Roberta\xe2\x80\x99s question, in an interview today, the Mexican President said that Donald Trump is hurting the United States\xe2\x80\x99 relationship with Mexico. \xc2\xa0Does the President agree? \xc2\xa0Are Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments hurting that relationship?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see those specific comments. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the President of Mexico is allowed to draw his own conclusions. \xc2\xa0Obviously, President Obama has devoted significant time and energy to working to strengthen our relationship with Mexico. \xc2\xa0That has included confronting the consequences of our broken immigration system. \xc2\xa0That has included making an historic investment in border security. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the United States worked closely with Mexico to try to address a surge in unaccompanied minors at the southwest border. \xc2\xa0And we obviously have been able to work effectively with the Mexicans on that issue. \xc2\xa0But there are a range of other issues where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to coordinate effectively too, including on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the kinds of national security and economic ties between the United States and Mexico are critical to the strength of our economy and our national security. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has invested so deeply in them, and our country\xe2\x80\x99s interests have been advanced as a result. \xc2\xa0And certainly the next President, whoever that happens to be, will have to do that same thing. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto offer up his own assessment of the state of Republican politics.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on Flint, you said rather than assigning blame, you want to focus more on the current response. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s your response then to Senators Lee and Vitter, their effort to hold up this Senate bill to provide funding to Flint? \xc2\xa0Senator Lee says federal aid is not needed at this time, that they have a large enough rainy-day fund to address these issues. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why this needs to be a partisan issue because I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure the Republican governor of Michigan would agree with that assessment. \xc2\xa0I know that there are some Republican members of Congress from Michigan who don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with that assessment. \xc2\xa0But look, the view of the White House is that there is an important role for Congress to play here, and that offering support to the people of Flint as they deal with this difficult situation is important. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt certainly is an important -- is a priority for the administration. \xc2\xa0We have devoted significant resources that I\xe2\x80\x99ve just outlined to try to meet some of their immediate needs. \xc2\xa0I think what the legislation has in mind is trying to address some of the longer-term challenges that are plaguing the water system in Flint. \xc2\xa0That certainly is an appropriate role for Congress to play, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some Republicans stand up and try to block that necessary funding. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tToluse.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask you about the meeting that the President had with financial regulators earlier today. \xc2\xa0Apparently, he said that if Democrats or Republicans are doing anything to undermine Dodd-Frank, that voters should hold him to account. \xc2\xa0And I wanted to ask about the DNC Chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, her position on the pay-day regulation that the consumer protection agency is about to put out. \xc2\xa0She is joining with Republicans, saying that that regulation should be delayed, and any state that has its own regulation should trump whatever the federal agency puts out. \xc2\xa0So I was hoping to get the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position on that, and what you think on whether or not she would be one of the people who\xe2\x80\x99s looked to undermine that part of Dodd-Frank.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Toluse, I have to admit I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of this pending regulation from the CFPB, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz\xe2\x80\x99s position on it. \xc2\xa0I would just say, in general, that our expectation is -- well, let me say it this way. \xc2\xa0The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was established by the Wall Street reform bill because the President believed it was important for middle-class families to have a voice in Washington, D.C, particularly when it comes to basic pocketbook issues. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we know that large financial institutions are able to hire some of the high-powered, high-cost, highly influential lobbyists on K Street to represent them in Congress and to represent them in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0The President felt it was important to have an empowered agency in place to independently represent middle-class families in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau does. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is proud to have presided over the creation of that independent organization. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s been strongly supportive of the work that Mr. Cordray and others have done to look out for middle-class families.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment on any pending regulations they may be considering. \xc2\xa0You can check with them on that. \xc2\xa0But the President certainly is enthusiastic about the important work that they have already done to advocate for consumers in Washington, D.C.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I also wanted to ask you about trade. \xc2\xa0At the debate -- the Democratic debate yesterday, trade was a big topic. \xc2\xa0And there didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be anyone standing up for the President\xe2\x80\x99s trade policy; there actually seemed to be a lot of negativity about trade and how it\xe2\x80\x99s taken out on the middle class in Flint and other places like that. \xc2\xa0On the Republican side, you\xe2\x80\x99re also seeing candidates basically say that the President\xe2\x80\x99s ideas on trade aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to help the middle class. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, does the President plan to stand out and talk about his trade policy and advocate for TPP? \xc2\xa0Because on the campaign trail, there\xe2\x80\x99s no one really actually going there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, you know, Toluse, we had -- this was the subject of some discussion last summer as Congress was working to pass trade promotion authority legislation that would allow the President to essentially complete the negotiations around the TPP. \xc2\xa0And there was a lot of discussion at the time about how on the campaign trail, that candidates in both parties were critical of trade promotion authority legislation because that essentially was a proxy for a referendum on the wisdom of moving forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDespite that opposition on the campaign trail, the President did succeed in working with Republicans in Congress to build a bipartisan majority in both the House and the Senate to get that bill passed. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re looking to build the same kind of coalition to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \xc2\xa0And the crux of the argument, in the mind of the President, essentially comes down to this: \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that the broader economic forces of globalization have hit some communities pretty hard. \xc2\xa0Flint is probably a pretty good example of that. \xc2\xa0There are other communities across the country that have faced some significant headwinds, and seen significant chunks of the economy fade away because of the inexorable forces of globalization.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is, well, what are we going to do about that? \xc2\xa0And we certainly hear a lot of criticism and I think legitimate concern about what impact globalization has on middle-class families. \xc2\xa0But the President actually is putting forward a proposal to address it. \xc2\xa0The President is suggesting that what we should do is we should basically go out and tell other countries, particularly those countries that have economies that are rather dynamic and interested in doing business in the United States, that they can only do business in the United States if they raise their labor standards, if they raise their environmental standards, if they start abiding by commonly viewed -- or commonly observed standards when it comes to human rights; that by engaging in the world, and telling other countries that if they want to do business in the United States that they need to start to level the playing field, that actually will be good for American workers. \xc2\xa0That will be good for American businesses. \xc2\xa0That will be good for our economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the other thing is, we\xe2\x80\x99re also going to tell them that if you want to do business in the United States, not only do you have to raise those standards, you also need to allow the United States and our businesses and our employees to do business in your country, too. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s significant because, again, many of these countries actually have rather dynamic economies that are growing rapidly. \xc2\xa0And one of the chief selling points of the Trans-Pacific Partnership is that it would cut 18,000 taxes that are currently imposed by other countries on goods that are stamped \xe2\x80\x9cMade in the USA.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President actually has a strategy and a proposal for confronting those forces of globalization that have had a negative impact on communities across the country. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s worthy of some debate. \xc2\xa0The President is eager to make that case wherever and whenever he can to try to get Congress to ratify this agreement so we can get to work cutting those taxes and raising those standards and doing the kinds of things that we know would be good for the broader U.S. economy and for middle-class families in this country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more. \xc2\xa0Apparently there\xe2\x80\x99s news that the White House is going to be putting out every year an annual report about drone strikes and how many combatants and non-combatants and civilians are killed each year in those. \xc2\xa0Do you have anything on that? \xc2\xa0How soon might we see the first report on that and how far back might it go? \xc2\xa0Any details you can share?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s top counterterrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco, is giving a speech on this topic right now. And in the context of that speech, she did announce that the administration will, consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s priority that he\xe2\x80\x99s placed on transparency, provide a more regular report for disclosing the results of counterterrorism operations that include specific numbers about extremists and terrorists that were taken off the battlefield, and those individuals who were killed in the operation that were not part of the target.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that, particularly for -- throughout the President\xe2\x80\x99s second term in office, that he has been working to try to take these kinds of programs that are critical to our national security and, where possible, be more transparent about them. \xc2\xa0Because the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that the American public and the world can have greater confidence in the success and the effectiveness of these programs to fight terrorism if we\xe2\x80\x99re more transparent about them. \xc2\xa0There are obviously limitations on that. But there is more that we can do, particularly when it comes to assessing the outcomes of these operations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo for a more cogent and detailed explanation of what our plans are, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to Ms. Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s speech. \xc2\xa0This is obviously something that she has devoted a significant portion of her White House career to working on. \xc2\xa0And so this news that we\xe2\x80\x99re announcing I think is good news, and it certainly is a credit to her skill and professionalism that this is a positive step that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to take.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, last week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and the DNC superdelegate system saying that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold sway over who should be the Democratic presidential nominee. \xc2\xa0The President had to endure the system in 2008, when he was first running, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the system that we have in 2016 for both the current candidates. \xc2\xa0Does he share the concern about superdelegates?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the President weigh in with an opinion on this. \xc2\xa0Obviously these are rules that are determined every four years by the Democratic National Committee, and there is a long process in play leading up to the Democratic Convention for determining how those delegates at that convention will be selected, but I haven\'t heard the President express a specific opinion on this plan. \xc2\xa0So I\'d refer you to the DNC.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think it was fair to -- superdelegates (inaudible) him in 2008?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, those were the rules that everybody understood when they signed up to enter the race back in 2007 and 2008, and everybody knew the rules when they got into the race in 2016 as well. \xc2\xa0And there is a public mechanism for having an impact on those rules if you want to get engaged in the process. \xc2\xa0The DNC -- at least when I worked there -- was committed to the transparent examination of these rules and gave people an opportunity to -- at least gave members of the party the opportunity to weigh in on them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo if people have concerns with that process, I\'d encourage them to take those concerns to the DNC and try to have them addressed in advance of the 2020 convention.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Another question on another issue. \xc2\xa0The Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is visiting the White House this week. \xc2\xa0He has pledged to march in the Toronto LGBT Pride parade in July, and that would make him the first Canadian Prime Minister to march in a LGBT Pride parade. \xc2\xa0In the President\xe2\x80\x99s last year in office, would he be open to marching in an LGBT Pride parade someplace in the country, like here in D.C. in June?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have not heard of a presidential commitment like that. \xc2\xa0My guess is it would not be the first time that he\xe2\x80\x99s marched in a Pride parade --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It would be as President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Probably as President, but not the first time that he has done that. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t have any scheduling updates for you at this point. \xc2\xa0But if that\'s something the President chooses to do we\'ll definitely let you know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Supreme Court -- anything new? \xc2\xa0Can you characterize in any way where the President is in his thinking? \xc2\xa0Has he narrowed the field? \xc2\xa0Is the field still open? \xc2\xa0Is he going to have an announcement this afternoon? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, stay tuned. \xc2\xa0I\'m just kidding. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0There will not be an announcement -- \xc2\xa0I do not expect any news on this -- today. \xc2\xa0The President did devote a significant portion of his weekend to working on this and reviewing the materials that his team had prepared for him about potential candidates. \xc2\xa0The President also spent a portion of his time this weekend talking on the phone with members of the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0He made a number of other calls. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have specific names to share with you, but there were multiple individual conversations between the President of the United States and members of the United States Senate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat I think should underscore for you the priority that the President places on consulting with the Senate. \xc2\xa0This kind of consultation is what led the President to invite Leader McConnell and Chairman Grassley and their Democratic counterparts to the Oval Office last week. \xc2\xa0And the President believes that these kinds of conversations in advance of choosing a nominee are consistent with the expectations of the American people and of the United States Constitution. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you see anything in recent days that gives you more -- a higher expectation that this is going to move forward? \xc2\xa0Have you heard anything in these conversations -- has the President heard anything in these conversations? \xc2\xa0You talked about the polls of -- the public supports your point of view on this. \xc2\xa0Is there anything changing out there, do you think?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that\'s hard to assess. \xc2\xa0I mean, look, I think there have been a number of polls that have come out in the last couple of weeks I do think that indicate that a significant portion of the American people agree that the Senate should fulfill their constitutional duty to give the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee a fair hearing and a timely yes or no vote. \xc2\xa0We certainly take heart in that. \xc2\xa0But I haven\'t noticed a significant change in the polls, but I think it\'s pretty good news that the polls indicate that most people agree with the President on this. \xc2\xa0So that part is good.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI mean, the thing that I did notice, I notice that former Senate Majority Leader -- Senator Republican Leader Trent Lott had some comments on this over the weekend -- they were released today -- where he said something I thought was pretty important. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy attitude particularly on the Supreme Court is that elections do have consequences, sometimes bad, and I tend to lean toward being supportive of the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominees, Democrat or Republican.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\'s exactly the approach that senators have traditionally taken to considering these kinds of nominations. \xc2\xa0It\'s why the Republican refusal to even consider any nominee that the President would put forward is inconsistent with recent precedent, it\'s inconsistent with their constitutional responsibilities, and something that the American people don\'t support.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI did note -- and I don\'t have this part of the quote here \xc2\xa0-- but I did note that former Senator Lott continued saying that he expected that the Judiciary Committee would probably have a hearing for the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee. \xc2\xa0So maybe he senses that something is changing out there. \xc2\xa0We\'ll have to see whether or not that materializes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more. \xc2\xa0You mentioned that the funding request for Zika went nowhere in Congress. \xc2\xa0We know Gitmo seems to be going nowhere in Congress. \xc2\xa0We know the budget seemed to be going nowhere. \xc2\xa0Is there anywhere where you think you\'re going to see some progress in terms of trying to move your agenda forward in the short term? \xc2\xa0What can we look for, what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen that you\'re optimistic about? \xc2\xa0Because I guess there\xe2\x80\x99s a feeling out there about whether or not the administration is really just kind of stuck and not moving forward. \xc2\xa0You mentioned I think about six or seven issue areas some time ago. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think we\'ve seen much there -- or have we and I missed something?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think the case that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from me regularly has been that we\'ve seen a Republican majority in the United States Senate refuse to embrace their responsibility to govern the country; that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been employing obstructionist tactics so consistently over the first six years of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s tenure in the White House that they have not shifted gears to actually trying to lead the country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd some people have I think have made an appropriate link to what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the Republican presidential primary, that at the same time that you see Republicans in Congress refuse to do anything -- even things that are pretty nonpartisan, like ensuring that the government has the resources necessary to protect the country from Zika -- they\xe2\x80\x99re also bemoaning that a candidate who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really stand for anything and certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stand for many principles that are important to the Republican Party is building a lot of support among Republican voters. \xc2\xa0And it\'s sort of consistent with this thing that I said before that, look, if you don\'t stand for somebody your voters are going to fall for anything. \xc2\xa0And that\'s exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s happened on the Republican side.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd it\'s not just these more recent issues, I think all of which are relevant that you\xe2\x80\x99ve raised, but this goes back to health care reform, where Republicans have voted 60 times to repeal the Democratic -- to repeal Obamacare without offering up their own Republican alternative. \xc2\xa0The same thing relates to immigration reform where you have bipartisan legislation that was blocked from even coming up for a vote in the House of Representatives, but no Republican alternative was proposed. \xc2\xa0And the same could be said for gun safety legislation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you\'re arguing that all that is responsible in part for the rise of Donald Trump?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think I\'m not the only person arguing that, I think a lot of people are. \xc2\xa0And a lot of Republicans are. \xc2\xa0And ultimately this is a choice that they have to make: \xc2\xa0Are they going to embrace their responsibility to lead the country?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHere\xe2\x80\x99s the thing. \xc2\xa0This is not a new or unexpected responsibility. \xc2\xa0Leader McConnell wrote an op-ed that appeared in the Wall Street Journal the day after the midterm elections saying, now we can get Congress moving again. \xc2\xa0We haven\'t seen much evidence of that, at least this year. \xc2\xa0Instead what we have seen is not just opposition to the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposals but a refusal to even engage on them, a refusal to even engage on Gitmo, a refusal to engage on the budget. \xc2\xa0They canceled the budget hearings before the President even rolled out his budget proposal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\'ll note that Senate Republicans announced today that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to put off for another month their efforts to draft a budget. \xc2\xa0So it\'s not clear exactly what it is that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing. \xc2\xa0But the result of that is that you have a Democratic President who\xe2\x80\x99s not on the ballot in 2016, who\xe2\x80\x99s not focused on politics, but actually trying to govern the country, try to do the right thing, including filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And what you see from Republicans in the Senate, who vowed to use their majority to get Congress moving again, to actually not do anything and not use the gears of government to even obstruct the President -- because that would be problematic enough -- they\xe2\x80\x99re actually not even doing anything.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that is -- I think that would explain both Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the polls, but also the Republican leaders in Congress and their standing in the polls. \xc2\xa0Congress is held in fairly low regard these days, and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason for that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRich.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0The President just said in his this Wall Street remarks that it is popular to suggest that nothing has happened in regards to fixing the financial regulatory system. \xc2\xa0He calls that political rhetoric. \xc2\xa0Last evening, we watched the Democratic debate in which it was a relentless demonizing of Wall Street, perhaps even suggesting that much more needs to be done to rein in Wall Street. \xc2\xa0Is that the type of rhetoric that he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about? \xc2\xa0The President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what the President has in mind is making sure that people understand the facts of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened. \xc2\xa0Since Wall Street reform was passed we have, in a complicated, fast-moving environment that is the modern financial system, put in place rules and regulations that would reduce the risk that U.S. taxpayers face. \xc2\xa0That\'s a substantial accomplishment. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve done all of that at the same time that our economy has experienced a strong recovery from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\'re currently in the midst of the longest consecutive streak of private sector job growth in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history. \xc2\xa0Over the last six years or so, the economy has created more than 14 million jobs. \xc2\xa0And at the same time, we\'ve been able to put in protections that make our financial system more stable and ensure that taxpayers aren\'t going to be on the hook for bailing out financial institutions whose risky bets go bad.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So why then do we hear so much in Democratic debates, the President\xe2\x80\x99s party, about Wall Street and the need to rein it in and address it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think part of it is that there are people who are frustrated about the fact that in the aftermath of the economic downturn that many financial institutions have benefitted from that recovery quite well. \xc2\xa0And there are a variety of ways to measure that. \xc2\xa0You see large financial institutions reporting record profits on a regular basis. \xc2\xa0We\'ve seen remarkable growth in the value of the stock market. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of ways to measure it. \xc2\xa0And I think a lot of people across the country want to make sure that middle-class families are benefitting, too.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President is certainly focused on that. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why so much of the Recovery Act, for example, was focused on making sure that middle-class families would benefit from tax cuts and other things. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, look, the President is focused on making sure that middle-class families get access to expanded economic opportunity in this country. \xc2\xa0That\'s been a priority when it comes to domestic policymaking. \xc2\xa0And there certainly is more that we can and should do. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to advocating for the Democratic nominee for President who understands that we need to build on the progress that we\'ve made over the last seven years. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0March 17th is a deadline for whether or not the administration would label ISIS as perpetrators of genocide. \xc2\xa0Any update on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any update on that. \xc2\xa0Obviously, this is something that lawyers at the State Department are taking a close look at. \xc2\xa0This designation is something that requires a rather precise interpretation of the law. \xc2\xa0But that certainly does not undermine how seriously we take the atrocities that have been committed by ISIL in Iraq and in Syria.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have seen people be targeted because they are a minority, either a religious or ethnic or racial minority. \xc2\xa0And this administration has taken aggressive steps to protect religious minorities in Iraq and in Syria. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed our concern on a number of occasions about Christians being targeted by ISIL because of their religious views. \xc2\xa0The President has described that as effectively an assault on all people of faith.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President takes that very seriously, and there\xe2\x80\x99s even military action that the President has ordered to try to protect religious minorities. \xc2\xa0And so this is something the President takes quite seriously. \xc2\xa0But as it relates to the genocide designation, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that State Department attorneys will have to take a close look at, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of or interfere in their process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will it meet the deadline, do you believe? \xc2\xa0State Department --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check with the State Department about that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And finally, with the Supreme Court vacancy, does the vacancy specifically -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m saying -- this is for Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s vacancy -- but if it were another Supreme Court justice who left the Court for some reason, does the nominee -- does the vacancy change the nominee at all? \xc2\xa0If another justice were to leave, would that influence who the President would select?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President is conducting his search for a nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court based on his view of who the best person is to do that job.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a lifetime appointment on the highest court in the land, we can\xe2\x80\x99t get distracted by partisan politics. \xc2\xa0The President is very focused on choosing someone who understands that it\xe2\x80\x99s their job to try to interpret the law, not advance a political agenda. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the criteria that the President will use. \xc2\xa0And the President is going to put forward somebody that has extraordinary legal credentials, and that he is confident could serve with honor and distinction on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the criteria that the President will use, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the criteria the President would use regardless of how this vacancy came about. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to go back to U.S. drone strikes. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a report out of the Pentagon today that a U.S. drone strike killed 150 in Somalia -- al Shabaab fighters. \xc2\xa0First of all, can you confirm that? \xc2\xa0Can you expand on that? \xc2\xa0And were there any innocent civilians that were also killed, as well?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I can tell you is that on Saturday, March 5th, the United States military conducted airstrikes in Somalia against Raso Camp, a training facility of al Shabaab. \xc2\xa0As you know, al Shabaab is an al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist organization. \xc2\xa0The fighters who were at that camp were scheduled to depart the camp. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApparently somebody is knocking on the door there. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0You guys want to see if you can ask them to pipe down a little bit? \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s just a reminder of what my home life is like a little bit. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0If I seem particularly skilled at being able to block that out and answer your questions, it\xe2\x80\x99s because I get a lot of practice at that at home. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut back to your original question -- the fighters who were scheduled to depart the camp posed an imminent threat to U.S. and African Union Mission forces in Somalia. \xc2\xa0The removal of those terrorist fighters degrades al Shabaab\xe2\x80\x99s ability to meet the group\xe2\x80\x99s objectives in Somalia, including recruiting new members, establishing bases, and planning attacks on U.S. and AMISOM forces.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is a good example of how the United States military can use our resources and capabilities in partnership with forces on the ground -- in this case, African Union forces -- to counter extremism and protect the United States and our interests. \xc2\xa0And so this is exactly the kind of counterterrorism strategy that the President has laid out.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe last part of this is the Department of Defense is continuing to assess the results of the operation, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm for you at this point the number of fighters who were killed in the operation or whether this had any impact on any civilians who may have been in the area. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI can tell you that the Department of Defense applies the highest possible standard in avoiding civilian casualties before even deciding to move forward on an operation like this. \xc2\xa0So avoiding civilian casualties is a very, very high priority, both for moral reasons but also because extremist organizations like al Shabaab would just use the death of innocent civilians to try to recruit additional members and whip up additional anti-U.S. sentiment. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the Department of Defense goes to great lengths to avoid that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Quick clarification on that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you confirming that it\xe2\x80\x99s a drone strike? \xc2\xa0Because I thought the Pentagon had put out a correction that said it was not.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confirming that it was an airstrike in Somalia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Manned or unmanned?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have additional information. \xc2\xa0For operational details like that, you should check with DOD. \xc2\xa0But, yes, what I\xe2\x80\x99m told is an airstrike. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On another matter, has the President submitted his absentee vote ballot for the Democratic presidential primary in Illinois? \xc2\xa0I think the deadline is March 15th.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s coming up. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s filled out his ballot, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll work on that and see if I can get back to you on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And then, finally, on Nancy Reagan, the President and the First Lady, Michelle Obama, said that she had changed and redefined the role as First Lady. \xc2\xa0Can you expound on that a bit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Mrs. Reagan obviously was a very important partner for her husband, and the President alluded to this in his comments in the Roosevelt Room, as well. \xc2\xa0It was clear, even at the time, that President Reagan relied on her support, on her companionship, but also on her judgment, even on some important issues that he was dealing with. \xc2\xa0And I think that certainly is why so many people respected Mrs. Reagan while she lived here in the White House. \xc2\xa0But I think as historians have gone back to learn more about what transpired in the Reagan White House, they\xe2\x80\x99ve understood that the role that she played was significant. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think her influence and her effectiveness and her -- the moral clarity of her voice I think is something that we all saw publicly. \xc2\xa0She advocated for research when it came to fighting Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc2\xa0Understanding what her family had been through, she leant her credibility and her visibility and her, again, her moral clarity to being heard on that issue, and understanding that if she could advocate for greater research into this field, that she could spare many other families in this country the kind of pain that her family went through and that she even herself personally experienced. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think in some ways, her speaking out on this issue I think was an illustration of the way that she was able to conduct herself even in private. \xc2\xa0And I think that won her the admiration of a lot of Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it a model that the Obamas, the first couple emulate in some ways?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously these kinds of interpersonal relationships I think are different for everybody. \xc2\xa0And I think it would be a gross oversimplification to say that the relationship between one President and First Lady is just like another.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I think the President alluded to this, again, in his comments in the Roosevelt Room, where he noted that Mrs. Reagan was a supportive and unfailingly loyal companion to her husband. \xc2\xa0And President Obama admitted and acknowledged that he benefitted from that kind of -- and he continues to benefit from that kind of loyalty and support from the First Lady in his life. \xc2\xa0That was true before he was President. \xc2\xa0It certainly has been true and particularly important as he\xe2\x80\x99s assumed the weighty responsibilities of the presidency. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident, will appreciate even further in his post-presidency life.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMargaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you mentioned that the President spent time on the phone this weekend with a number of senators. \xc2\xa0Can you characterize what that conversation was like? \xc2\xa0And were there Republicans that the President was calling? \xc2\xa0Was he explaining his thinking on specific nominees? \xc2\xa0Or what was the gist of the conversation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any names to share with you. \xc2\xa0I can just tell you that there were multiple calls that the President placed, and the calls were consistent with the kinds of calls the President has been making over the last couple of weeks, which is having a conversation about the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of his constitutional responsibility to move forward with appointing someone to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President did express an openness to suggestions from the senators about people that could be good candidates for this role. \xc2\xa0And the President laid out the criteria that he will eventually employ in choosing the best person for this job. \xc2\xa0And this is the criteria that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about quite a bit -- this focusing on interpreting the law and not advancing a political agenda, and choosing somebody that has extraordinary and unquestioned legal credentials that they can bring to this very important job.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So no names, but can you say whether there were Republicans on this call sheet?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t say anything further than I have, which is to say that there were multiple senators that the President contacted.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was the President -- I would assume, though, that the President was trying to move the conversation forward, which would mean he\xe2\x80\x99s not just talking to his own party.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think you can assume that the President wanted to demonstrate his commitment to the notion of consulting with the United States Senate about this nomination. \xc2\xa0I think the President was eager to make the case in private for what he\xe2\x80\x99s said publicly on many occasions, which is that there\xe2\x80\x99s no exception in the United States Constitution for election years. \xc2\xa0Every year that the President serves in office, the President is charged with the responsibility of appointing someone to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And the Constitution is also clear that there\xe2\x80\x99s no exception for the United States Senate in election years either, and that the Senate has a responsibility, even in election years, to give that person a fair hearing and a timely yes or no vote. \xc2\xa0And the President explained that thinking, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I take it \xe2\x80\x9copenness to suggestions\xe2\x80\x9d means that the list of nominees is still a work in progress.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the President is continuing to solicit people for their opinions. \xc2\xa0And that means if he hears one that he likes, then he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to -- or if he hears somebody that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t already been considered, that he\xe2\x80\x99s open to adding them to the list.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And should we expect any news this week? \xc2\xa0You ruled out today. \xc2\xa0Do you want to go farther than that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go farther than that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the question of the drone report that Lisa Monaco was laying out, can you explain why the battlegrounds of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan are excluded in terms of explaining the head count of both casualties and terrorists killed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think I know the answer to that question, but let me look into it before I hazard a guess. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up with you and get you an explanation for that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But can you explain what you think this demonstrates about the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think what it demonstrates is a commitment to transparency; that the President believes that being as transparent as possible with the American public, but also with people around the world, about the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking to protect the American people and our interests is important. \xc2\xa0It inspires confidence in our capabilities. \xc2\xa0It also inspires confidence in our ability to carry out these actions consistent with our values. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President has spent a lot of time on the campaign trail when he was campaigning for this job, but certainly over the last seven years, talking about how living up to our values, even as we fight terrorists, is part of what makes America so effective in mobilizing the world to go after terrorist organizations. \xc2\xa0Demonstrating our ability to live up to our values, even in a time of conflict, is an important weapon that we have in our arsenal. \xc2\xa0And the more that we can be transparent about how we conduct these operations and what the result of those operations is only bolsters confidence in our ability to do exactly that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 There obviously are going to be limitations to this. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that the President is going to be in a position to be fully transparent about every single operation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve undertaken against terrorists. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s for obvious reasons. \xc2\xa0But this is an area where the President believed that our fight against terrorists and our ability to mobilize the world to counterterrorism would be more effective if we were more transparent in this area of our policy. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s proposing to do and what his administration will do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But does quantifying the body count of this strategy of having a light footprint but hitting from the air without ground forces, are you concerned that this opens up the administration to more criticism? \xc2\xa0Are you confident that these numbers are going to show that civilian casualties have actually been limited? \xc2\xa0I mean, what\xe2\x80\x99s your expectation about what these numbers are going to show?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think part of this, Margaret, is actually countering some misinformation that\xe2\x80\x99s out there. \xc2\xa0We do see that extremist organizations try to tell a story that\xe2\x80\x99s not at all accurate about the impact of our counterterrorism operations. \xc2\xa0So by publishing the numbers and being more transparent, we can make clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re not just paying lip service to the idea; that our policy puts in place the highest possible standard for avoiding civilian casualties when carrying out these operations. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s something that we take quite seriously. \xc2\xa0Again, we do that for moral reasons, but also because we understand the impact that can have on our ability -- or I guess I should say the ability of terrorists to try to recruit people to their cause. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo in that respect, I think it is important to put out the numbers for that reason to counter those notions, and to make clear -- to provide evidence -- that our commitment to preventing civilian casualties is a serious one. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think that the last thing I would point out is, for a decent portion of this administration and the previous one, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even acknowledge publicly that these things were taking place. \xc2\xa0So the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re now in a position on a regular, routinized basis to publish the results and to quantify that totals about the impact of these operations I do think represents substantial progress in the direction of transparency. \xc2\xa0I will continue to readily acknowledge that there are going to be limits to our ability to be transparent about all this, but there is no denying that we have moved quite a long way in the direction of transparency. \xc2\xa0And the President has only done that because he believes that it enhances our national security interest to demonstrate that we can carry out these operations consistent with our values.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMike.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So just following up on that quickly, and then one other. \xc2\xa0In order for those numbers, for those totals that you just talked about, to be valid, to be seen as valid, and to sort of serve the purpose of transparency that you just described, they\xe2\x80\x99d have to be essentially cumulative and complete, because otherwise you could be easily accused of cherry-picking -- picking the cases that you want to put out there. \xc2\xa0So is it your understanding that, going forward, that essentially this will be a complete list? \xc2\xa0Will it include countries like Pakistan, for example?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I will --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How do you respond to the charge if it\xe2\x80\x99s not complete, if you\xe2\x80\x99re just doing this country but not that country, or these five and not those five? \xc2\xa0How do you combat the charge that you\xe2\x80\x99re essentially picking the ones that don\xe2\x80\x99t have civilian casualties and maybe not showing the other ones? \xc2\xa0And then it sort of -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve the purpose that you suggest.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that it does in terms of -- well, let me just state from here that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a detailed sense to give you at this point about exactly what form the presentation these numbers will take. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more information on that soon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will you list the countries -- can we say Pakistan?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say exactly what these reports will look like, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information on this soon. \xc2\xa0There will obviously be some limitations about where we can be transparent, given a variety of sensitivities, including diplomatic ones. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut again, there is no denying that we have moved from even being loath to confirm that these operations take place anywhere, to not just confirming that they take place in a lot of places, but also sort of tallying up the results. \xc2\xa0I think that is substantial progress, and I do think that it is at least an important data point in demonstrating our commitment to the principle of avoiding civilian casualties. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI also think, Mike, that there\xe2\x80\x99s also a point at which -- there will be some people who say, well, the numbers that you have published are totally wrong. \xc2\xa0So I acknowledge there also will be some people that we won\xe2\x80\x99t ever be able to convince. \xc2\xa0But the President is serious about looking for ways for us demonstrate that we can carry out these operations consistent with our values. \xc2\xa0And I think this data, when it\xe2\x80\x99s released, will at least buttress our ability to make that case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then second, as one of the public faces of the administration and master of public relations and all of that here --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s generous. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- what\xe2\x80\x99s your minimum amount of time that you think you need to schedule a rollout of a Supreme Court nominee from the moment that you find out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. \xc2\xa0Probably not that much time, primarily because we largely know what is entailed in the rollout of a decision, even before the decision has been made about who that person is. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So that planning is already underway?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair for you to say that in general that kind of planning is underway. \xc2\xa0But that should ---<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to come, say, on a state dinner night or on a day that he\xe2\x80\x99s in Austin, Texas -- (laughter) -- some of those things that you\xe2\x80\x99ve thought through, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll allow you to draw your own conclusions about that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTara.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I have a question about the drone strikes. \xc2\xa0You were talking about transparency and how the administration has become much more transparent and there\xe2\x80\x99s been progress. \xc2\xa0And then there\xe2\x80\x99s this strike that we just heard about in Somalia, with 150 people being killed. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can tell me a little bit about what that means for the counterterrorism strategy. \xc2\xa0Because a long time ago, the drone strikes were targeted. \xc2\xa0The whole point was that you knew exactly who was being killed; you knew the names or identifications of the people. \xc2\xa0And now these drone strikes have gone quite big.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me just go back to one element of your question, which is, I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to confirm the results of the operation that I referred to in Somalia against the al Shabaab fighters. \xc2\xa0So the Department of Defense can confirm the outcome here. \xc2\xa0The reason I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that is just that, when I walked out here, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that they would be in a position to confirm the total numbers. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they have done that or not; maybe they have. \xc2\xa0And if they have, then you should go based on what they have given you. \xc2\xa0But I can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm that independently. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMore generally, the President has, unfortunately, had a lot of opportunities to talk about our counterterrorism strategy. \xc2\xa0And we have seen the nature of the threat evolve from one that was focused in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, emanating from core al Qaeda. \xc2\xa0And because of the operations and sustained commitment that this President made to decimating core al Qaeda, the threat has changed. \xc2\xa0That threat is one the President continues to take seriously, but it also means that we have different kind of terrorist groups operating in different parts of the world. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has focused on a counterterrorism strategy that supports local partners. \xc2\xa0We want local partners on the ground that can combat these extremists in their midst. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the way that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be most effective. \xc2\xa0And there are any number of things that the United States and our allies can do to support those local efforts. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn some cases, that means carrying out airstrikes. \xc2\xa0In other cases, that means training and equipping local fighters. \xc2\xa0In other cases, that means sharing valuable intelligence. \xc2\xa0In other cases, that means doing important diplomatic work that can help a variety of countries work together to address the terrorist threat that\xe2\x80\x99s emanating from that region. \xc2\xa0In other cases, that may mean providing economic assistance to a country, to allow them to enhance and strengthen their economy and potentially remove at least one recruiting tool that extremist organizations may be missing. \xc2\xa0But all of this is focused on the idea that while the United States has robust capabilities and the President will not hesitate to order the use of those capabilities to protect the American people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be more effective over the long term, if we build capacity in these countries for individuals and security forces in these countries to fight for their own countries. \xc2\xa0And they can certainly count on the United States to support them as they do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This question is about the refugee crisis in Europe. \xc2\xa0Today, the European leaders are convening in Brussels in order to deal with this crisis. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that you know that Greece is taking its burden -- on its shoulders the burden of this crisis. A lot of thousands of refugees are stuck in Greece right now. \xc2\xa0I would like to know what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s view about this reality right now in Greece, and whether he is concerned and whether he is encouraging the other European states closing their borders and not sharing the burden the responsibility in the spirit of solidarity, actually; and whether or not is he planning to have any telephone conversations with the Greek Prime Minister, because I have noticed that he has spoken with other European leaders but not with the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Tsipras.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any calls with Prime Minister Tsipras that are coming up. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the President has had multiple opportunities to talk to Prime Minister Tsipras on a range of issues. \xc2\xa0A couple of things come to mind here. \xc2\xa0The first is, there is no denying that the flow of migrants largely from Iraq and in Syria has strained the solidarity of the European Union. \xc2\xa0This has been a very difficult challenge not just for Greece but for other countries in the EU. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd one of the things that we -- so the unity of that union will be put to the test. \xc2\xa0And we certainly believe that Europe will be able to better respond to this threat if they continue to work together to confront it. \xc2\xa0Let me give you one example of how that\xe2\x80\x99s being done. \xc2\xa0There are reports that NATO has dedicated resources to countering human smuggling and human trafficking in the Aegean. \xc2\xa0That certainly is a welcome development and is an indication of other countries throughout Europe devoting resources to try to address this big challenge. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ll say -- and this sort of goes back to something that\xe2\x80\x99s been the focus of our efforts for quite some time here, which is that we have long acknowledged that the political failure of the Assad regime inside of Syria has had a variety of negative consequences on the region. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly seen Syria become a war-torn country. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen extremists establish a foothold in their country. \xc2\xa0And they have used that foothold to try to menace other countries, not just Iraq, but even some extremists that are carrying out operations in Europe. And we know that there were ties from those who carried out the Paris attacks back in November to extremists in Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why this administration has been so focused on -- well, to say nothing of the significant numbers of Syrians who have fled their homes and fled their country, and sought refuge in Europe. \xc2\xa0The only way to address this, ultimately and finally, is to try to address the political chaos and turmoil and failures inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States has played a leading role in the diplomatic effort to try to bring about the political transition inside of Syria that\xe2\x80\x99s long overdue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But would the President like to see European leaders doing something more, faster and better, dealing with this problem?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously this is going to be a big challenge for Europe. \xc2\xa0The United States will support the European Union and our many close allies in Europe as they confront this threat. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, this is something that will be their responsibility.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGoyal, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Two quick questions. \xc2\xa0One, as far as U.S. relations are concerned, they are on the move under President Obama, and President Obama and Prime Minister Modi. \xc2\xa0And as far as the U.S.-India Business Council and the Indian American community is concerned, they\xe2\x80\x99re also -- they have the same views. \xc2\xa0But recently, as far as the H-1B visa feud is concerned between U.S. and India -- and those have affected thousands of jobs in the U.S. and hundreds of Indian companies are doing business here. \xc2\xa0Now they are saying that this feud may cause some problems as far as trade or business are concerned. \xc2\xa0Is the President aware of this case in WTO as far as the H-1B visa for India is concerned against the U.S.?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Goyal, I have to admit that I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of this specific situation, so why don\xe2\x80\x99t I have somebody at -- one of my colleagues follow up with you on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And second, according to the news reports, recently Pakistan had here -- of course U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue. \xc2\xa0But one report is saying that Pakistan may sell nuclear plan to Saudi Arabia. \xc2\xa0Is there anything the White House knows about this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Goyal, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that report either, but let me see if we can have somebody follow up with you on it, okay? \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have better answers for you today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHope you have a good day. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:12 P.M.
