EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As you know, following the inadvertent release of sensitive information during the President\xe2\x80\x99s most recent trip to Afghanistan, the White House Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough, asked White House Counsel Neil Eggleston to look into what happened and report back to him with recommendations on how the administration can improve processes and make sure something like this does not happen again.</p>\n<p>The White House Counsel briefed the Chief of Staff last night on the information he collected, and provided recommendations to prevent the release of such information in the future.\xc2\xa0 The Chief of Staff has accepted those recommendations and has asked the White House staff, including the White House Office of Communications, the Office of Scheduling and Advance, and the National Security Council, to begin implementing them immediately.</p>\n<p>So let me walk you through with these three recommended process improvements are.</p>\n<p>On international trips with the President -- when there are meetings that are open to press coverage, a member of the White House Scheduling and Advance staff will conduct a briefing prior to the President\xe2\x80\x99s arrival to notify meeting participants that their names and titles will be released to the press in a pool report, and give participants an opportunity to raise concerns.\xc2\xa0 This recommendation will also apply to any event where a list of participants will be made publicly available to the press -- for instance, in a public event where there are people on stage with the President.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The second recommended process improvement:\xc2\xa0 Again, on international trips with the President -- the White House press lead will clear the names and titles of meeting participants with National Security Council staff prior to the distribution of those names and titles to the press.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With White House Counsel staff you said?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 With national security staff, prior to the distribution of those names and titles to the press.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then third and finally, the White House Scheduling and Advance staff and the White House Communications staff will receive additional training to enhance awareness and improve handling of sensitive information.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In going back over this, what did you determine went wrong?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what they determined is that the release of information was inadvertent.\xc2\xa0 And what the Counsel had been tasked with was devising some recommended process improvements to safeguard against this kind of inadvertent disclosure from happening again.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why these were the recommendations that were offered by the White House Counsel, and the Chief of Staff accepted them and directed that they be implemented.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you able to say whether -- who was at fault?\xc2\xa0 I mean, was it the base personnel who just sort of inadvertently didn\xe2\x80\x99t know who was going to be getting this information and so they included the CIA station chief, or White House staff who didn\xe2\x80\x99t give them a warning, or what exactly?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They were not focused on trying to isolate any specific wrongdoing because this disclosure was inadvertent.\xc2\xa0 But given the seriousness of this circumstance, the White House Counsel was tasked with coming up with some process improvements that would prevent a disclosure like this from happening again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, which of these things were not already being done?\xc2\xa0 Was the White House press lead not already clearing with the national security staff who was on the list going out, for instance?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think as a matter of -- to my understanding, as a matter of course, these things were not being done.\xc2\xa0 They were occasionally being done, but not rigorously as a matter of course being done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Based on my own experience, I can tell you that these things often occur, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t occur every time.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what will change.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And were there any punishments meted out, or any firings or anything?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard of any.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I have to report in this context.\xc2\xa0 Again, what this review was focused on was determining the nature of the release -- in this case, they determined that it was inadvertent -- and putting in place some process improvements that would make sure that this didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, how will you determine whether a name is actually removed from a list?\xc2\xa0 Is it just because an individual doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want their name disclosed to the press, or would there have to be some underlying reason?\xc2\xa0 Because otherwise, just because somebody doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want their name out to us, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have access to it, there would be no reason.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 In all of these circumstances we\xe2\x80\x99re balancing our commitment to transparency with the need to protect some information for national security reasons.\xc2\xa0 So as we implement these recommendations, that will be a built-in tension that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to manage.\xc2\xa0 But, frankly, that\xe2\x80\x99s a tension that we manage every time we do public events like this.</p>\n<p>Ostensibly, Jim, particularly with your photographers taking pictures of people who are appearing with the President, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be difficult to be in a situation where people are taking pictures of somebody with the President in a public place where there\xe2\x80\x99s ready press access.\xc2\xa0 Without a good reason, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to not provide that person\xe2\x80\x99s name.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right now.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, the exception to that is when it\xe2\x80\x99s a large group of people -- that you go to these rallies where there are hundreds of people behind the President.\xc2\xa0 In this very specific circumstance, particularly on international trips, this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll manage.\xc2\xa0 But I think it will be -- the end result I think will be consistent with what has been, as Jon sort of alluded to, our standard practice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just on recommendation one -- if someone did object to their name being included, would the White House then provide a list with that name omitted, as if the person were never there?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we would have to work through this.\xc2\xa0 Even when the President was in Afghanistan, for example, the President participated in private meetings that the press didn\xe2\x80\x99t have access to and so didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have a manifest for each of those meetings.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that if there were an individual that did have a concern about being publicly disclosed, that their participation in a public meeting is probably not a very good idea, right?</p>\n<p>So we would probably find a more appropriate venue for them to either meet with the President or not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the Counsel brief the CIA on this?\xc2\xa0 Have they responded?\xc2\xa0 Did they need to respond?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to what specific communication the Counsel had with the CIA in this matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were all the people involved in this -- advance staff, et cetera -- interviewed?\xc2\xa0 Was that the way this procedure worked?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into the specifics of who actually the Counsel spoke to in the context of this review.\xc2\xa0 But getting some clarity about what actually happened and what steps could be implemented to prevent it from happening again required a substantial number of conversations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With who?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, with people who have knowledge of what occurred and how it occurred and what the regular process is.\xc2\xa0 Those are the people who would be in the best position to help the Counsel identify some proposed improvements that would prevent this from happening again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But were these adopted today?\xc2\xa0 Or when were these adopted?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I just asked this question. \xc2\xa0Let me see if I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a clear answer here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They were recommended last night?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Stand by for one second.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the CIA station chief was pulled out of Afghanistan, do we?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All we know is the CIA has, when asked about this a week or two ago, said that his situation had been addressed.\xc2\xa0 But I think that\xe2\x80\x99s as specific as they got.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean he\xe2\x80\x99s not there anymore?\xc2\xa0 When you said -- earlier, you said there had been no firings, punishments in this context.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a plain English version of what --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say -- I actually added -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been any.\xc2\xa0 I think I just said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any to talk about in the context of this report, in this review.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there any -- some linked to this that are not linked to the review?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to be cagey here, guys.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Does it seem like I am?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is aware of all this, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he is.\xc2\xa0 The President was briefed on this last night.\xc2\xa0 So at this point, in terms of the timing, what I would say to you is that this review was complete last night and the President was briefed on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it was White House Communications Agency, the NSC, and then there was a third one?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The White House communication office.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, essentially the press office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then there was a third one.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The National Security Council and the White House Office of Scheduling and Advance.\xc2\xa0 So these are essentially the personnel -- it\xe2\x80\x99s personnel from these three offices that are responsible for both planning and executing these events and then communicating the details of these events to the media when the events have press access.</p>\n<p>All right, if there are additional questions, just email me.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t6:56 P.M.
