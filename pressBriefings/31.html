EDT</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 Hey, everyone, and welcome on board en route to New Mexico.\xc2\xa0 As you know -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll do a little topper here on what you guys can expect for this weekend and then happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">So, as you know, the President and First Family are headed to Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, and Yosemite National Park, where they\xe2\x80\x99ll be visiting two of the many national parks across our country that add great value for families and communities both recreationally and, of course, as critical economic drivers. And they\xe2\x80\x99re making this trip as part of our national celebration of the 100th anniversary of our National Park System.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">So the President understands that no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change, and our conservation efforts need to meet this challenge.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why, since taking office, the President has protected more than 265 million acres of public lands and waters across the country</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">-- which is more than any other President in history -- and he\xe2\x80\x99s taken unprecedented steps to protect our planet for future generations.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">In addition, the President has helped ensure that all Americans have greater opportunities to experience our nation\xe2\x80\x99s unparalleled national parks and monuments, including by launching the Every Kid in a Park initiative, which gives every fourth-grader and their families across the U.S. free access to visit the country\xe2\x80\x99s public lands and waters.\xc2\xa0 And according to a report that was recently released by the National Park Service, more than 305 million people have visited America\xe2\x80\x99s national parks in 2015, which is an all-time record, with visitors spending $16.9 billion in nearby local communities.\xc2\xa0 So, obviously, this is an economic driver as well.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Specifically, in New Mexico, where we\xe2\x80\x99re headed now, where we have 15 national parks, 1.7 million visitors spent $97 million in local economies, and that\xe2\x80\x99s supported over 1,500 jobs.\xc2\xa0 And in California, where we have 27 national parks, 38.4 million visitors spent $1.8 billion in local economies, and that supported 25,000 jobs.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">So, obviously, in addition to the steps the President has taken to make it easier for Americans to get outside and enjoy the public lands, there\xe2\x80\x99s some economic value to the communities that these national parks serve as well.\xc2\xa0 And so the President and First Family are looking forward to spending some time in the beautiful parks this weekend.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">So with that, happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any reaction from the White House to the internal State Department memo that\xe2\x80\x99s very critical of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Syria policy?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Darlene.\xc2\xa0 So I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read the memo, so without getting into any specifics of it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say sort of generally that the administration obviously welcomes a strong deliberation on foreign policy challenges that face our nation.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Kerry noted today that he looks forward to reading this memo.\xc2\xa0 And, as the President has said and others have said, we\xe2\x80\x99re always open to new or different ideas when it comes to the challenges in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And the President certainly expects a robust discussion to be brought forward.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">And so, without getting into details of any national security meetings or discussions, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a very close look at this over the course of the last few years and are certainly receptive to ways to facilitate our objectives.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">But let me just be clear about what the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach has been.\xc2\xa0 First, the President has always been clear that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see a military solution to the crisis in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that remains the case.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on the threat posed by ISIL and terrorist groups in Syria.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been relentless in pursuing ISIL and the external operations of leaders of al Qaeda in Syria, and working with a variety of local partners on the ground.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">As you heard Brett McGurk say in briefing you all exactly a week ago, ISIL has lost 20 percent of their footprint in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And, as we all know, Assad has brutalized his own people, and even his allies in Russia and Iran have acknowledged the imperative of a political transition.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re working with the international community on a Syrian-led transition process facilitated by the U.N.\xc2\xa0 And, as you also know, Secretary Kerry has been working intensively to reduce the violence in Syria through a Cessation of Hostilities, both to ensure regular and routine humanitarian access, and then to set the conditions for a political transition.\xc2\xa0 And since the cessation of hostilities went into effect, 820,000 Syrians have received aid.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">So, needless to say, this is obviously tough work that our diplomats are pursuing every day.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that there would be a diversity of opinion on how best to achieve these goals in Syria.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, has the President seen the memo or read it?\xc2\xa0 Or will he have a chance to read it, or any interest in reading it?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President has seen the memo.\xc2\xa0 I am not aware that he\xe2\x80\x99s read it.\xc2\xa0 As you know, this is an internal memo to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry noted he was looking forward to reading the memo.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, you said that the White House has been open to all ideas on this, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve also said that the White House -- the President believes there\xe2\x80\x99s no military solution.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can say whether or not the President is open to this idea of targeted strikes -- and if not, why not -- against the Syrian government.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just reiterate that the President has been clear and continues to be clear that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see a military solution to the crisis in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And so that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be discussions or a variety of conversations and a variety of opinions, but that fundamental principle still remains.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are reports that the U.S. is putting a hold on the transfer of cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia because of civilian death over there.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that is the case?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to confirm at this point, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that and let you know if we have anything on that for you.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more on Syria.\xc2\xa0 You said there\xe2\x80\x99s no military solution, but it seems that this memo is saying that -- not trying to provide a military solution, but using the military to strengthen the diplomatic process, sort of forcing Assad\xe2\x80\x99s hand</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">-- forcing him to be more honest in the diplomatic process.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the White House agrees with?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read the memo so I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to get into any of the specifics.\xc2\xa0 We certainly welcome strong deliberation on these challenges generally, but the sort of principles that I outlined still remain the same.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fifty-one people signed the memo.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House find that embarrassing?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think, as Secretary Kerry said this morning, he looks forward to receiving and reviewing the memo.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d sort of refer you to the State Department to give some more details about the process of these dissent memos.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">But as I understand it, this is an existing official vehicle that\xe2\x80\x99s in place to allow State Department employees to convey alternative views and perspectives on policy issues.\xc2\xa0 And so they might have more to say on that.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is Secretary Kerry -- you said he\xe2\x80\x99s open to meeting with these people.\xc2\xa0 Would it be something that the President would be open to as well, to meeting with this group of State Department people?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any sort of meetings or possible meetings to outline at this point.\xc2\xa0 But for now, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to what Secretary Kerry said on this this morning.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House or the President has been made aware of the killing of the Parliament member in Britain, which earlier reports suggest could be a -- may have been carried out by someone who was sort of -- had anti-Muslim sentiments in Britain.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House had a reaction at all to that, what was happening there.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, David.\xc2\xa0 So we offer our most sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones of UK member of Parliament Jo Cox, who was brutally murdered yesterday in the course of doing her public duty.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, this is a tragedy and our hearts go out to the family.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the investigation or any of the specifics you\xe2\x80\x99re asking about regarding this terrible crime, we\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the UK authorities who we understand are already investigating this heartbreaking incident.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as for the Deputy Crown Prince meeting, do you have a readout of that meeting with the President?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 In fact, I do, which -- as you know, this meeting wrapped up a little bit before we took off today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">So President Obama met this morning in the Oval Office with His Royal Highness Mohammad Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia to continue discussions that they\xe2\x80\x99d begun in April at the U.S. Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in Riyadh.\xc2\xa0 The President expressed appreciation for Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s contributions to the campaign against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Reviewing recent Iraqi gains against ISIL, the President and Deputy Crown Prince discussed steps to support the Iraqi people, including increased Gulf support to fund urgent humanitarian and stabilization needs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">On Syria, they reaffirmed the importance of supporting the cessation of hostilities and a political transition away from Assad.\xc2\xa0 The President and Deputy Crown Prince also agreed to build support for Libya\xe2\x80\x99s Government of National Accord.\xc2\xa0 And with regard to Yemen, the President welcomed Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to concluding a political settlement of the conflict and of GCC support to address urgent humanitarian needs and rebuild the country.\xc2\xa0 And, more broadly, the President and Deputy Crown Prince discussed Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities and agreed to explore avenues that could lead to de-escalation of tensions. They also discussed the important role Saudi Arabia can play in addressing extremist ideology.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Finally, the President commended the Deputy Crown Prince\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to reform of the Kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s economy, and underscored strong U.S. support for achieving the recently announced Vision 2030 goals.\xc2\xa0 The Deputy Crown Prince underscored Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s strong support for the Paris agreement and welcomed cooperation with the United States on clean energy issues.\xc2\xa0 And the President and Deputy Crown Prince reaffirmed the strategic partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that the Deputy Crown Prince\xe2\x80\x99s economic plan to wean the Kingdom off oil is feasible?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 So, Roberta, as you know, the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic team, the National Economic Council, along with a number of Secretaries -- Treasury Secretary Lew, Commerce Secretary Pritzker, Energy Secretary Moniz -- also met with the Deputy Crown Prince yesterday, and both sides agreed on the importance of both economic diversification, expanding private sector employment opportunities and renewable and natural gas development, and sort of the beneficial role that U.S. companies could play in implementing Saudi reform objectives.\xc2\xa0 And so all those things were discussed yesterday.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the President was talking about sort of national solidarity in a time of crisis.\xc2\xa0 He had a Republican senator on board Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 But back in Washington, his opponent in the 2008 election essentially, initially seemed to blame the President personally for what happened in Orlando.\xc2\xa0 And I wondered if the President was aware of what Senator McCain said, if he understood his sort of longer explanation afterward or whether he believes that that kind of rhetoric is out of bounds in any way.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 So, David, last week, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall a certain Republican presidential candidate made a similar comment, and at that time, when you all asked Josh for his reaction, he said we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be distracted by small things.\xc2\xa0 And so that applies to this situation as well.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think it\xe2\x80\x99s small?\xc2\xa0 You think it\xe2\x80\x99s small what one of the leading Republicans in saying in terms of what the -- about the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying what the President is focused on is exactly what he was talking about yesterday when he was in Orlando visiting with the victims and -- the families of victims and some of the survivors of the horrible attack last weekend.\xc2\xa0 And at that moment, he was explaining to everyone that we\'re going to have to all work together at all levels of government, across political lines, and do more to stop these killers who want to terrorize us.\xc2\xa0 And he was sending a powerful message.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask about another Republican -- the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, has now said publicly he will not support Donald Trump and not vote for Donald Trump.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if the President, who has spoken out very forcefully about how he sees Donald Trump and the dangers associated with electing someone like that to the highest office in the land, would the President in any way try to reach out to governors like Larry Hogan or others, Republicans who are willing to speak out against their standard bearer in any way, sort of offer his support to them or sort of in any way show a partnership with those kind of governors, or even other Republicans.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President obviously has had a number of things to say on this topic generally, and I think you can expect that he will continue to make the case for the policies that Democrats are putting forward and their vision for the country, and the importance of what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake in this election.\xc2\xa0 And I think you can expect to see that in the weeks and months ahead.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any specific previews of potential support of candidates that he\'ll be supporting.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the readout you mentioned the President talking about combating extremist ideology within Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that Secretary Clinton said in a recent speech, that the Saudis need to do more to combat terrorist ideology and financing.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President brought up explicitly during this meeting?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any more details beyond these topics that they discussed that I referenced here in this readout.\xc2\xa0 So I\'ll let you know if we have any additional details.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday the President made a powerful statement in his remarks in Orlando about combating discrimination against women and discrimination against the LGBT community even when it occurs overseas.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if he brought up those issues with the Deputy Crown Prince today.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that came up in his conversation today, specifically.\xc2\xa0 Obviously you heard the President reference this just yesterday and a number of other times, and that\'s something that is a priority for him in general.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t know if that came up in this specific conversation.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a year since churchgoers were killed in Emanuel Church in South Carolina.\xc2\xa0 And we all remember the President when he went there and delivered the eulogy and saying -- are there any plans for the President to acknowledge that anniversary in any way today?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 So, Darlene, I don\'t have any schedule updates or anything like that for you on this today.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President spoke at great length yesterday and then earlier in the week as well -- yesterday, in particular, to the families of many of the victims of Orlando and to a number of the survivors, and had spent what was I think a very emotional and moving couple of hours just talking with them and expressing his support and condolences.\xc2\xa0 And so I think that certainly applies to many of the families of the victims and other survivors from a number of these tragedies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously, quite sadly, and the President noted, more than just the tragedy in Orlando.\xc2\xa0 This is just the latest example.\xc2\xa0 And so I think his words yesterday would be applicable to a broad range of these tragedies.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The BREXIT vote is about a week away.\xc2\xa0 There are several polls showing that Britons are sort of leaning towards voting to leave the EU.\xc2\xa0 Is the President worried about that, and can we expect him to do anything more in the next week to express his opinion?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MR. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about this generally when he was visiting the UK in April, where he expressed his views pretty clearly.\xc2\xa0 I would note that in light of the tragedy in the UK *today [yesterday] with a member of Parliament who was brutally murdered, the campaign there has been suspended -- the BREXIT campaign there has been suspended for the day.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\'t expect we would have anything in particular to say today, and certainly nothing beyond what the President expressed pretty clearly in April when he was there.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The AP is out with new numbers that 234 women, pregnant women in the U.S. have reported cases of Zika, and a number of incidents of microcephaly have been reported as a result of that. Understanding that legislation is still held up in Congress, with the summer months approaching and these mosquitoes with the Zika virus coming to the U.S. and landing here, affecting U.S. citizens, is there anything more that the President can do to speed up this funding, or anything he can do aside from what\xe2\x80\x99s being held up in Congress?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s a really good question and it\'s a really important question for Congress to answer -- which is, why it\'s taken more than four months to approve the request that we submitted for $1.9 billion in funding to make sure that we have what we need to combat the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 And as you note, as mosquito season is upon us and certainly in certain regions of the country more so than others, it\'s becomes absolutely all that more critical that Congress act quickly to give states and local communities the funding they need to address this significant public health issue.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">And so I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President make this case and lay out why that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s not just the President.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard his public health experts outline in great detail what it is they need the money for, again, particularly in many of our local states and -- our local communities and states across the country.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">And so it\'s absolutely time for Congress to act.\xc2\xa0 And I think the question should be, why haven\'t they done so yet.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a couple more about this trip that we\'re on right now?\xc2\xa0 I\'m just trying to understand -- I understand the tie-in to the national parks\xe2\x80\x99 100th anniversary.\xc2\xa0 But is this trip also something like that the First Family wanted to do and the First Lady or the daughters expressed an interest in, and the timing is such that it coincides with the 100th anniversary?\xc2\xa0 Or is this a trip because it\'s the 100th anniversary, the First Family is making this trip to make a point specifically?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 So I think both things can be true, that they wanted to visit our nation\xe2\x80\x99s national parks, which, as you know, the First Family has done in the past.\xc2\xa0 And this is, again, something that is critically important during the national celebration of the 100th anniversary of the National Parks System.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is this a trip based on Malia\xe2\x80\x99s graduation, or summer break -- you know, it\'s summer break time, we\'re going on a family trip, and that\'s what sort of the genesis of it is?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how long ago was this being talked about as something that the Obamas wanted to do and being looked into, I guess?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it should be any surprise that this is the kind of trip and activity that the President and First Family would be interested in doing, as they have done so before.\xc2\xa0 I think what is important is the President\xe2\x80\x99s record when it comes to conservation and the importance of climate change.\xc2\xa0 These are issues that I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk about a little bit --</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess a better way to ask it, is this trip -- if I\'m not mistaken, when they go to Hawaii or things like that, or maybe Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard, the rental compound where the First Family stays is paid for I think by the family to some degree.\xc2\xa0 And I just wonder, is this a personal trip, or is this a policy trip?\xc2\xa0 And how is it being funded.\xc2\xa0 For example, there are accommodations in parks, for example, overnight.\xc2\xa0 Is that more of a family thing and are they paying for it?\xc2\xa0 Or is this more of a policy-oriented trip?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have those details in terms of who\xe2\x80\x99s paying.\xc2\xa0 I can see if there is anything additional we can get you on that.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that the President, as he has done many times in the past, is going to be highlighting not just the record of progress we\'ve seen in terms of conservation efforts and climate change, but what more we need to do.\xc2\xa0 And I think particularly for the Every Kid in a Park initiative, which I something you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk about before, which is an initiative that he\xe2\x80\x99s been working on for many years, is all the more important this year -- recognizing the 100th anniversary of</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">our national parks.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last one on that is, I know this trip has been planned well before the past week or so.\xc2\xa0 In light of the tragedy, I\'m wondering if the White House thought or considered in any way postponing or cancelling the trip.\xc2\xa0 Was that discussed?\xc2\xa0 If yes, what was the conclusion on that?\xc2\xa0 If no, is there any particular reason why not?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 So, look, David, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s response and the entire administration\xe2\x80\x99s response to the tragedy of last weekend has been pretty evident throughout the week.\xc2\xa0 If you recall, last Sunday, as soon as we heard about the *remarks [attack], the President went out and talked about exactly what he knew, updated the American people on the tragic events.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, as you recall, he was briefed by his FBI Director and a number of national security officials, and made sure to give the American people an update about we\'re doing regarding this tragedy.\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, he met with his broader national security team at the Treasury Department, talked about our ongoing efforts to counter ISIL around the world.\xc2\xa0 And then on Thursday, the President went to Orlando, and as we just discussed, spent a good deal of time with the families and survivors there.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">So I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the tragedy last week is pretty clear.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be doing any interviews while he\xe2\x80\x99s visiting any of these national parks?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll let you know if we have anything like that planned for the weekend.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- on how the President will spend his time in the park, at Yosemite, in particular, after tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to do and see there.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 As I think I mentioned, and you all know, you should expect you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the President at some point tomorrow in Yosemite, and you\'ll have a chance for him to talk a little bit about his efforts in this area and what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing.\xc2\xa0 And then I think you can expect there will be a little bit of private family time to experience all the park has to offer themselves.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">All right, week ahead.\xc2\xa0 So on Monday, the President will deliver remarks at the SelectUSA Investment Summit at the Washington Hilton in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">On Tuesday, the President will travel to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where he\'ll visit with wounded servicemembers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">On Wednesday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">On Thursday, the President will travel to San Jose, California, to participate in the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, which is the seventh installment of the summit and final of his presidency.\xc2\xa0 And this will showcase America\xe2\x80\x99s diverse entrepreneurial spirit and feature entrepreneurs from across the globe.\xc2\xa0 The President will remain overnight in San Jose.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">And then on Friday, the President will participate in the Global Entrepreneurship Summit before traveling to Seattle, Washington, where he\'ll attend an event for Governor Jay Inslee in a DCCC event.\xc2\xa0 And then the President will remain overnight in Seattle.\xc2\xa0 And then on Saturday, he\'ll return to Washington.</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A White House-organized summit?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS. FRIEDMAN:\xc2\xa0 It is the White House in conjunction with partners.\xc2\xa0 We can get you some additional information about who is actually organizing that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know, is he leaving on Saturday morning then to Washington?\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, Jen -- do you know the timing when he comes back?</p>\n<p style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal;">MS.
