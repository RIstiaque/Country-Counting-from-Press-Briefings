EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us today.\xc2\xa0 We will go straight to the questions.\xc2\xa0 The President, as many of you know, is convening a meeting this afternoon at 3:30 p.m. in the Cabinet Room with members of his team who are responsible for responding to the Ebola diagnosis in Texas.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m actually manifested for that meeting, so I need to leave here about 3:25 p.m.\xc2\xa0 Would be a little embarrassing to walk in late.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, so I don\'t want to be late.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, with that, Darlene, do you want to get us started?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any more details on the meeting that you said you\'re going to?\xc2\xa0 What does the President want to get out of it?\xc2\xa0 Who are some of the people who are participating?\xc2\xa0 And does this in any way affect the travel that\'s on the schedule for tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Darlene, the President is convening members of his team who have been responsible for responding to the Ebola situation in this country.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to do that because he wants to make sure that all of the needed resources of the federal government are being deployed to deal with this specific situation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'ll have a full manifest of those who are participating in the meeting for you.\xc2\xa0 At the conclusion of the meeting you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to hear directly from the President himself about what decisions were made in the course of that meeting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At this point, I don\'t have any changes to tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s schedule to announce.\xc2\xa0 We\'re obviously operating at a pretty dynamic environment right now, so we\'ll do our best to keep you updated.\xc2\xa0 If there is something that requires a change in the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule then we\'ll definitely let you know.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain why he thought it was necessary to cancel both trips, both stops in New Jersey and Connecticut, to stay here and have this meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, we have a second diagnosis of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is a health care worker who was working to treat the patient at Texas Presbyterian Hospital, the first individual who had been diagnosed with Ebola in this country.\xc2\xa0 So that indicates the seriousness of this situation.\xc2\xa0 And the President believed that it was important to convene the senior members of his team who are responsible for coordinating this response, and the President was not able to host that meeting and travel at the same time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what we have always indicated is that the President of the United States is President wherever he goes, and that\'s true 24/7.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is if the President determines that it\'s necessary for him to return to the White House to fulfill his responsibilities as the leader of the country and as the Commander-in-Chief, then he\'ll alter his schedule accordingly.\xc2\xa0 And the decision that we made about today\xe2\x80\x99s schedule is consistent with that guiding principle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know this question was asked yesterday; I wanted to ask it again today.\xc2\xa0 Does the President and the White House -- is there continued confidence in Dr. Frieden to lead the CDC at this time?\xc2\xa0 And also, is the administration now going to rethink the idea of appointing someone to be an Ebola czar, given this new urgency?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The answer to your first question is yes.\xc2\xa0 Throughout this process and throughout this response -- dating all the way back to March, I might add -- this administration has been guided by the science, by our medical experts who have experience in dealing with Ebola outbreaks.\xc2\xa0 For almost four decades now, the global health community, led by the United States, has been dealing with Ebola outbreaks in Africa, and as we are dealing with a public health situation in this country, we continue to be guided by the advice of medical experts and scientists who have knowledge in this field and can use that knowledge to protect the American people.</p>\n<p>As it relates to a so-called Ebola czar, I\'ll reiterate what we\'ve said in the past on this, which is that we have designated very clear lines of responsibility in terms of which agencies are responsible for which aspects of this response.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got CDC and USAID personnel who are operating in West Africa to work with those local governments to try to meet the urgent humanitarian public health needs in those countries.\xc2\xa0 You have a Department of Defense that is responding to the orders of the President of the United States to set up enhanced logistical capacity so that the international community can benefit from improved logistics as they seek to move equipment and personnel into the region to try to confront this outbreak.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ve got Department of Homeland Security staffers that are responsible for securing our transportation infrastructure and monitoring individuals who are entering this country at ports of entry across the map.\xc2\xa0 And then, in addition to that, you have HHS and CDC officials who are responsible for coordinating with state and local public health authorities to ensure that the American public is safe.\xc2\xa0 And there are clear lines of authority for each of those sets of responsibilities.</p>\n<p>At the same time, you have the President\xe2\x80\x99s chief Homeland Security Advisor, Lisa Monaco, working here at the White House who is responsible for integrating the efforts of all of the agencies and making sure that they have access to the information and resources that they need to do their job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All of that said, we have said on a number of occasions that if additional resources or if additional staffing is necessary to augment the response, then we won\'t hesitate to consider it.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, the lines of authority are clear and the person responsible for coordinating those efforts here at the White House continues to do that work well.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it sounds like you\'re not inclined to appoint a czar.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there are clear lines of responsibility that are in place.\xc2\xa0 There is an individual here at the White House, highly competent individual, Lisa Monaco, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Homeland Security Advisor, who is responsible for integrating that response.\xc2\xa0 But, again, if we determine that additional resources or additional staffing or additional expertise is needed to augment this response, then we won\'t hesitate to take advantage of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President wanting to know how this health care worker was able to get on a commercial plane?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a number of things that we\'re eager to know.\xc2\xa0 The first is -- and this is the subject of an investigation by CDC officials -- is to determine exactly how this virus was transmitted from the so-called index patient in Dallas to at least two of the health care workers who were treating him.\xc2\xa0 That is the focal point of an investigation that the CDC is expediting, at the direct order of the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>The other thing that the CDC is reviewing are the protocols that were in place to protect the health of the health care workers who were treating this patient.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not clear exactly what protocols were in place and how those protocols were implemented, and the CDC wants to try to get to the bottom of that so that they can offer advice to medical professionals and hospital administrators and others across the country about the protocols that are needed to ensure that their health care workers remains safe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What the CDC is also doing, and they\xe2\x80\x99re expending significant resources to do this, is to do contact tracing of the two health care workers that have contracted the virus.\xc2\xa0 And that involves, as it sounds, tracing the contacts these individuals had after they got sick.\xc2\xa0 And so you saw the news release from CDC and from one of the domestic airlines today indicating that they were contacting passengers who were on the same flight as this individual to make sure that they are educated about the risk to which they were exposed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, what our medical experts tell us is that that risk is quite low.\xc2\xa0 But it is important for people to have access to that information so that they can get the facts about what sort of risk they\xe2\x80\x99re facing -- again, that risk is low -- and what steps should be taken if necessary in the unlikely event that they do start to display some symptoms.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday the President said that an Ebola epidemic in the United States is highly unlikely.\xc2\xa0 Is that statement still operative today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is true.\xc2\xa0 It\'s guided by the science.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what our experts say.\xc2\xa0 Our experts say that because the way that Ebola is transmitted is very clear and it is something that is not likely to happen in the United States.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s walk through what that is.\xc2\xa0 Ebola is not like the flu.\xc2\xa0 Ebola is not transmitted through the air.\xc2\xa0 Ebola is not transmitted though the food that we eat in this country and it\'s not transmitted through the water that we drink in this country.\xc2\xa0 The only way that an individual can get Ebola is by coming into close contact with the bodily fluids of an individual that is already exhibiting symptoms of Ebola.</p>\n<p>That\'s why, in this case, tragically, we\'ve seen two health care workers that obviously were in very close contact with the index Ebola patient contract this virus.\xc2\xa0 How exactly that transmission occurred is something that remains under investigation.\xc2\xa0 But the risk to which they were exposed was elevated by the fact that they were in close contact with this patient trying to meet that person\xe2\x80\x99s medical needs.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President used the word \xe2\x80\x9cepidemic.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Yesterday he used the word \xe2\x80\x9coutbreak\xe2\x80\x9d as something that\'s exceedingly -- chances are exceedingly low.\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t what we\'ve had in Dallas now an outbreak?\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had multiple transmissions.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there is a medical professional who could probably give you a specific definition of what actually constitutes an outbreak.\xc2\xa0 My layman\xe2\x80\x99s understanding that I think the vast majority of the American public would agree with is that we\'re talking about a situation in which two health care workers who were treating an individual with Ebola contracted the virus.\xc2\xa0 We are -- the CDC, our medical experts, are conducting an investigation to determine how that transmission occurred.\xc2\xa0 But that is different than images that are conjured up with an outbreak, where you have individuals who are basically in public transmitting the virus.\xc2\xa0 That is something that we think on a large scale is exceedingly unlikely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 WHO definition of an outbreak says that it\'s something that is an occurrence in excess of what normally would be expected in a defined community.\xc2\xa0 And it also can be the case where a disease has long been absent from a population.\xc2\xa0 That may also constitute an outbreak.\xc2\xa0 It really sounds like, even if it\'s not large-scale, it\'s an outbreak.\xc2\xa0 So I guess I wonder if that calls into question some of the reassurance that we\'ve heard in this room.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think it does, Mark, simply because what we\'re talking about here is a situation where there were health care workers who came into direct contact with an Ebola patient who did, tragically, contract the disease.\xc2\xa0 We are very focused on making sure that those individuals get the treatment that is necessary, and our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families as they fight this terrible virus.\xc2\xa0 But that is wholly different than, for example, the situation that we see in West Africa, where, tragically, you\'re seeing people who live in the same household be passing the virus from one to another, or we\'re seeing as the result of unsafe burial practices that individuals are contracting the virus from corpses.</p>\n<p>Again, that is a tragic occurrence.\xc2\xa0 It is an indication of the poor medical infrastructure that exists in those countries.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that poses a much broader risk to the population in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President has devoted significant resources from the federal government to combat that outbreak.\xc2\xa0 But that is obviously a far cry from the situation that exists in Dallas right now.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you said that the President still has confidence in the Director of the CDC.\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you a broader question.\xc2\xa0 You were pretty strong in defending the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s response to this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Now, given what we\'ve learned about another case in Dallas and the fact that that individual was able to -- did fly on a plane while she was supposed to be monitored, how would you -- would you still say that the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s response to this situation has been successful, has been up to the President\xe2\x80\x99s own standards?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll say a couple of things about that. The first is Dr. Frieden, the Director of the CDC, himself has said that it is unacceptable that even one health care worker was exposed to this virus while they were providing medical treatment to this patient.\xc2\xa0 So that is an indication that there were shortcomings, and that is something that is being thoroughly investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and other medical experts.</p>\n<p>That investigation obviously will also now expand to cover the second health care worker that has now been diagnosed with Ebola.\xc2\xa0 So that is a clear indication that -- well, let me say there is a second thing that Dr. Frieden also said, was that I believe it was earlier this week he noted that knowing what he knows now about the situation in the hospital, he indicated that he regretted not sending a team of experts to that hospital sooner to assist the hospital as they responded to this specific diagnosis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what you are seeing from the federal government, however, is the kind of tenacious response that reflects evolving circumstances.\xc2\xa0 So Dr. Frieden indicated that he would send a whole team of experts earlier this week after observing that he believed they should have been there sooner.\xc2\xa0 What you are seeing is after this diagnosis you are seeing stepped-up monitoring by health officials in Texas of other health care workers that were responsible for treating the index Ebola patient.\xc2\xa0 So this is a response that indicates a commitment to protect the health and safety of the American public.</p>\n<p>There are other ways in which this has happened as well.\xc2\xa0 We have adapted to circumstances by beefing up airport screenings, for example -- that at the end of last week, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that we announced new screening measures that would go into place at five airports across the country.\xc2\xa0 These are airports that cover essentially 95 percent of the arrivals of travelers that started out in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 Those improved or strengthened screening measures are indicative of our commitment to constantly evaluating our policies and, where possible, putting in place measures that would strengthen them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why do so many Americans feel, first of all, that there\xe2\x80\x99s a real risk of an epidemic in this country and that the federal government is not doing enough to stop it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, in the latest poll -- ABC-Washington Post -- two-thirds of Americans think the federal government is just not doing enough on this.\xc2\xa0 Are they wrong?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say this about that.\xc2\xa0 It sounds to me that a significant portion of the American population agrees with Dr. Frieden that even one transmission of the Ebola virus to one health care worker in this country is something that is unacceptable and something that won\'t be tolerated and something that has prompted a review of protocols and a careful investigation of how that transmission exactly occurred.</p>\n<p>What people can continue to be confident in is the priority attention that this issue is receiving across the federal government and here in the White House.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s evident by the fact that the President is convening some of the top-ranking officials in his administration to discuss that response.</p>\n<p>But again, what I would urge people to do -- I think the other thing that is motivating the answer to that question is something related to fear.\xc2\xa0 This is a deadly, terrible disease, and it is wreaking havoc in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s having a debilitating effect on the population there.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s genuinely tragic.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, because of the way that that virus is transmitted, because of the modern medical infrastructure that exists in this country, the risk of a similar outbreak like that in this country is exceedingly low.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what our medical experts tell us, and that is advice that we continue to follow.</p>\n<p>However, the administration continues to pursue the kind of tenacious response that will both protect the American public here at home, but also do what is necessary to completely eliminate the risk to the American public from the Ebola virus, and that\xe2\x80\x99s to stop this outbreak at the source.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just two quick ones.\xc2\xa0 Still no consideration of a travel ban from the affected countries in Africa?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that is not on the table at this point.\xc2\xa0 And again, the reason for that -- just in case people haven\'t heard the previous answer that I\xe2\x80\x99ve given to this question, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand exactly why that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.\xc2\xa0 Shutting down travel to that area of the world would prevent the expeditious flow of personnel and equipment into the region.\xc2\xa0 And the only way for us to stop this outbreak and to eliminate any risk from Ebola to the American public is to stop this outbreak at the source.</p>\n<p>So we are mobilizing significant resources to make sure that supplies and personnel can get to the affected region and start meeting the needs of the affected region to that we can stop the outbreak there.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why right now the travel ban is not on the table.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And the President cancelled political travel today, obviously, to do this meeting.\xc2\xa0 Does he plan to cancel further political travel?\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to continue his campaign schedule going forward despite the situation, or is this just kind of a one-day thing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, we\xe2\x80\x99ll evaluate it on a daily basis. This is obviously a dynamic situation.\xc2\xa0 If necessary, I have no doubt that the President will postpone his political travel to attend to important priorities here.\xc2\xa0 But whether a change in tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s schedule is required, we just don\xe2\x80\x99t know that yet, and when we do we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a couple of months ago, when the Malaysia Airlines jet was shot down over Ukraine, the President carried on with his campaign schedule.\xc2\xa0 A member of the staff said, \xe2\x80\x9cAbrupt changes to his [the President\xe2\x80\x99s] schedule can have the unintended consequence of unduly alarming the American people or creating a false sense of crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Did you do that today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, Major.\xc2\xa0 What drives these kinds of decisions are the President\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember if you traveled on that trip with us to Delaware and New York, but over the course of that trip I think the President called five different world leaders while he was on the road, including President Poroshenko, including the leader of Malaysia, including the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, who -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the nation that bore the brunt of that tragedy.\xc2\xa0 So the President was able to continue his schedule, that it did include some public -- that did include some political events, while also tending to his responsibilities as the Commander-in-Chief.</p>\n<p>As it relates to today\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, the schedule did need to be changed so that the President could fulfill his responsibilities as the leader of the country.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll evaluate the schedule tomorrow based on his requirements, and if we need to make a change to his schedule so that he can do what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary here at the White House, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll change his schedule.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet whether that will be required.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting a decision meeting?\xc2\xa0 You had indicated at the top of your remarks that some decisions may very well be announced by the President.\xc2\xa0 Is that what makes this of such signature importance that he had to cancel the travel plans?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, again, the reason that this meeting is important is because we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the senior members of his team who are responsible for dealing with what is a pretty urgent situation here in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But will there be new decisions or new methods announced after this meeting.\xc2\xa0 Is this meeting --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Frankly, Major, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 But if there are, the President will have the opportunity to discuss them with all of you at the conclusion of the meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have there been additional meetings that the President or his senior staff have convened here in the last three or four days on Ebola that have not appeared on the public schedule?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has frequently been updated and briefed on this issue.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there have been any other formal meetings that have been convened, but I know that there have been a number of occasions in which the President has been updated on this situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Jon\xe2\x80\x99s line of question, can you understand that the public watching this story play out can have a genuine sense of either skepticism or possibly alarm because they hear, \xe2\x80\x9cwe know how to deal with this; we are taking all the proper steps; all the precautions are being implemented,\xe2\x80\x9d and then yet someone who has it, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show symptoms, gets on a commercial aircraft, even though the exposure risk is minimal, everyone on that plane has now been in contact.\xc2\xa0 That creates at least a low level sense of alarm by everyone that was on that plane, everyone who knows a person on that plane, and everyone who remembers hearing just a couple of days ago, \xe2\x80\x9cwell, that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got this under control.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you understand how the public is becoming less confident and possibly more alarmed as the story plays out?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 People should continue to be confident in the response that was organized by the government in reaction to this specific situation.\xc2\xa0 The reason for that is simply that we have a modern medical infrastructure in place that, again, has not been flawless -- we pointed out why that was the case, that even one transmission to a health care worker is unacceptable -- people should take solace in the fact that, quite frankly, we know exactly how Ebola is transmitted.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not transmitted through the air, it\xe2\x80\x99s not transmitted through food or water, but only through close contact with the bodily fluids of an individual that have symptoms of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 But this is a deadly, graphic disease.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Dr. Frieden said this person should not have traveled.\xc2\xa0 That was a big mistake.\xc2\xa0 That looks to me, and I think it looks to most people evaluating this fairly, as sort of a gap in the system, that something that should have been communicated very tightly within the Texas Presbyterian community, hey, don\xe2\x80\x99t get on a commercial aircraft, happened anyway.\xc2\xa0 Do you understand how that can create some degree of uncertainty among the public when trying to evaluate where the story is going and how tightly you have your arms wrapped around this situation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Major, I can certainly understand the concern by the American public about this terrible disease.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a deadly disease.\xc2\xa0 But it is a disease that we know -- whose outbreak we know how to contain here in this country.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on -- from trying to meet the needs of the health care workers who have contracted the virus, to investigating how exactly that virus transmission occurred, to doing the necessary contact tracing to ensure that other individuals who may have come in contact with somebody who had the Ebola virus are aware of the risk that they face and are monitoring their own health.</p>\n<p>Active monitoring has now been expanded to include all of the health care workers that came in contact with the index Ebola patient in this hospital in Dallas.\xc2\xa0 So there are a number of steps that we have taken, and I think that people can be encouraged that the federal government is demonstrating the kind of tenacious, adaptive response that\xe2\x80\x99s required to dealing with what is understandably a pretty concerning situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess my last question is, does the President want his response team to be more tenacious and more urgent, so stories and situations like this stop happening?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the President himself certainly feels a very strong sense of urgency about ensuring that his administration and the medical experts are mobilizing the kind of response that will ensure the safety and health of the broader American public.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President expects.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people expect.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that will be discussed at today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting.</p>\n<p>Olivier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the President spoke today with the leaders of Japan, the U.K., France, Germany and Italy.\xc2\xa0 Ebola was part of the conversation in each of these conversations --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to interrupt you.\xc2\xa0 The conversation with the Prime Minister of Japan was separate from the conversations with the other leaders.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to imply they were all together. But he spoke to those leaders either together or separately, or however you want to put it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been intense interest in the modality with which the President communicates with world leaders since the very first day I did this briefing, so I\xe2\x80\x99m cognizant of the importance of those kinds of details.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I respect that and I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 The President has said repeatedly now that he\xe2\x80\x99s not satisfied with the global response in terms of stemming Ebola at the source.\xc2\xa0 So my question for you regarding these various conversations is whether he made any specific asks of these world leaders, or whether he is satisfied that they have fully stepped up to their responsibilities.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say two things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, more than a month ago -- or I guess it was about a month ago -- the President made an announcement at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta that he was going to make a significant commitment of Department of Defense resources in Western Africa to put in place the logistical infrastructure that was needed to ramp up our response to the Ebola outbreak in that region of the world.\xc2\xa0 That continues to be a priority for his administration.</p>\n<p>The President is receiving regular updates from the Department of Defense about their ongoing efforts to put in place that logistical capability.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense has tremendous expertise in this area.\xc2\xa0 And the reaction to that commitment has been an increase in resources and personnel that are being supplied by non-governmental organizations and from governments around the world.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve been heartened by that response, and that is an indication of just how important it is for the United States to show leadership in a crisis situation like this.</p>\n<p>Now, that said -- that all being said, the President does believe that we need to see more from the international community; that we have not seen a sufficient commitment of resources and personnel from other countries to dealing with this urgent situation in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 The stakes are high, and impact on the local population there is tragic.\xc2\xa0 And we need to see a more significant commitment of resources from countries around the world to dealing with this effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the risk of restating my question, did he make any specific asks of the world leaders today?\xc2\xa0 Or is he satisfied that the countries involved have met that challenge?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a more detailed readout of the secure video teleconference that the President conducted today with those European leaders.\xc2\xa0 But as a general matter, I can tell you that the President did urge those world leaders to commit to make a more significant commitment to dealing with the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to circle back on the question about why the President is staying here in town today.\xc2\xa0 I know that you said it was necessary to respond to the outbreak, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why that is, especially since not only with the Malaysia Airline plane that went down, but everything from Ferguson to Egypt to the Fort Hood shooting, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President either maintain his political schedule or is vacation schedule.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Each of these situations we consider on a case-by-case basis, as you would expect.\xc2\xa0 In this situation, the President felt it was important to convene a meeting of the senior members of his administration who are responsible for responding to this particular incident.\xc2\xa0 And so the President is convening that meeting this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 And because of the meeting was this afternoon, the President had to postpone the political travel that he had already planned.\xc2\xa0 We do anticipate that the President will be able to reschedule this trip in advance of Election Day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the reason that I ask -- I mean, presumably, Air Force One has got a phone, a video conference; he could do it while he was traveling, as he did in these other instances.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re three weeks out in the midterm elections and this is obviously a story that\xe2\x80\x99s come to dominate headlines.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if this was made out of any sort of political consideration.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, generally, I guess, can you evaluate how you guys see this politically?\xc2\xa0 I know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly that politics don\xe2\x80\x99t come into your decision of how to respond to the crisis, but obviously this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s dominated every question of this briefing, and we\xe2\x80\x99re in a political time.\xc2\xa0 so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how you guys see this playing into the midterm election.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, to be candid with you, Justin, I try to consider my words carefully when I speak up here, and the fact is I haven\'t given any thought to the political consequences of this response.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you not thought at all about the politics?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a very busy day here that\xe2\x80\x99s been focused on making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re mobilizing an appropriate response to this urgent situation.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are many people who have considered the political ramifications of this response and of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision to alter the schedule.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t crossed the minds of the President\xe2\x80\x99s senior advisors here at the White House.</p>\n<p>Move around.\xc2\xa0 Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, Dr. Frieden said today that, going forward, the CDC would make sure that people who are at risk of having been exposed would not be getting on commercial airliners.\xc2\xa0 But when he was pressed on the authority for that, he said just that the CDC work with state and local officials.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, does the White House feel like that authority is clear, or do you need some extra powers?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, in terms of the powers that are necessary, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you back to the CDC.\xc2\xa0 They are the ones who are principally responsible for monitoring the health and, therefore, the movements of these individuals.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them for what they feel is necessary for them to do that successfully.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds a little vague.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it sounds like, well, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to trust that the folks in Dallas are going to, and folks in Ohio are going to keep these folks off airplanes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Scott, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the CDC that\xe2\x80\x99s principally responsible for this.\xc2\xa0 Let me just take this opportunity to remind you and everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s watching that the risk that has been presented to those individuals who are on the airplane with the second health care worker earlier this week do not face a significant risk here.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the risk is, according to our medical professionals, rather low.</p>\n<p>But what we will do, because of our -- as is guided by the tenacious response that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, is contact these individuals, encourage them to contact the CDC to make sure that they are properly educated about the risk that they do face.\xc2\xa0 And in the unlikely event that any sort of health concerns should arise, that they have the available information about what they should do in response to that.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I want to follow up Jon and Major a little bit.\xc2\xa0 There are crises that happen that are instantaneous, that the response then sort of starts on that day or that moment that the crisis happens -- an earthquake or a terrorist attack.\xc2\xa0 This is not one of those, right?\xc2\xa0 The presence of Ebola in the United States, starting with the first patient and proceeding through the other two, was something that was -- that could have been anticipated easily in the weeks and months before, as the Ebola situation in West Africa was playing out.</p>\n<p>And so when you talk about the \xe2\x80\x9ctenacious response,\xe2\x80\x9d I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President is angry, if you guys are frustrated, if there is a level of upset at the fact that each time another kind of moment in this crisis has played out since Ebola arrived here in the United States, the CDC has responded to it, but hasn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipated it.</p>\n<p>So the issue of flights of medical personnel, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that have been talked about in meetings six weeks ago, and determined that what the policy of the CDC is going to be is that medical workers that might be infected by a patient are not going to be allowed to travel?\xc2\xa0 Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that have been decided long before it ever arrived here?\xc2\xa0 Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t issues of transportation of materials or -- I mean, all the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through, you\xe2\x80\x99ve described being satisfied with the tenacious response after the things happened, but is that good enough for the President that these things weren\xe2\x80\x99t anticipated and figured out ahead of time?</p>\n<p>And is he frustrated that these scientists have repeatedly told him and you and the other people in this building, \xe2\x80\x9cwe got this, we got it under control,\xe2\x80\x9d and then something happens and they say, \xe2\x80\x9cokay, well, now we\xe2\x80\x99ve got in under control;,now we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do something to respond to the thing that we now see is the case\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 I mean, all this feels like they should have anticipated this before, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say it -- there are a variety of ways I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to think I can answer your question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was a long question, I apologize.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s an understandable one, so let me try to answer it in a couple of ways.\xc2\xa0 The first is, there are a number of things that the President is concerned about.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a deadly disease, and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about now two American health care workers who have contracted this disease in this country.\xc2\xa0 Now, they have done that when they were treating a patient with Ebola that had originally contracted the disease in West Africa, so the circumstances are important.\xc2\xa0 But yet the concern that the President has exists nonetheless.</p>\n<p>The President is also concerned about making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring the health of the other health care workers who came into close contact with this individual patient, the index patient, as he\xe2\x80\x99s often described.</p>\n<p>What the CDC is also doing, and what the President is concerned about, is making sure that we do all the necessary contact tracing, particularly as it relates to those individuals who were also passengers on the plane from Cleveland to Dallas.\xc2\xa0 That is -- again, the risk to those passengers is low, but the President and everyone in the administration believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for that contact tracing to take place.</p>\n<p>The other thing the President is concerned about and focused on is making sure that health care professionals across the country are getting clear guidance from the Centers for Disease Control about what protocols they should put in place.\xc2\xa0 He wants to make sure that those health care professionals are appropriately aware of the need to be cognizant of the fact that</p>\n<p>He wants to make sure that those health care professionals are appropriately aware of the need to be cognizant of the fact that there could be other Ebola patients that present themselves for treatment at health care facilities across the country.\xc2\xa0 He wants to make sure the health care professionals are getting guidance about how to handle that individual when they present themselves, how to diagnose Ebola, and then what protocol should be put in place from there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that clear communication is something that the President is very focused on.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for you to describe the President as very concerned about this situation.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President is urgently convening this meeting this afternoon to make sure that the response is commensurate with the level of concern that he feels.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to point out that there are a number of health care workers who were Americans who were conducting relief missions in West Africa who tragically contracted this virus who were then safely flown back to the United States, were treated in medical facilities in the United States, recovered from that illness, based on the sound medical treatment that they received in this country.\xc2\xa0 And to date, we do not yet know of any situations where a health care worker who was treating those individuals contracted the virus.</p>\n<p>So the Director of the CDC has already indicated his concern that more experts were not deployed sooner to Dallas to help them deal with this Ebola diagnosis in their hospital.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is that there are multiple other patients who have been treated and recovered from the disease at other facilities in the United States where those health care workers, at least as far as we know now, weren\xe2\x80\x99t put at risk of catching Ebola themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there have been situations where the response and treatment of patients has been consistent with the expectations of the President and with the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that that treatment was rendered in a way that did not ultimately pose a risk to those health care workers contracting Ebola I think is an indication that what our medical experts tell us about having the necessary knowledge to treat Ebola is correct.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we need to make sure that the necessary protocols are in place so that when -- and again, our medical experts tell us this too, there are likely to be more cases of Ebola -- what the President and what our administration is focused on is making sure that when those cases present themselves, that those patients get the treatment that they need to recover, that those patients can be treated in a way that doesn\'t put health care workers at a significantly elevated level of risk, and that we can ensure the safety of the broader public.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s hard work.</p>\n<p>Dr. Frieden himself has said that fighting Ebola is hard.\xc2\xa0 But if you consider the wide range of the government\xe2\x80\x99s response, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of reason for people to feel confident about what we\'re doing.\xc2\xa0 But there is a reason that the President and people all across the country are concerned about this deadly disease.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to make sure that we\'re mobilizing the kind of response that is up to the expectations not just of the President but of the people he serves.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one real quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 I promise I won\xe2\x80\x99t be long.\xc2\xa0 So is there a fear that by expressing that concern as criticism of CDC or of the government itself, that that undermines the need to keep public confidence high and not cause a panic?\xc2\xa0 Is that why the concern is not expressed as a criticism of the response so far?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what you\xe2\x80\x99ve -- what\xe2\x80\x99s evident I think from this President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership style is that he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on solving problems, that pointing fingers of blame will not be constructive here.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President is focused on results.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President is convening the meeting today with his team who is responsible for responding to this situation.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, getting back to Lisa Monaco.\xc2\xa0 You said she\xe2\x80\x99s overseeing the federal response on Ebola --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I hate to be nitpicky here, but what she\xe2\x80\x99s really doing is she\xe2\x80\x99s coordinating the activities of all the government agencies who are themselves responsible for responding to specific areas of their own expertise.\xc2\xa0 So she\xe2\x80\x99s not overseeing --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So who\xe2\x80\x99s in charge?\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s in charge?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s not overseeing the construction of Ebola transmission units in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense is responsible for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that, but who is in charge of --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s not responsible for coordinating --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- who is in charge of the overall response?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s not responsible for coordinating the activities of the international community as they interact with local governments in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 USAID is involved in that effort.\xc2\xa0 They have an area of expertise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You understand my question --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s not diagnosing people in the field.\xc2\xa0 So the point is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I get you\'re interrupting me because you feel like you have a point to make.\xc2\xa0 But you understand my question.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the point that I have to make is directly relevant --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You seem to be reluctant to say who\xe2\x80\x99s in charge of the federal response to Ebola.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I think that I\xe2\x80\x99m reciting very clearly to you who specifically is responsible for which activities when it comes to this government\xe2\x80\x99s tenacious response to Ebola.\xc2\xa0 And that is the Department of Defense who is responsible for putting in place the logistical capacity in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 That\'s USAID that\'s trying to meet the needs of communities in West Africa so that we can stop this outbreak at the source.\xc2\xa0 We see CDC lending their expertise to West Africa to help local governments mobilize the resources that they need to stop this outbreak.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Department of Homeland Security play their role in ensuring the safety of the American public, whether that\'s people traveling across the globe, or individuals who are attempting to enter this country.\xc2\xa0 You have the responsibility of HHS and CDC who are responsible for working with hospitals and doctors all across the country to treat Ebola patients if they materialize at their medical facilities.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not one person in charge?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that there are individuals who are --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or is that the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are individuals who are directly responsible for their line of responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And you have an individual here at the White House who is responsible for coordinating the actions of those government agencies to make sure that they are properly integrated.\xc2\xa0 I think that is a completely reasonable management structure.\xc2\xa0 And if it is determined that additional resources are needed to manage this response, then we won\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to add them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The only reason why I ask is because Lisa Monaco is also the Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Advisor.\xc2\xa0 With the threat posed by ISIS and various other terrorist groups around the world, it seems like she has a lot on her plate right now.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 She does have a lot on her plate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She can do that and Ebola?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 She is a highly capable individual who can fulfill her responsibilities in terms of coordinating the government\xe2\x80\x99s response, the government agencies\xe2\x80\x99 response to this Ebola situation, while at the same time ensuring that she is playing the role that she plays in protecting our homeland.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Dr. Frieden, I mean he mentioned yesterday he said he wished he had done this sooner with the special teams that go in and supervise the treatment.\xc2\xa0 Today he said that this second patient is going to be transferred to the Emory Ebola experts.\xc2\xa0 That suggests that that precautionary step of having teams in place to supervise care may not be enough.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that what the CDC is recommending right now is a crystal-clear set of protocols when it comes to dealing with Ebola patients?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are experts from the CDC who are on the ground in Dallas who are doing a variety of things.\xc2\xa0 One is they\'re offering some expertise about the treatment of those Ebola patients that are currently under the care of Texas Presbyterian Hospital.\xc2\xa0 You also have experts from the CDC who are nurses who are doing some peer-to-peer training when it comes to the use of personal protective equipment.\xc2\xa0 You have experts in infection control and experts in dealing with the Ebola virus itself who are advising hospital administrators and doctors there about treating these individual patients.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You have CDC experts who are responsible for doing the contact tracing that is necessary, not just of the index patient himself and his family who he spent some time with before he was admitted to the hospital, but also doing the contact tracing that is related to the two health care workers that contracted the virus.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a pretty work-intensive effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The administration said these patients can be treated in hospitals.\xc2\xa0 Now the second patient is going to Emory.\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t there an inconsistency there?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I think what you\'re seeing is you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing an adaptation in terms of the government\xe2\x80\x99s response.\xc2\xa0 I just talked earlier about how the facility at Emory had successfully treated other health care workers who contracted the virus in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 Those individuals were treated.\xc2\xa0 They recovered and were released.\xc2\xa0 And that treatment was rendered without the health care workers themselves contracting the Ebola virus.\xc2\xa0 So that may be an indication that they have expertise that can be used and dedicated to this specific case.</p>\n<p>But again, the treatment of these individuals is going to be guided by our medical experts and by the science.\xc2\xa0 I guess if you have additional questions about that I\'d encourage you to reach out to CDC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that there were shortcomings and flaws with the response.\xc2\xa0 You acknowledge that.\xc2\xa0 Did the President register his frustration --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I acknowledged is something that our medical experts themselves have acknowledged.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You acknowledge that medical experts said that there are shortcomings and flaws.\xc2\xa0 Did the President tell Dr. Frieden he\xe2\x80\x99s dissatisfied with that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\'s fair for you to assume that the President shares the view that the transmission of the Ebola virus to even one health care worker is something that is not acceptable.\xc2\xa0 The President does share that view.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you said you have confidence in Dr. Frieden.\xc2\xa0 On the question of who is in charge, we notice on the morning television today it was not Dr. Frieden, it was Sylvia Burwell at HHS -- not Lisa Monaco.\xc2\xa0 And then the conference call that happened about an hour or so ago with Dr. Frieden, at the last minute it was, well, it\'s not going to be on camera with him anymore.\xc2\xa0 Sylvia Burwell at HHS is going to be on the call with him and she\xe2\x80\x99s going to start it off.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that suggest that now she\xe2\x80\x99s taking on a more hands-on role and yet another personm is involved at the top?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, Ed, a couple of times I\xe2\x80\x99ve described the important role that HHS has to play in terms of protecting the American public here at home and communicating with public health officials across the country at the state and local level and also communicating with doctors and nurses, health care providers and hospital administrators.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s been an important role for HHS to play in this response from the beginning; they have played that role.\xc2\xa0 And the Secretary of Health and Human Services has been actively engaged from the beginning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so the CDC today is saying it was improper for the health care worker to fly from Cleveland to Dallas Fort Worth.\xc2\xa0 Why is it still appropriate for the U.S. to allow people to fly into America from the hot zone?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Quite simply, Ed, because there are -- there is a multilayered screening protocol that\xe2\x80\x99s in place to ensure that individuals that may have symptoms consistent with Ebola are not even able to board planes in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, dozens of people have been denied boarding over the last few months because they are exhibiting symptoms consistent with Ebola.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s also a screening that\xe2\x80\x99s in place on international flights to ensure that our flight crews are aware of what they should be looking for in terms of people exhibiting symptoms of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 And then there is also a layered screening -- a screening layer here in this country where we have CBP officers who are responsible for observing people who are reentering the country and subjecting those who have traveled in West Africa to additional screening to make sure that those individuals aren\xe2\x80\x99t symptomatic.</p>\n<p>Obviously, that multilayered screening approach does is not in place for domestic flights.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the difference.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if you can address nurses unions and just nurses around the country who are expressing alarm not just at health care workers being exposed, but they say that Mr. Duncan was in an emergency room at this hospital in Dallas for hours in an area with not just health care workers but citizens sitting there, and that waste -- once he was admitted in, waste was piling up.\xc2\xa0 The nurses were around this waste.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the White House about that and how many more people could have been exposed, and why that just was not handled properly?\xc2\xa0 He was sitting in an open area for hours.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, but again, Ed, the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand is to understand how the Ebola virus is transmitted.\xc2\xa0 The Ebola virus is not transmitted through the air, so people who breathe the same air as this individual when he was --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- come into contact with him when he\xe2\x80\x99s in a public area and has Ebola.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, they have to come in contact with his bodily fluids in order to contract Ebola.\xc2\xa0 There are very clear guidelines for how this disease is contracted.\xc2\xa0 Now, that all being said, it\xe2\x80\x99s the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to communicate clearly with hospitals and health care facilities across the country about the proper protocol for evaluating individuals that may have symptoms consistent with Ebola and for isolating those individuals that need to be isolated based on their travel history.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s also a protocol that the CDC has in place for rendering treatment to those individuals who have been diagnosed, who have tested positive for Ebola.\xc2\xa0 The CDC is reviewing those protocols.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re constantly assessing and reassessing those protocols.\xc2\xa0 And I mentioned earlier that one of the things that we are concerned about is making sure that the CDC is offering clear guidance to health care professionals across the country about what those protocols should be and how those protocols should be implemented.\xc2\xa0 And that continues to be a priority and it continues to be something that the President is worried about.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s evident in this particular situation in Dallas that there was -- that something unacceptable occurred; that we saw a health care worker contract the Ebola virus after treating somebody that had Ebola.\xc2\xa0 So there are some protocol changes that are being reviewed by CDC, and when those changes are determined to be necessary, CDC will make those announcements and communicate them clearly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other topic so others can go.\xc2\xa0 The New York Times has a story about American troops being exposed to chemical weapons in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 I know that exposure, at least most of it, appears to have happened during the Bush administration, but the story is alleging that the Pentagon kept this secret from troops, from veterans, continuing into the Obama administration.\xc2\xa0 So I wanted you to address when President Obama was briefed on this first, and why this administration appears to have continued to keep this secret.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed, let me say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reporting about U.S. military personnel and Iraqi exposure to chemicals related to Saddam Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s weapons of mass destruction programs.\xc2\xa0 Needless to say, we have the deepest concerns for these individuals.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense has indicated that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to conduct a review of this specific situation.** There\xe2\x80\x99s a full statement that I won\xe2\x80\x99t read from here, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense to get a better understanding of exactly how we\xe2\x80\x99re responding to this particular situation.</p>\n<p>I know that Secretary Hagel, who himself is a combat veteran and somebody who was wounded in combat while serving his country, so he obviously takes these kinds of issues very personally, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that they will conduct the kind of detailed review that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.**</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting is starting.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Kristin, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one and then I\xe2\x80\x99d better run.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Does this underscore the need for a surgeon general to be installed?\xc2\xa0 And who should the American people be listening to right now?\xc2\xa0 And talk about the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from a number of different people and I think there is a confusion -- obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get at the idea of who is in charge, but who should people be listening to right now?\xc2\xa0 President Obama is not out here answering our questions.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a number of medical experts talk about the necessary protocols, about the low risk that faces the American public right now.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President on a number of occasions talk about the need for a robust response in West Africa to deal with this outbreak at the source.\xc2\xa0 So there are a number of administration officials who have been talking about this publicly.\xc2\xa0 All of them are talking based on the guidance of our medical professionals.\xc2\xa0 They are all talking about how our response reflects our commitment to the safety and security of the American public, and how those principles are guided by the science.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the buck stops with the President, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No doubt.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s always true.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s always true.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to run to this other meeting.\xc2\xa0 Send me an e-mail and I\xe2\x80\x99ll see what I can do to get you an answer.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t3:25 P.M.
