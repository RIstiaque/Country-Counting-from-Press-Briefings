EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Make sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t have my devices here.\xc2\xa0 Good.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the White House.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming to the daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I just wanted to anticipate one in particular and say that the breaking news report that you all have probably received is incorrect.\xc2\xa0 There is no deal.\xc2\xa0 We are not close to a deal.\xc2\xa0 We are -- obviously the President is in discussions with all the leaders of Congress, as well as other members, and exploring the possibility of getting the biggest deal possible, which is a position he has held for a long time now, as you know.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact is that there is no progress to report, but we continue to work on getting the most significant deficit reduction package possible, because we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing for the economy and that done in the right way, in a balanced way, it will be good for growth and good for job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Filing break?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You guys just tweeted it, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that how it works?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll start -- Ben.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there meetings today -- before you start, Ben.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can say that I have nothing to announce in terms of scheduled meetings.\xc2\xa0 As you know, this is a fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday I was able to announce a meeting, and then once another one had been scheduled was able to follow up with another announcement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So right now we have nothing scheduled.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that discussions are ongoing over the phone, in person, with a variety of different participants, including obviously the President, the Vice President and others.\xc2\xa0 And that will continue.\xc2\xa0 And when we have an announcement to make in terms of potential meetings, I will be sure to announce and make that announcement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Ben.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you said you\xe2\x80\x99re not close to a deal, and you also said there\xe2\x80\x99s no progress to report.\xc2\xa0 Did yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meetings yield any progress?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, they were constructive and useful meetings.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re not reading out in any detail the contents of the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 But they were constructive and useful.\xc2\xa0 And we are going through the process of examining what\xe2\x80\x99s possible, what we can get, what can be done in a balanced way to achieve significant deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is not in doubt is that Congress will act to ensure that the debt ceiling is raised and that we do not risk default.\xc2\xa0 That is not in doubt.\xc2\xa0 The only issue under discussion and debate right now is what kind of deficit reduction package can accompany a measure that would ensure that we do not, for the first time in our long history, default on our obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it still a red line for the President that any grand deal include revenues?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it is absolutely essential that any grand bargain, if you will, any significantly sized deficit reduction package be balanced; that it contain -- that it address all the drivers of our long-term debt and our significant deficits, and that includes non-defense discretionary spending, which, as you know, is only 12 percent of our budget but we can make significant reductions there.\xc2\xa0 We can make cuts that represent very tough choices in many ways for Democrats; we should do that.\xc2\xa0 We can find savings in defense spending, and we must, and we can do that and we can find significant savings in defense spending and do it in a prudent way that ensures that we maintain our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We can find savings through the reform of our entitlement programs and -- reforms that strengthen those programs for the future and for future generations, make sure that those vital, vital programs are strong and providing services to not just this generation of seniors but to generations into the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, we can and must, if we want to achieve significant deficit reduction, find savings through the tax code.\xc2\xa0 We have to close loopholes, unnecessary subsidies to industries.\xc2\xa0 We have to address the fact that if we are asking for some belt tightening and sacrifice from average Americans, from the middle class, we have to also insist that the most fortunate among us also contribute to this.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way to do it.\xc2\xa0 And if we do it that way, in a balanced way, then the kinds of things we need to do will not be draconian and will not be overly burdensome on any sector of society.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as you figure out what\xe2\x80\x99s possible here, is it still the President\xe2\x80\x99s position that any expansion of the debt limit must take the country through 2012?\xc2\xa0 Or would he be willing to accept something less than that, maybe --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, let me be clear.\xc2\xa0 And I think there was some unfortunate reporting on this yesterday, or at least some unfortunate headlines.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position, his opposition to a short-term extension, a short-term lifting of the debt ceiling remains firm, period.\xc2\xa0 He is opposed.\xc2\xa0 He is against it, because it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the economy.\xc2\xa0 It only furthers the uncertainty that is already a drag on the economy, the doubt about whether or not Washington can get its act together, right, and whether or not Washington can be -- ensure that the United States remains the fundamental safe haven in the world in terms of investment.\xc2\xa0 So he is fundamentally opposed to that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I said yesterday and what I then clarified in time for everybody\xe2\x80\x99s deadlines here is that all I was expressing an openness to was if there is a deal and that deal is in place and agreed upon, and because of the way Congress works and the need to cross t\xe2\x80\x99s and dot i\xe2\x80\x99s, we need to extend for a few days, we\xe2\x80\x99d be open to that -- if there is a deal.\xc2\xa0 That is a long way from the kind of six-month, nine-month, one-year extensions, short-term extensions that have been discussed in which the President is unalterably opposed to.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, well, your last sentence there gets more to what I was asking about.\xc2\xa0 I understand what you did yesterday --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, opposed, against.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But his premise has been that a grand deal should take the country through 2012 on the debt limit.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that stands?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 His premise is that we have to raise the debt ceiling for an extended period of time into 2013 regardless.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not attached to the grand bargain or a significant deficit reduction deal.\xc2\xa0 That is what we have to do for economic -- to create the kind of economic certainty that is essential to allow us to reach our potential in terms of growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 So his position on that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About 85 House Republicans have signed a letter opposing the McConnell-Reid contingency plan.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if you can respond to that and say whether it remains a viable option.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, what we know -- whatever it\xe2\x80\x99s called -- is that whatever the vehicle is to do this that Congress will act responsibly and ensure that the United States does not for the first time in its history risk default; that the United States will continue to be able to borrow money in order to pay the bills that it ran up in the past.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 What it\xe2\x80\x99s called I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you.\xc2\xa0 What the name on the bill will be, I cannot predict at this time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that it is likely that no matter what we do here -- because these are hard votes, we understand that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to be done in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 I can predict with great confidence that whatever we pass will not pass unanimously and that whatever we pass will be voted -- that there will be some Republicans and some Democrats who will vote no.\xc2\xa0 I think that is likely.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of these kinds of debates and these kinds of issues.\xc2\xa0 But we remain absolutely confident that the United States will not for the first time default on its obligations or risk default on its obligations, that Congress will act appropriately.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said that July 22nd is the date by which he\xe2\x80\x99d like to see a deal.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Actually, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of confusion about that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President said that.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of expression of this mythical deadline, which was expressed, as I understand it, as a walk back from August 2nd, which is a firm deadline established by the green-eyeshade folks over at Treasury in terms of when we no longer have the authority to borrow money, walking back, looking at what it takes for Congress to take action.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is up to Congress to decide how many days they need to take action.\xc2\xa0 So there is not -- which is not to say that we have the luxury of a great amount of time, but there is no July 22nd deadline.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to be clear about that on numerous occasions from here.\xc2\xa0 We are clearly under the gun here.\xc2\xa0 The clock is ticking.\xc2\xa0 That is why there is so much going on -- negotiations, conversations, discussions, et cetera.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But let me be clear about that, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- something magical doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen on the 22nd.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that members of the administration, the President, everybody will be working full-time to make sure that we achieve the most significant deficit reduction possible.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a date by which he does think there needs to be a deal to get this done?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- I just want to be clear.\xc2\xa0 This is about how the sausage gets made in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s really -- I would rely more -- I would place more confidence in the estimates that the leaders in the House and the Senate give you about how long it would take for this process to work.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we do know is we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of time if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get something significant done by the August 2nd deadline, which we believe there is time for that to happen.\xc2\xa0 And, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for everyone to understand that what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here is the deficit reduction package that would be accompanying the move -- the measure to raise the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, quickly on another topic.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Grover Norquist wrote today that -- in answer to a question in The Washington Post -- that allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire would not, in his view, be raising taxes.\xc2\xa0 That seems to be a sea change position.\xc2\xa0 And now Speaker Boehner, when asked the same question, says he disagrees; that would constitute raising taxes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I saw that Grover, whom I\xe2\x80\x99ve known for a long time, has reverted to absolutism himself and said that, in fact, the position that was expressed in the newspaper is not accurate.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s regrettable, because I think that the fact is that the wealthiest Americans have had a good decade compared to the rest of the country.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s terrific.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The problem is that the middle class, long before the recession hit, was seeing itself squeezed -- incomes flat or near flat and a lot of prices rising.\xc2\xa0 And we have -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why this President since he came into office has acted to reduce taxes for the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he continues to believe that it is -- in an environment like this, it is incumbent upon everyone to help the country tighten its belt.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the Bush high-income tax cuts absolutely have to expire and go back to the rates, by the way, where they were during the longest peacetime expansion in history, the period of greatest economic growth, job creation in American history, in the 1990s.\xc2\xa0 So he thinks that\xe2\x80\x99s an entirely reasonable and fair position to take.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President a few weeks ago said in negotiations that he hoped that everybody would leave their ultimatums at the door.\xc2\xa0 I count four ultimatums and they were -- all four of them were brought in, two of them are the President\xe2\x80\x99s and two of them are the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans\xe2\x80\x99, obviously, is no tax increases and it has to be a dollar for dollar raising the debt ceiling versus deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s are, this has to go through 2013, as Ben asked about, and that it has to have tax increases.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain to the American people why the ultimatum that this has to go through 2013 is important?\xc2\xa0 Because you and I talked about this, and I still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why that ultimatum is more important than avoiding the risk of default?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to default, Jake.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a circular question.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- Congress will act and has said that it will act, and we remain confident that it will.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important not to have a short-term extension, because since Congress will act and raise the debt ceiling and ensure that the United States is able to pay its bills, that we do that for a period through 2012 into 2013, so that we do not contribute to the kind of uncertainty that many economists feel has been a drag on our economic growth and our job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it is a position I think that is eminently sensible, eminently defensible.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that -- and we know that Congress will act to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in a world where you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for the lesser of evils, the least horrible option, is contributing to that uncertainty not preferable to risking a default --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re asking for a hypothetical that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to default.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Saying it does not make it so.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 True enough.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would that it were.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But the issue is not just that I\xe2\x80\x99m saying it or the President is saying it, it\xe2\x80\x99s that the leaders of the House and Senate are saying it, and they\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who have to vote on it.\xc2\xa0 So we remain absolutely confident that the debt ceiling will be raised, that the United States will continue to be able to pay its bills, including obviously the debt -- pay the holders of our debt and our treasuries, our beneficiaries of Social Security and veterans\xe2\x80\x99 benefits, et cetera, et cetera; that that will not -- that that is not an issue here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The issue is a debate and a discussion and a negotiation with members of Congress over what kind of deficit reduction package we can get as part of this process.\xc2\xa0 And the President remains optimistic that we can get something significant.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we saw -- we have seen -- Mr. Norquist notwithstanding, we have seen a significant amount of movement in terms of both public opinion and Republican opinion about the need to take a balanced approach, the wisdom behind the idea that we need to have a balanced approach to it if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have significant deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we hope that that growing support creates some momentum and that we can do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just as a quick aside --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I want to move -- remember, I said yesterday that I regretted not getting further back.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, please go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you got a quick one, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it seems like the White House has been relatively quiet on the subject of Syria as of late and I was wondering if you had any comment on recent developments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Simply that -- I mean, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I mean, not since the last time I addressed this.\xc2\xa0 We continue to condemn the violence.\xc2\xa0 We believe that President Assad has lost his legitimacy.\xc2\xa0 He had the opportunity to lead the transition that the Syrian people are demanding, and he has not followed up or taken that opportunity.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s regrettable, because there will be -- there has to be a transition.\xc2\xa0 The Syrian people are demanding that there be one.\xc2\xa0 And --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you guys are doing?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything the White House or the State Department are attempting to do to effect that transition?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the Syrian people to do that.\xc2\xa0 We have, as you know --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re being killed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- instituted a lot of sanctions, working unilaterally and multilaterally with our international partners.\xc2\xa0 And obviously our ambassador there has gone to Hama and been with the people there who are among those protesting the kind of treatment they\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting from the Syrian regime.\xc2\xa0 And we continue obviously to monitor the situation there very closely.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to work through here.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, so there is a grand bargain worth about $4 trillion that\xe2\x80\x99s back on the table?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Norah, the $4 trillion, or between $3 trillion and $4 trillion big deal, has been on the table, oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, for a long time -- at least since the Simpson-Bowles commission reported.\xc2\xa0 It is the size of deficit reduction that has been identified by the fiscal commission, named after former Senator Simpson and Erskine Bowles.\xc2\xa0 It is the rough size of the deficit reduction package identified by the President in his framework.\xc2\xa0 It is the size of the deficit reduction package that was passed by the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 So, in that sense, absolutely it\xe2\x80\x99s on -- it was on the table; it remains on the table.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the parameters of what a deal would look like -- that requires Democrats to do things that they\xe2\x80\x99re not entirely comfortable doing, and Republicans to do things that they\xe2\x80\x99re not entirely comfortable doing, but that together, if they were willing to do it, they could achieve something big -- the parameters of that deal are well known by the participants in the negotiations that have been ongoing now for several weeks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it possible that the President could agree to some sort of two-part agreement, where there would be a way to raise the debt ceiling and perhaps have some spending cuts that don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do with revenues or entitlements, and then have a second train, if you will, that\xe2\x80\x99s heading towards the station that has -- some sort of agreement that is similar to what\xe2\x80\x99s laid out in the Gang of Six, or that was part of the original grand bargain or whatever -- would that be something that the President would be willing to accept?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, that kind of granular analysis or hypothesizing I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do.\xc2\xa0 I think that there is the potential here for a significant agreement.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously differences, as there have been throughout this process.\xc2\xa0 We believe there is momentum behind the idea of a balanced approach to a significant agreement.\xc2\xa0 How the mechanisms would work if we were able to achieve that agreement, I will leave to the negotiators.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Goler.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you consider House Majority Leader Cantor\xe2\x80\x99s statement that there are some elements to the Gang of Six proposal that have promise to be a kind of threshold this thing has gotten over?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been -- pretty much believed to be the toughest negotiator for the Republicans in this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there have been a number of statements in public that have been mildly encouraging from a number of people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, there have also -- and I get questions usually about the other kinds of statements that seem to be torpedoing any potential for progress or seem to be restatements of ultimatums that would prevent any significant compromise.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to take account of everything that\xe2\x80\x99s said in public, but also to, as veteran reporters like yourself clearly understand, listen with and evaluate the kind of comments you hear in public with some contextual understanding for how processes like these work.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s just simply to say that there have been a lot of positive comments about the potential for a bigger deal, the potential for a balanced deal, the potential for embracing the approach that the President supports.\xc2\xa0 We are not there, but we remain hopeful that we could get there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In The New York Times a couple days ago, there was a report on White House officials entertaining the idea they can run for reelection without being able to point to a strengthening economy.\xc2\xa0 I want to question the accuracy of that, and whether or not you believe you might have to run, the President might have to run for reelection without the benefit of a strengthening economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, two things remain uncontestably true:\xc2\xa0 The economy is vastly improved from what it was when Barack Obama was sworn into office as President.\xc2\xa0 We were in economic freefall; there were predictions that we were headed to the second Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 We were losing up to -- over 700,000 jobs a month.\xc2\xa0 We were contracting at greater than 6 percent, our economy was.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the economy has improved.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll stipulate that, but it looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s slowing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It has not improved enough.\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we face headwinds.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been very direct about that, and we need to do everything we can across the front to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing what we can to spur growth, spur job creation.\xc2\xa0 Part of that is doing the work he\xe2\x80\x99s doing this week and last week and probably next week to try to achieve a significant deficit reduction deal with Congress that does not restrain growth, does not undermine the recovery that we have, but strengthens it, so -- and allows us to continue to invest in the key areas that will allow us to grow and create jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what remains obvious to him and to everyone is that this economy is nowhere near where it needs to be.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he is focused every day, he wakes up every day and goes to sleep every night thinking about the fact that he will not rest, he will not cease in his efforts to grow the economy and create jobs until he knows that every American who\xe2\x80\x99s looking for a job can find one.\xc2\xa0 And that will undoubtedly remain true throughout his first term.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, earlier in the briefing you said the leaders met yesterday going through what can be done.\xc2\xa0 I assume that\xe2\x80\x99s a reference to votes -- vote counts.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, what can be done.\xc2\xa0 Yes, what can pass.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 So do any of the plans currently being discussed, to the extent that we understand them, have the votes to pass?\xc2\xa0 And if not, where are the sticking points?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I mentioned yesterday that I spent a little time covering Congress and enjoyed it immensely, but I am --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not looking for analysis.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking for what was said inside the meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So the -- well, as you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not reading out what\xe2\x80\x99s being said inside the meeting.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply suggest that the best judges of what can pass the House and the Senate are the leaders of the House and the Senate and the whips, the vote counters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are obviously listening very closely to them in our conversations about what they believe their members will support, what they believe they can persuade their members to support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as I said earlier, in answer to a question, it is clear that -- and it is historically true that in issues like this that are tough and difficult and intensely negotiated, that it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly unlikely we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get unanimous support, if and when we get a significant deficit reduction deal.\xc2\xa0 But we are relying obviously -- well, we have our eyes and ears, but we speak regularly with leaders of both parties in the House and the Senate to get their assessments of what the institution will bear.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 You also said any significantly sized package has to be balanced.\xc2\xa0 Can you define where is the threshold for \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into numerical specifics about that.\xc2\xa0 I think there is a general sense, as we discussed in the last couple weeks, about the sort of $1.5 trillion in spending cuts that we believe --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is significant?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We believe is -- represents what folks on all sides can agree to.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, it requires some tough choices.\xc2\xa0 Beyond maybe $1.7 trillion it requires some tough choices.\xc2\xa0 And we get into territory where there has to be a willingness to compromise, there has to be a willingness along the part of the Democrats to get out of their comfort zone to allow for the fact that some modest reforms in entitlement programs will strengthen those programs, as well as provide savings, and put them in a sounder fiscal condition for the future; and a willingness by Republicans to recognize that revenue has to be part of this deal if you want it to be big and significant --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Above $1.7 trillion.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- and address -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you the numbers of -- about the spending cuts that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, we begin to get into the territory that requires leaders to lead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And finally, the House isn\xe2\x80\x99t in session this week.\xc2\xa0 What do you think?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I direct you to the House.\xc2\xa0 I am confident that we will continue to work --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it be bleaker if they were here?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the leaders of both houses have taken action in terms of the schedule to deal with the fact that we are in intense negotiations and we need to get something done within a short period of time.\xc2\xa0 But I leave it to them to decide how that will work for them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carol.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you said earlier that you\xe2\x80\x99re not close to a deal; there\xe2\x80\x99s been no progress made.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said no progress to report.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To report, right.\xc2\xa0 So why should anybody believe that in the next 11 days you guys are going to make progress and be -- and actually reach a deal, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on this for months?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s like saying, you know, why should anybody believe Christmas is going to come until Christmas Day.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or Santa.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Or Santa.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Because obviously there won\xe2\x80\x99t be a deal until there is a deal.\xc2\xa0 So the fact that I can stand up to you and say that reports that we\xe2\x80\x99re close to a deal are incorrect doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be one.\xc2\xa0 And what -- again, my confidence -- we remain optimistic -- we remain confident that a deal can be reached, that a significant deficit reduction can be reached and that there is time to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are also cold-eyed realists about the challenges that reaching such a deal are presented -- or present themselves.\xc2\xa0 What we do know is that within the next 11 days, the Congress will do as the leaders have said it will do, which is to take action to ensure that we do not, for the first time in our history, find ourselves unable to pay our bills.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m curious how you\xe2\x80\x99re not close when we\xe2\x80\x99re so close to the deadline.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President went to Florida very much hoping to witness the penultimate shuttle launch.\xc2\xa0 And, regrettably, I was on that trip and regret it myself that that launch was scrubbed and postponed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he has tremendous regard for the program and for all the folks at NASA who participated in making it such a tremendous success.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s future and moving forward with space exploration in the future.\xc2\xa0 And we can -- if you want, we can talk more about that.\xc2\xa0 But the fact that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on his schedule this week is not indicative of that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we released a photograph of him watching the launch of the final shuttle mission.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will not address the current negotiations and the content of them.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that the parameters of what -- a significantly sized deal are clear, and they include spending cuts, reductions in defense spending, savings through entitlement reform, savings through the tax code.\xc2\xa0 The kinds of savings through the tax code that we have talked about have also been -- are also pretty clear; we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about them, in terms of closing loopholes and subsidies.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about tax reform.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not -- that is a general -- that is a general statement about the parameters of what a balanced approach to deficit reduction would look like.\xc2\xa0 And if we achieve an agreement on a balanced approach, it will look like that.\xc2\xa0 But the details are obviously -- would have to be worked out.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there would still be time, at this late in the game, to have some sort of deal that includes -- that includes new revenue in the way that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And remember that when we talk -- I mean, a deal would have to be implemented, and there would be stages of implementation and things like that.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not like everything has to happen instantly on August 2nd or 3rd.\xc2\xa0 But there is -- in any case, in any kind of broad, sweeping legislation that would be true, and that would be true in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did administration officials notify top lawmakers last night that a grand bargain type of deal could be soon or imminent?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are conversations ongoing with members of Congress, involving members of the White House and the broader administration about what the various options of a big deal would look like, a smaller deal would look like, and a really small deal would look like.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So were there discussions, have there been discussions ongoing about what a deal would look like?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Were there discussions -- have anybody here been telling folks that we\xe2\x80\x99re close to a deal?\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have its own proposal that it is floating?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a body in the House that\xe2\x80\x99s 435 members strong.\xc2\xa0 And obviously all of them speak for themselves individually, as well as Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And there is no question, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said several times now, that there will not be unanimity.\xc2\xa0 I would be shocked.\xc2\xa0 I would buy everyone here lunch if there is unanimity in a vote here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what I meant.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken to other members of the Gang of Six.\xc2\xa0 I think I mentioned, or at least I meant to mention, that -- or I meant to say yesterday if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, I could be repeating myself, that as you know two of the members of the United States Senate whom the President counts as friends happen to be members of the Gangs of Six.\xc2\xa0 So you can be assured that he has conversations with them and he has certainly had conversations with others.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He embraced the broad outlines of what they\xe2\x80\x99ve said; I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming he\xe2\x80\x99s looked at the details of it.\xc2\xa0 Does he -- is his interpretation of their proposal that it includes a net tax increase or a net tax decrease?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a great opportunity for him to talk to young people -- I think there will be others as well but -- young people, students there about -- to explain that this really is a debate about the economy and about jobs and about how we need to stabilize the foundation of our economy so that we can grow and create jobs and lessen the economic anxiety that\xe2\x80\x99s out there.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that it is felt by students.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s also important -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a great opportunity to speak to students, because there is and there has been for a long time now a lot of doubt among younger Americans about whether or not those kinds of programs that protect folks in their old age -- the Social Security and Medicare programs -- will be there for them.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President will make the case that he is absolutely committed to ensuring that those programs will be there and they will be strong, and they will be providing benefits to their generation as well as current senior citizens, retirees.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good opportunity, because we get -- we find ourselves here talking about raising the debt ceiling and what things look like in the out-years, and the alternative minimum tax, and that kind of stuff.\xc2\xa0 And I think a lot of it is muddying up the picture and confusing to a lot of folks who don\xe2\x80\x99t have the time to focus on it.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a good opportunity to talk about what it means at its root, which is it\xe2\x80\x99s a debate about getting our economy in the best possible position for the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Helene.\xc2\xa0 Mark?\xc2\xa0 No?\xc2\xa0 Going back.\xc2\xa0 Ann.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more on this -- late yesterday, one hour and 21 minutes, the President of the United States and the Speaker looked each other in the eye.\xc2\xa0 Are they --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize the discussions.\xc2\xa0 They are certainly -- there is more clarity with every discussion they have.\xc2\xa0 The President is meeting not just with Speaker Boehner.\xc2\xa0 Majority Leader Cantor was there.\xc2\xa0 He had meetings with House and Senate Democratic leaders yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s had conversations with all of them and many others, and will continue to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is -- there is not just one dance partner here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that this is something that has to get through both houses of Congress, and you have a two-party system here.\xc2\xa0 And there are obviously a lot of disagreements and strongly held views.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of just can these two men agree; it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of making sure that we can achieve something significant for the American people, and the only way to do that is to get majorities in the House and the Senate for a deficit reduction bill that the President can sign.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Christi.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, so apparently the markets have reacted to the New York Times alert, and then again to -- since you\xe2\x80\x99ve been speaking.\xc2\xa0 And I just wonder if it\xe2\x80\x99s your impression that this is beginning to come to bear on the talks at all.\xc2\xa0 I mean, was there any sign yesterday, for example, when the two different groups were here that people are starting to put pressure?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think everyone in the room is keenly aware of the fact that the world is watching, that the world wants to know if Washington can function; if this great democracy with its two-party system can tackle big problems; if the leaders who are elected and sent here can come together and compromise and take the necessary measures to ensure that we pay our bills -- and that will happen -- and to get our deficits and debt under control, so that we can continue to grow and be the greatest engine for economic growth in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We can do that, and we hope that this process will eventually, as messy as it is, demonstrate that the answer to those questions is yes, across the board.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, look, I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not my intention to affect markets or anything like that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m simply clarifying that the reports are -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re somehow close to a deal are not accurate.\xc2\xa0 They are talking.\xc2\xa0 Lines of communication are open.\xc2\xa0 They continue to have discussions.\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe that a significant deficit reduction deal is possible.\xc2\xa0 We certainly believe that is preferable.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to be absolutely confident that the United States will continue to have the capacity to pay its bills beyond August 2nd.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So -- but certainly, there is a lot at stake here.\xc2\xa0 Setting aside the issue of the debt ceiling, there is a lot at stake.\xc2\xa0 We have an opportunity here to deal with a problem that has been with us for a while, and that if left unresolved, poses significant trouble for us in the future.\xc2\xa0 We should grab that opportunity and do something big for the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you at least give us where both sides are?\xc2\xa0 The President was talking about this overlap yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Could you at least detail what the overlap is, where they are in agreement, commonality --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, there will be a time when this is over, and hopefully we can all be celebrating a significant accomplishment to go through where people were on which day, and where the disagreements were and where the agreements were.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the interest of achieving a result for me to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to say and what the President has talked about and others, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to go -- because I want to allow everyone who is participating in these negotiations as much freedom of movement as possible so that they can get something done.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there a fear that it\xe2\x80\x99s so tenuous that if you say something that they -- one side may pull back saying something that they\xe2\x80\x99re not in agreement or something?\xc2\xa0 Is that your fear?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that these are difficult negotiations that will involve having to get something passed through the House and the Senate, and that we need to maximize the potential for success, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also with -- also, Marc Morial and Ben Jealous are meeting with the President today about African American unemployment, which stands at 16.2 percent.\xc2\xa0 This White House, this administration came out with a report not long ago -- the \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Workforce in the Recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What can the President tell these two leaders as more cuts are expected and the black community is expected to have a hit -- especially as they once again are employed in a large number of the federal government and also benefit from federal government programs?\xc2\xa0 What is the President --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that one of the reasons why the President is so committed to idea that we have to address our deficits and debt in a balanced way is so that we do not unfairly burden any segment of society as we tighten our belts and get our fiscal house in order.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He has also -- as he did from this podium -- made it clear that there is an important case to be made to progressives that we have to get our debt and deficit under control in order to allow us to continue to invest in the areas that are essential to create jobs, to grow the economy, and to allow us to maintain the kind of benefits that protect the vulnerable among us.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is all of a piece here.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, this meeting -- the President meets regularly with leaders to discuss a range of topics, including economic stability and job creation.\xc2\xa0 And he will thank both leaders whom you mentioned for their contributions in under-served communities across the country and congratulate them on their upcoming conventions.\xc2\xa0 As you know, both organizations have conventions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President reach out to them, or they reached out to the President, this meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would have to get back to you on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Toshi.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Back in April, when the government shutdown was looming, the administration issued a guidance -- what would happen in the event of a government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any plan to do the same kind of thing here?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Treasury Department or Office of Management and Budget.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we are absolutely confident that Congress will act in order to ensure that the debt ceiling is raised.\xc2\xa0 But for anything more I would send you to Treasury or OMB.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really quickly, back on the space shuttle program, of course, the program essentially ends today, and with it thousands of people -- NASA employees, contractors -- will be out of work.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s message, Jay, to those folks down on Florida, Texas and Alabama who are going to be out of work now with the space shuttle program ending and very confused as to why the shuttle program is ending without any replacement for the shuttle there to replace it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President has laid out an ambitious vision for human space flight that will take American astronauts beyond where we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been before with the ultimate goal being a human mission to Mars.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s vision, negotiated with bipartisan support from Congress, allows NASA to focus its resources on exploration and innovation while leveraging private sector resources to continue taking Americans to the International Space Station in low-Earth orbit, whose mission has been extended until at least 2020.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This new strategy -- addressing your point -- means more jobs for the country, more American astronauts in space over the next decade and more investments in innovation relative to the prior administration\xe2\x80\x99s plan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we believe that with the resources we have, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus NASA\xe2\x80\x99s mission on the kind of advances that I just discussed and that the strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with Congress in a bipartisan way to put together is the right way to go, and it will ultimately lead to more jobs, as well as more astronauts in space and potentially in the future something really dramatic like fulfillment of the goal of a human mission to Mars.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All the way in the back.\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that a readout of the meetings and a tick-tock could imperil negotiations, then if you were close to a deal you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell us anyway?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, next question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Senator Tom Coburn just said that he bets that if CC&amp;B were able to pass the Senate and get to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk, he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to bet a porterhouse that the President would sign it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If what -- or he really?\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If it passed the Senate, he\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to bet a porterhouse that the President would sign it.\xc2\xa0 If, in fact, it did pass the Senate, should he go out and get the A-1?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well said.\xc2\xa0 I have a feeling we\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear this exchange on the radio, but the -- (laughter) -- we would take that bet.\xc2\xa0 And I would refrain from heading to the Safeway to buy A-1 because the President has very clearly vowed to veto a bill if such a bill were to arrive on his desk because it is a draconian measure that in terms of its impact on dramatic cuts in Social Security, Medicare, would make the Ryan budget plan pale by comparison.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an irresponsible thing to do.\xc2\xa0 We should not have to amend the Constitution so that Congress does the job that it was elected to do, and that the leaders in Washington do the job that they were elected to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t need to.\xc2\xa0 We have before us the possibility of actually doing what Americans sent us here to do, which is compromise and achieve significant deficit reduction in a balanced way that puts us on the right path for the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jon-Christopher.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, quick.\xc2\xa0 I think this may be a little breaking.\xc2\xa0 A third of the House Republicans have signed a letter refusing to adopt the McConnell plan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I got a question about that before.\xc2\xa0 And as I just said, whatever the vehicle is, we remain confident that at the very least, Congress will absolutely take appropriate action to ensure that we raise our debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear, without detailing every meeting and conversation, that senior members of the White House and administration have been in regular contact, up to and including the President with leaders on Congress, as we try to negotiate a solution here, an agreement here.\xc2\xa0 So that -- those sightings would be completely in keeping with what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said about that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, yes, I did promise you a question.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We absolutely categorically the violence.\xc2\xa0 We call on the Syrian regime to cease the violence.\xc2\xa0 We are working with our partners internationally to put pressure on the Syrian regime to get it to cease.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that it is clear now that the -- that President Assad has given up the opportunity to lead the transition that the Syrian people will demand, and he has lost legitimacy by doing so.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all I have to say.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 1:45 P.M.
