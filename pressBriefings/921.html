Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:31 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the White House.\xc2\xa0 It is awesome to see you all here.\xc2\xa0 Before I get started -- rather, before I take your questions, I have a readout of the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with congressional leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tToday, President Obama, over sandwiches from Taylor Gourmet, a shop many of you have sampled, met with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President urged the leaders to act on additional measures to create jobs and strengthen the economic recovery, including the five items on the President\xe2\x80\x99s "To-Do" list for Congress -- like the tax cuts for small businesses that the President discussed with local entrepreneurs earlier today at Taylor Gourmet.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Congress "To-Do" list also includes items like helping veterans find jobs, and assistance to responsible homeowners -- in other words, the kind of priorities that Republicans and Democrats should be able to work together on to help the economy and support the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President emphasized the need for Congress to avoid refighting old political fights, and act to prevent interest rates on student loans from doubling on July 1.\xc2\xa0 The President also made clear that he refuses to allow a replay of last summer\xe2\x80\x99s self-inflicted political crisis that eroded confidence and hurt the American economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President reminded the leaders that he has signed into law over $2 trillion in deficit reduction, bringing domestic spending to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the Eisenhower administration.\xc2\xa0 The President reiterated that any serious bipartisan approach to tackle our deficit must be a balanced approach, and he made clear his willingness to work with Republicans and Democrats to stake out an agreement along those lines, but was just as clear that he would not accept an approach that asks middle-class families and senior citizens to make sacrifices without asking for anything more from millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim from the Associated Press.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On that point then, did the President raise the issue that Boehner raised yesterday regarding the debt ceiling?\xc2\xa0 And does the President feel that he\xe2\x80\x99s in a better bargaining position, given that the Bush tax cuts end December 31st, the mandatory spending cuts begin next year -- does he feel that he can, one, negotiate that kind of balanced approach that he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about in a better way than he could in the summer?\xc2\xa0 And can he indeed separate the debt ceiling debate from that debate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The topic did come up.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker raised it and the President made clear, as I just said, that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to recreate the debt ceiling debacle of last August.\xc2\xa0 It is simply not acceptable to hold the American and global economy hostage to one party\xe2\x80\x99s political ideology.\xc2\xa0 It is the responsibility of Congress to ensure that the United States of America pays its bills, that it maintains its creditworthiness, that it fulfills its obligation and maintains the full faith and credit that it has long enjoyed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also important that Congress act together with the President to deal with our medium- and long-term fiscal challenges.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has put forward a balanced approach to those challenges in his budget that cuts the deficit by over $4 trillion, that incorporates the $2 trillion in domestic spending cuts that the President has already signed into law -- non-defense discretionary cuts that bring that portion of the budget to its lowest level since Dwight Eisenhower was President, since before many -- most of the people in this room were born.\xc2\xa0 Present company excluded, I guess.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that give him more leverage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to game out how -- what the future looks like.\xc2\xa0 What the President is intently focused on is, A, the need for Congress to work together on the kinds of things that are in the "To-Do" list, as well as student loans, as well as the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, as well as the transportation bill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are all things that have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 These are all things that should pass with bipartisan support that the President should be able to sign into law if members of Congress come together and do the right thing and basically surprise the American people by demonstrating that in an election year and despite our differences, that we can get the things done that need to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also -- as the President made clear in the meeting, it is also the case that if Republicans in the Congress end their intransigence and adopt the balanced approach to our deficit and debt challenges that everyone else overwhelmingly believes -- and adopt what everyone else overwhelmingly believes is the right approach, which is a balanced approach, which includes not just discretionary spending cuts, not just entitlement reforms but also revenues -- then there is ample opportunity here to put into place a long-term budget that both ensures we continue to grow our economy and create jobs, and significantly reduces our deficits and debt.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there any discussion about invoking the 14th Amendment in order to avoid that kind of brinksmanship?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not believe so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On one other subject, if I may.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you -- when you were asked about Bain, you said, well, those are campaign ads.\xc2\xa0 But today, the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I said a great deal more than that, but they were, in fact, a campaign ad -- it was a question based on a campaign ad.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, today, the Vice President raised -- issues that were raised in that campaign ad, so I was wondering if you could talk specifically about what is it about how Romney ran Bain that informs us how well he would govern.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, again, this is the kind of question specifically about the campaign that is best directed to the campaign, to the President\'s campaign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe broader point, which I made yesterday, is that the President looks forward to discussing with the American people and debating with his opponent what the right vision for America\'s future is when it comes to the economy, and what the President\'s record shows about what he believes is the right way to go, and what his opponent\'s record shows about the approach he might take -- both his record and what he has said.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what elections are all about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think one area of agreement that I\'ve noticed here is that we all think the economy is the number-one issue.\xc2\xa0 And the President very strongly believes, as you\'ve heard him say, that in order to ensure that we continue to see the economy grow, to ensure that we continue to see jobs created, and to ensure that the middle class in this country is secure and expands and continues to be the backbone of the nation, we need to invest in the right areas like education and innovation and infrastructure, research and development, clean energy.\xc2\xa0 We need to deal with our deficit and debt in a way that does not ask senior citizens and the middle class to bear all the burden, but asks everyone to do their fair share.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s a vision that he\'ll put forward and looks forward to debating in the campaign season.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, what is it about Bain that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that is a specific question for the campaign, and while a part of me would enjoy the opportunity to engage with that, I would ask you to take a purely campaign question based on a campaign ad --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it is purely --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- well, the Vice President -- he was speaking at a campaign event about the Republican nominee, or presumptive nominee.\xc2\xa0 I think you can ask the campaign about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\'s representing the campaign but not the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, what\xe2\x80\x99s your question exactly?\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s about campaign tactics and why --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, just why can\'t you answer the question about Bain, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xc2\xa0 What is it about Bain that makes it an important issue in this campaign?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I can interpret what the campaign has said, which is that the experience of loading up companies with debt, pulling out profits, and in many cases having companies fail and workers lose their jobs, and prior to losing their jobs lose their pensions and other benefits, is not the kind of experience that the President thinks, the campaign thinks, is the right experience that you would want to then apply to the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, I think this is a question that the campaign can answer more fully.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of risk, though, that is inherent to a private equity --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and the President has used the argument about risk when he\xe2\x80\x99s talked and defended the loans to Solyndra.\xc2\xa0 So is there a difference in tackling risk and --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that being President entails many other responsibilities, obligations and decisions that go beyond whether or not -- the decision to invest in a certain company or invest in a sector like clean energy. It\xe2\x80\x99s an aspect of it, but it is not the complete experience that informs how you make decisions as President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you talk about the atmospherics of today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting?\xc2\xa0 And also, did Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s comments yesterday about the debt ceiling change the tone of the meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President had lunch with the leaders alone.\xc2\xa0 I was not in there.\xc2\xa0 No staff was in there.\xc2\xa0 I spoke with the President afterwards.\xc2\xa0 My sense is the tone was congenial, the discussion was productive, the sandwiches were delicious -- and that while the topic was raised and discussed, there was no other issue associated with -- or no problem associated with Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s remarks yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What portion of the meeting was taken up by that?\xc2\xa0 And I know the President wanted to talk about --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think my readout of the meeting and the percentage of time spent on the various topics is a fair representation of the percentages of the meeting and how they broke down.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President did call a meeting to talk about his "To-Do" list.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And they spent some time talking about that.\xc2\xa0 They spent some time talking about the fact that -- and I think this was noted not just by the President but by others in the room, and members of both parties -- that, in fact, the President and this Congress, Republicans and Democrats, have worked together to get a number of things done despite their differences, despite the fact that this is an election year.\xc2\xa0 And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve noted before, that includes extending the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 It includes extending unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 It includes the STOCK Act and the so-called JOBS Act.\xc2\xa0 And it includes the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, among other things.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the kinds of initiatives that are included in the President\xe2\x80\x99s "To-Do" list for Congress are similar to those in that they should be able to garner bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 They are the kinds of things that, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the assistance to small businesses or assistance to veterans, have traditionally enjoyed both Democratic and Republican support, and should this time enjoy bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there was a significant portion of the meeting dedicated to that -- the items on the "To-Do" list and other things like the surface transportation bill and the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act that are other examples of the kinds of things that should be able to get done in spite of the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s an election year.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around here.\xc2\xa0 Olivier, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you -- yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Not that long ago you said it was maybe time to admit defeat on the ceasefire plan in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And then yesterday you came out and you sounded a lot more positive about it.\xc2\xa0 You said it had tamped down the violence there.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s changed?\xc2\xa0 Why the change in tone?\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- it\'s still time to admit -- or possibly time to admit defeat?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the state of play?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that we support the Annan plan.\xc2\xa0 We remain very skeptical about Assad\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to comply with the Annan plan.\xc2\xa0 We note that he has yet to comply fully with any of the six points within it.\xc2\xa0 We support it, however, because while it is not being fulfilled -- compliance is not being met by Assad, it has served to reduce the violence somewhat, which obviously is a good thing, and it serves as a foundation for the future political reconciliation that will be required, and it is essential for the better future that the Syrian people so obviously deserve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you aware of media reports that other Gulf states are providing weapons to Syria\xe2\x80\x99s opposition?\xc2\xa0 And are they doing that with either the tacit or explicit support from this administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly aware of the reports and I think you know where we are on this -- we, the United States.\xc2\xa0 We continue to provide non-lethal support to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 And while I can only speak for the United States, we know that others are pursuing different types of support, and I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them to characterize the nature of their actions.\xc2\xa0 Our position on this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.</p>\n<p>\n\tNorah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office has put out his readout of what happened inside the meeting, and according to them, the Speaker directly asked the President whether he would propose any cuts along with raising the debt ceiling and the President said no.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Speaker said, should we -- are you saying that we should pass a clean debt ceiling, which is a little different, but the essence is the same.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s point was we should not hold the full faith and credit of the United States hostage to one party\xe2\x80\x99s political agenda.\xc2\xa0 It is the absolute responsibility of Congress to ensure that the United States of America is good on its word, that it pays its bills.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also the case that we need to take action in a balanced way to deal with our deficit and debt.\xc2\xa0 That has always been our position.\xc2\xa0 It is embodied in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget.\xc2\xa0 It is embodied in the efforts the President made last summer to try to reach a so-called grand bargain, and it is his position today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would note that it is widely accepted now -- although, regrettably, not universally accepted -- that the primary stumbling block to bipartisan cooperation on this issue is the absolute intransigence, the absolute refusal of Republicans to accept what bipartisan commissions accept, what Democrats, independents and Republicans out in the country accept, which is that we need a balanced approach to this; that we need to -- in order to get control of our deficit and debts, we need not only to cut significantly -- as we have already -- domestic, non-defense discretionary spending, we need to introduce reforms in our entitlement systems that strengthen them and, in the President\'s vision, reduce costs, health care costs, without burdening seniors, and we need to make sure that everybody does their fair share, we need to include revenues as part of the package.</p>\n<p>\n\tI note -- and it stuns me, Norah.\xc2\xa0 If I could just point out -- because your question reminds me of something I read at some ungodly hour this morning since my son woke up early -- which is that Chairman Paul Ryan of the Budget Committee was on television last night and he chastised the President for disavowing the Bowles-Simpson Commission without mentioning that he himself was a member of the Bowles-Simpson Commission and voted no.\xc2\xa0 He voted no to the balanced approach that the Bowles-Simpson Commission recommended -- a balanced approach which is mirrored by the President\'s own budget; a balanced approach which is universally, by those who\'ve looked at this who aren\'t elected members of Congress or the Republican Party, viewed as the essential answer to the challenge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Paul Ryan voted against it, but the President also didn\xe2\x80\x99t endorse it or enact any of it.\xc2\xa0 So I think --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President put forward a budget proposal that embodies the balanced approach that the Simpson-Bowles Commission -- which he appointed -- recommended.\xc2\xa0 That is a fact.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat balanced approach is nowhere evident in the Ryan budget, it\'s nowhere evident in the rhetoric of House Republican leaders, regrettably.\xc2\xa0 Because overwhelmingly, that\xe2\x80\x99s where we have to go to successfully overcome the challenges that we face when it comes to our medium and long-term deficit and debt.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today we have the President of the United States insisting on a clean debt increase.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me just -- the President is insisting on one position, and the Speaker is also insisting that he will not increase the debt limit unless there are spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 So are we headed, again, to another one of these debacles?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you have to ask the Speaker of the House whether or not he intends or he believes that it is the right thing to do for the American people, the American economy, to play chicken with the full faith and credit of the United States government.\xc2\xa0 The President says we\'re not --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where is the compromise?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The compromise is a balanced approach that everybody who is not an elected member of Congress, of the Republican Party, has identified as the right solution.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why can\'t you increase the debt limit on balanced cuts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The compromise is the President is willing to cut non-defense discretionary spending to its lowest level since the Eisenhower administration.\xc2\xa0 This President has signed into law non-defense discretionary spending cuts that brings that portion of our budget to its lowest level as a percentage of GDP since Ike was President -- before you were born -- significantly.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat demonstrates against the charge that Democrats don\xe2\x80\x99t want spending cuts a significant compromise.\xc2\xa0 He cuts discretionary spending.\xc2\xa0 He has put forward entitlement reforms that, as you know, are sometimes difficult for Democrats to accept.\xc2\xa0 But he has successfully made the point that we need -- that if we take a balanced approach, we do not need to, and we should not and must not, ask middle-class Americans and senior citizens to bear all the burden of overcoming our deficit and debt challenges -- which is what the Ryan budget does.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt says, you know what, we\'re going to give more tax cuts to the wealthy; we\'re going to dramatically cut investments in education, innovation, research and development.\xc2\xa0 And how are we going to pay for all this?\xc2\xa0 Well, there\'s a magic asterisk, for one thing; he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really say.\xc2\xa0 But the answer is, we\'re going to stick it to the middle class -- because we\'re not going to ask the wealthiest Americans who have, unlike the middle class, done exceptionally well over the past 10 years or so, to contribute, to do their fair share.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s just not an approach that the President believes is right, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t represent in any way a willingness to compromise.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a quick response to Speaker Boehner, who, this morning in his press conference before he came over here, asked, where is the President\'s plan to tackle our looming debt crisis?\xc2\xa0 Can you answer that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Speaker knows exactly where it is. You know exactly where it is.\xc2\xa0 He presented a budget that does just that -- that cuts our deficits by over $4 trillion and ensures that we continue to invest in the areas of the economy and in the middle class that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the President\'s budget is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is -- look, it cannot be that the way to get to an answer is compromise, A, and then you refuse to compromise, B.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\'s budget proposal reflects the priorities of bipartisan commissions; it reflects the approach of Republicans on --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But his own party won\'t even bring it up for a vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But where are the Republicans?\xc2\xa0 Where have they demonstrated a willingness to compromise?\xc2\xa0 Where have they demonstrated a willingness to do what everyone on the outside -- including a majority of the American people, including a majority of the Republicans in this country -- believe is the right thing to do, which is to say there are three legs to this stool, and we need all three of them to make the stool stands.\xc2\xa0 And that means discretionary cuts, it means entitlement reforms and it means revenues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At today\'s meeting was the President saying, I\'m not going to budge, and the Speaker saying, I\'m not going to budge?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, there is a lot that the Congress and the President can work together to get done, as they discussed as well.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to Congress taking action on the "To-Do" list and on other items, like making sure student loans don\xe2\x80\x99t double -- the interest rates on student loans don\'t double in the next couple of months, making sure that the Violence Against Women Act gets reauthorized in a bipartisan way, as it has consistently over the years, making sure that we keep construction workers on the job working to rebuild our infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are things that the American people want done.\xc2\xa0 These are things that Republicans, Democrats have traditionally supported together.\xc2\xa0 These are things that the President has indicated he wants to sign into law.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\'s an opportunity here for Congress to act on them and prove that even in this environment and even in this election year they are willing to do the work that the American people sent them here to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tJared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, was there an agreement in the room among the parties that there shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be this hostage-taking or chicken-playing, or whatever metaphor you want to use?\xc2\xa0 Were the rest of the parties in agreement on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you should ask the leaders themselves.\xc2\xa0 I can simply characterize what the President\'s view was and what he expressed in the meeting about how he simply will not accept an approach that tries to recreate the self-inflicted political wounds that caused harm to the economy last summer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that in agreement even among the Democratic leaders?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I simply -- you\'re putting words into my readout, which I didn\xe2\x80\x99t include.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I said that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize what the other leaders think.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m simply characterizing what the President said.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick point of clarification.\xc2\xa0 The $4 trillion in deficit reduction, about $2 trillion of that is from winding down the war in Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s separate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That figure is too high.\xc2\xa0 As the original Ryan budget does, it includes OCO, which is the acronym, which stands for something that means what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And it demonstrates the savings from policy decisions that this President made to end the war in Iraq and to put us on a path of ending the war in Afghanistan -- policy decisions that are hugely significant not just as foreign policy and national security matters, and not just for the men and women who are sent overseas to fight on our behalf, but for budgetary reasons -- and policy decisions, which, by the way, leaders -- at least some of the leaders in the other party reject, those who say we should still have American soldiers in Iraq, those who say that we should not have a timetable for ending the war in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou can\xe2\x80\x99t have it both ways.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t say you\xe2\x80\x99d rather reverse those policies, continue to have troops in Iraq, prolong our stay in Afghanistan, which, of course, requires money to pay for them, and then say but you can\xe2\x80\x99t count that savings that are a result of concrete policy decisions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul Ryan thought they were legitimate in his first budget proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, not really.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He did.\xc2\xa0 There were in -- go look at the Ryan budget.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s in there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is one way of scoring in which it\xe2\x80\x99s in there and then the way of scoring that they presented where it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- but that\xe2\x80\x99s not really what I want to talk about.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 These are concrete savings from a budget -- from policy decisions that the President of the United States put in place, that others, were they in the Oval Office, would not have put in place, with all the resulting costs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In six and a half months, we\xe2\x80\x99re facing this potential debacle, this $8 trillion.\xc2\xa0 How much energy does the President intend to devote to trying to solve this problem before it reaches a crisis in December?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward a budget proposal that solves -- I mean, if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about negotiating with congressional leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- dealing with the sequester, which, by the way, the Congress voted for the Budget Control Act.\xc2\xa0 The Congress assigned itself the task of coming up with a balanced solution -- coming up with a solution -- the only successful one has to be balanced if it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be bipartisan -- in order to avoid the sequester, which no party wants to see enacted.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Congress failed.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Congress continues to have that opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Congress failed.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m with you.\xc2\xa0 We have this problem six and half months from now --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But it is a part of the American ethic that when you get knocked down, you get up and you keep trying.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what Congress ought to do.\xc2\xa0 They ought to come together, work out a balanced approached.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward concretely and specifically the ideas that he thinks should guide that approach.\xc2\xa0 The policy choices here are pretty clear.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of debate and discussion and serious-minded negotiation on these subjects.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity that remains, as the President made clear in the meeting and as I made clear in my readout of the meeting -- it remains for the kind of bipartisan compromise around a balanced approach that the budget the President put forward represents.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to clarify, the answer is, no, the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not true at all.\xc2\xa0 I mean, they talked about it today.\xc2\xa0 The key stumbling block here --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the Republicans in the House refuse to raise any taxes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Refuse to acknowledge that the only way to do this, the only way to come together and get this done, is to adopt the balanced approach that not just the President, but just about everyone else who\xe2\x80\x99s looked at this has deemed the right way to do it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said on a number of issues, the President accepts the fact that just because he says he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do, Republicans may not then do it, but they have constituents they need to answer to.\xc2\xa0 And one of the more remarkable things about the apparent desire to recreate the debacle of last summer that was precipitated by the same approach the Speaker of the House suggested we adopt again is that the American people thought it was a terrible thing.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they would reward leaders who suggest that the right way to fulfill their responsibility as leaders is to risk tanking the American economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just terrible.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not leadership.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a failure of leadership.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the right way to get something done is to agree that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get everything you want, and look at what so many people have put forward as the necessary path for bipartisan compromise.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The $1.2 -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s $1.2 trillion in cuts that are the sequester cuts that automatically kick in.\xc2\xa0 If the Bush tax cuts -- $4 trillion worth -- expire, would that eliminate the need to sequester $1.2 trillion in cuts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, mathematically it might be so.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done the analysis myself.\xc2\xa0 But the President, as you know, believes we should extend tax cuts for the middle class and we absolutely should end unnecessary tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, I know, but you also feel that not everybody is going to get everything they want.\xc2\xa0 So I was just wondering, is it possible --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that wouldn\'t represent everything we want.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a mechanism in there -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a technical question -- if the $4 trillion in tax cuts expire, does that negate the need for $1.2 trillion in --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about apples and oranges here.\xc2\xa0 And I think there are a lot of things that people have talked about that rise to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not really.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- that will be dealt with, if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been by then, by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s $4 trillion in revenue.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But there are a number of issues that -- there\xe2\x80\x99s the Bush tax cuts, there\xe2\x80\x99s the sequester.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate how that plays out now --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not asking you to negotiate.\xc2\xa0 But take the question --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As a technical thing, if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me does $4 trillion account for $1.2 trillion --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it then negate it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t negate it.\xc2\xa0 These are policy decisions that policymakers have to make about where they think this country ought to go in terms of the policies we ought to adopt that will help grow the economy and deal with our fiscal challenges.\xc2\xa0 And there are a lot of decisions to be made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is helpful in this case is that the universe of options has been pretty thoroughly explored over the last several years as we\xe2\x80\x99ve had commissions and negotiations and budget proposals put forward.\xc2\xa0 And the consensus, the broad consensus that has emerged from this prolonged debate is that we need to take a balanced approach to this.\xc2\xa0 We need to deal with these challenges by cutting non-defense discretionary spending significantly, which the President has already agreed to do and signed into law.\xc2\xa0 We need to introduce reforms into our entitlement system that strengthen those programs and produce savings in health care.\xc2\xa0 And we need to increase revenues so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to deal with our deficit and debt in a way that puts all the burden on the middle class and senior citizens, because that\xe2\x80\x99s just not the right thing to do and it would be bad for our economy.\xc2\xa0 It would be bad to adopt a proposal that, lacking any other detail provided in it, would potentially cut investments in education and border security and all sorts of other programs -- innovation -- by something on the order of 19 percent.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These commission recommendations you keep talking about there\xe2\x80\x99s a consensus about -- President Obama has not endorsed any of them, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has through his actions and his proposals endorsed the balanced approach that is represented by the Simpson-Bowles Commission, by the Domenici-Rivlin Commission.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t support --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The numbers are not exactly the same.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, what is off --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support their recommendations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not all of them in their specifics, but\xc2\xa0 -- they have far greater defense cuts.\xc2\xa0 Does Paul Ryan support that?\xc2\xa0 They have far greater tax revenues.\xc2\xa0 These are just two areas where it -- you guys should be calling out folks who say, well, we should be supporting this commission, when, in fact, it includes proposals that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come near to with a 10-foot pole.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal actually proposed in his budget fewer defense cuts and fewer -- and less revenues than Simpson-Bowles.\xc2\xa0 Another example of his willingness to compromise.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the outline of what needs to be done is clear.\xc2\xa0 It has been clear for a long time.\xc2\xa0 It is supported broadly by the American people.\xc2\xa0 It is supported by Democrats, independents and Republicans, bipartisan commissions, graybeards, young academics, all sorts of experts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A Senate Democrat today agreed to vote to reject the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget.\xc2\xa0 I wondered what the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response is to that.\xc2\xa0 And what does it say that Democrats haven\xe2\x80\x99t proposed a budget in more than three years?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we prefer that the Senate and Congress overall function efficiently.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the vote that you referred to is yet another gimmick, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it will get the -- that the tally will come out the way it does.\xc2\xa0 It represents a decision by Republicans to, instead of acknowledging that the only solution here is a bipartisan solution, to sort of waste time with gimmicks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is an avenue here, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing and I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop waxing on about it, but the approach that we need to take is clear to everyone except apparently a significant portion of the Republicans in Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis, and then Ed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Secretary Geithner said this week, as you know, that Treasury possesses the tools on the debt ceiling to extend that probably into the new year to try to separate it from the lame duck session and another cliff.\xc2\xa0 So I just want to clarify -- is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s preference to try to extend it as far away from the December lame duck session as possible to keep those --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I would refer you to the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know enough -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall that specific statement by Treasury and I won\xe2\x80\x99t venture into the measures that Treasury takes in dealing with those kinds of situations as it did last year and as it has in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s preference is that Congress adopt a balanced approach to our deficit and debt challenges.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s been pretty transparent about that.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been pretty transparent about his willingness to accept cuts in programs that in a different situation he would rather not cut, but that represents a compromise.\xc2\xa0 He recognizes the need to introduce some reforms in Medicare and Medicaid so that we can strengthen those programs and ensure that those guarantees remain for our citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he also believes strongly that we need to make changes in our tax system so that it\xe2\x80\x99s more balanced, so that a middle class that was squeezed in the decade prior to the recession does not get further squeezed and burdened with the responsibility alone of resolving our deficit and debt challenges, but that the wealthiest Americans who -- as you know, you guys have all reported on this -- who, in that same period when the middle class saw its income stagnate or decline, saw its incomes increase dramatically.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that balanced approach is entirely sensible.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it has earned the support of so many outside observers, including former Republican office holders.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that\xe2\x80\x99s the way we have to go.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up on the "To-Do" list.\xc2\xa0 Can you remind us -- the President was not supportive of a House Republican version of tax cuts for small business earlier, and obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s something he\xe2\x80\x99s pushing today.\xc2\xa0 Can you just remind us, what is the gap between the Republican approach and the President\xe2\x80\x99s preferred approach?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve forgotten the specifics of some of the Republican proposals that you mention, but I think one of the concerns was that the need here is to boost job creation, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposals that he talked about today would reward small businesses for hiring -- for an increase in hiring, a specific benefit tied to job creation.\xc2\xa0 I think some of the proposals you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about were judged by outside independent economists as having not necessarily a positive near-term impact on job creation or economic growth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd also this is a fundamental difference here about\xc2\xa0 -- Republicans tend to identify law firm partners and hedge fund managers as small businesses.\xc2\xa0 We disagree.\xc2\xa0 So I think those small businessmen and women disagree.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s probably where some of the differences lie.</p>\n<p>\n\tEd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You said a moment ago it\'s up to Congress to adopt a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it also take presidential leadership for him at some point to say, we\'ve been kicking around all these plans since last summer -- Bowles-Simpson, et cetera, the Ryan budget -- you criticize one, they criticize the other -- doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it take presidential leadership to say, here\'s the plan, let\'s rally the Congress and the nation behind it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has done that.\xc2\xa0 He\'s put forward a plan that represents --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\'s just -- eight or nine plans are out there, but he hasn\'t rallied the country and said --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, the premise of your question is that -- is that presumably the President needs to compromise just like Congress needs to compromise, Republicans in the House need to compromise.\xc2\xa0 Is it not evidence of a willingness to compromise that this President, this Democratic President, has signed into law cuts in domestic, non-defense discretionary spending that bring that portion of the budget to its lowest level since Dwight Eisenhower?\xc2\xa0 Is that not evidence of a willingness to take seriously --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ve heard you say that, and every expert that has looked at that has said that\xe2\x80\x99s a drop in the bucket.\xc2\xa0 It\'s nice, it\'s a good start, but it\'s a drop in the bucket.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ironically, it\'s a drop in the -- it\'s especially a drop in the bucket if, as the House Republicans insist, you want to get all of your savings out of non-defense discretionary spending, you want to increase defense spending, you want to give more tax cuts to the wealthy and then you want to squeeze all the programs that include investments in education, border security, innovation, research and development.\xc2\xa0 That is not a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 That is not a -- not only is it not fair to middle-class Americans and seniors and others who would bear the burden of that approach, it\'s bad for the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhere do they think education fits into our economic future?\xc2\xa0 There was that moment of great clarity when the President was out on the road talking about the need to ensure that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- that Congress acted so that interest rates on student loans didn\xe2\x80\x99t double, and I think a spokesman for one of the House leaders said that the President was out there talking about education because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about the economy.\xc2\xa0 And it was a great moment of clarity because, as the President made clear, education is elemental to economic growth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEducation, especially in the 21st century, will be decisive in the competition to win the race for the strongest, most prosperous economy in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has given those speeches, but, as Jake was asking, what is the President going to do between now and the next six-and-a-half months to prevent this?\xc2\xa0 Because he can keep reading those talking points, Republicans can read their talking points --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\'s not reading the talking points.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re saying it\'s elemental and all of that, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, he\'s put forward a plan that represents and includes things that have already taken place in terms of signing into law significant spending cuts, significant entitlement reforms, and a plan that includes revenues -- an approach that has been endorsed by bipartisan commissions, by Democrats, independents and Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe question that you ask I think should be posed to leaders in Congress:\xc2\xa0 What are you going to do to demonstrate your willingness to compromise?\xc2\xa0 What steps will you take to prove that you\'re not simply pursuing an ideological agenda when the path here is so clear, the need for a balanced approach is so obvious, and yet the refusal to acknowledge that and adopt it is the obvious stumbling block here?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was this debt summit yesterday, and Alan Simpson, who\'s been talked about here, said that he knows for a fact that former President Clinton went to President Obama at some point in recent months and said, "for god sakes, you did this by executive order, you got 11 out of 18 votes; that\xe2\x80\x99s 60 percent."\xc2\xa0 And Alan Simpson said Clinton would have said, "I would wrap my arms around that thing and take it."\xc2\xa0 He would have.\xc2\xa0 And he claims Bill Clinton told that to President Obama.\xc2\xa0 Are you aware of that?\xc2\xa0 And what do you say when -- this is somebody that President Obama appointed, Alan Simpson -- even though he\'s a Republican -- to this commission, and he\'s saying, look, you\'re never going to get 100 percent; you got 60 percent.\xc2\xa0 As you said, Paul Ryan didn\xe2\x80\x99t even vote for it, but you got 60 percent.\xc2\xa0 Why not --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No House Republicans voted for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not wrap your arms around it -- he appointed them -- and say, here\'s the plan?\xc2\xa0 This is Alan Simpson talking.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, Ed.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I was not present for a conversation between former President Clinton and President Obama.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that former Senator Simpson was present for the conversation he recounts either.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the President appointed that commission, including its chairman, because when the President endorsed the idea legislatively, Republicans who had supported it in the past suddenly fled.\xc2\xa0 They decided not to support it, so it had to be an executive action -- because, once again, when the President endorsed it, the Republicans who had previously supported it decided they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the President\'s commission demonstrating his commitment to dealing with our fiscal challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe proposal that the Bowles-Simpson Commission put forward represents the balanced approach that the President took.\xc2\xa0 It is his proposal -- his budget is so much closer to the Bowles-Simpson proposal that you are celebrating in your question than the Ryan budget that the question that you need to ask is, why won\xe2\x80\x99t House Republicans in particular move closer to the Bowles-Simpson approach?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s the President.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he bring Bowles-Simpson up here to this podium and say, this is my plan, wrap his arms around him and say, let\xe2\x80\x99s go, Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Find me a House Republican plurality that will vote for the Bowles-Simpson that includes dramatically more significant --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Force it for a vote.\xc2\xa0 Have Harry Reid bring it up.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize -- you should ask the Speaker of the House to bring it up.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there was a Bowles-Simpson -- a version of Bowles-Simpson that came up, and I think 10 people in the Republican Party voted for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was the President\xe2\x80\x99s commission.\xc2\xa0 Ask the Democrats to bring it up for a vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure -- I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for the water there.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is, Ed, and we can debate this, but the fiscal commission the President created put forward a proposal that called for defense cuts, that called for nondefense discretionary cuts, that called for revenues, it called for entitlement reforms.\xc2\xa0 The levels are different in different areas, but the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget reflects that entirely.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Republican budget, the budget that has been put forward by Paul Ryan and embraced by Republicans across Capitol Hill and Republicans who want to be President does not represent that balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 The questions about why you don\xe2\x80\x99t support a balanced approach should be asked of Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoger.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Shift topics here toward G8 this weekend.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a report out that the U.S. is going to ask G8 for support for release of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no comment on the SPR.\xc2\xa0 I have no information to impart on that subject.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, a quick follow-up then.\xc2\xa0 Oil prices have been drifting down over the past two months -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of that.\xc2\xa0 Is it still critical to release oil at some point in the next month?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s another way of asking a question about the SPR that I have no information on for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last try.\xc2\xa0 Is the SPR on the agenda for G8?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the global economy is on the agenda for the G8.\xc2\xa0 The global oil market is part of the global economy, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that specifically that issue is on the agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m mixing it up.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re after NBC here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Going back to the meeting --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Dan, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I get in this peripheral thing where -- NBC, CNN -- go.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to the meeting -- some of the other topics that were discussed, did the President or congressional leaders find any common ground on the "To-Do" list on the bill to keep student loan rates low?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would hesitate to characterize what the leaders themselves said and I think you should ask them, but I think that, broadly speaking, based on my discussion with the President, that there was a constructive discussion about the initiatives that Congress could act on in the near future, and that included the President\xe2\x80\x99s "To-Do" list that he raised.\xc2\xa0 It included things like the VAWA, the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization.\xc2\xa0 It included the surface transportation bill and the need to take action on student loans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say there was an agreement to get a specific thing done on a specific day, but I think there was a healthy and positive discussion about the fact that there are many items on the agenda right now in the pipeline that represent opportunities to achieve some bipartisan successes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, there was no tangible agreement on any of these topics --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, in the end I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- Congress has to vote on legislation so it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- votes have to be taken, processes have to move forward.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it up to Congress to act, but there are a number of opportunities here for bipartisan cooperation.\xc2\xa0 The leaders discussed that.\xc2\xa0 The President discussed that with them.\xc2\xa0 And I think that it was noted in the room -- in the private dining room here off the Oval Office -- that there have been some bipartisan successes already between this Congress and the President.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is evidence against the otherwise prevailing consensus that nothing can get done, that actually things can get done if we put our minds to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, going back to Syria quickly, we started off -- the United States started off sort of engaging beyond the political realm when it comes to Syria.\xc2\xa0 Now, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve just stated, the United States is increasing its non-lethal assistance.\xc2\xa0 How would you specifically define where we stand right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Where we stand on Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We continue to be very concerned about the violence in Syria by the failure of the Assad regime to fulfill any of its obligations under the Kofi Annan plan.\xc2\xa0 We are concerned but not surprised that U.N. observers -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of this -- in Syria have faced incidents of violence while on the ground.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe onus remains on the regime to implement the elements of the Annan plan, all of them.\xc2\xa0 We have to give the Annan effort and the U.N. supervising mission in Syria a chance to succeed, because those efforts coupled with our ongoing -- and international efforts -- to increase pressure on the regime and support the opposition remain the best option for the political transition that Syrians so desperately want and deserve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how long do you give them a chance to succeed?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the violence is still continuing there.\xc2\xa0 At what point do you say this plan has failed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question -- and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been extremely blunt about the fact that we remain very skeptical of Assad\xe2\x80\x99s intentions.\xc2\xa0 We are working with our international partners through the "Friends of Syria" as well as at the United Nations and on the Security Council.\xc2\xa0 And we will, when appropriate and as necessary, discuss next steps.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we are now supporting the Annan plan, supporting that mission because it has brought about some positive developments, at the very least, a reduction, not an elimination, of violence.\xc2\xa0 And as I said, it embodies the best option here for the political transition that Syrians so desperately want.</p>\n<p>\n\tDan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on Kristen\xe2\x80\x99s question on the "To-Do" list.\xc2\xa0 You keep striking an optimistic tone and saying that this is something that Congress should act on.\xc2\xa0 But will they?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what are the chances that anything on that list will get done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me consult my magic eight ball here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think I am -- look, I can\'t guarantee, and no one should, that Congress will do one thing or the other.\xc2\xa0 What I do think has already been proven is that even in this environment, with this Congress, the capacity remains to pass legislation with bipartisan majorities.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that with the extension of the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that with the passage of the STOCK Act and the JOBS Act, with the recent passage of the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank -- which is not a huge thing, but an important piece of business that will help our exports to continue to grow and be a vibrant part of our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are steps that we can take with Congress to do the people\xe2\x80\x99s business.\xc2\xa0 And the list that the President put together contains a series of other initiatives that fall into that vein that represent the kinds of things that have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other things I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about -- VAWA reauthorization, resolving the student loan issue to ensure that millions of students across the country don\xe2\x80\x99t have their interest rates doubled on their student loans -- these are things that can be done.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m optimistic and the President is optimistic because they are so self-evidently necessary and achievable.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yet when you listen to folks up on the Hill or some of the pundits, there seems to be so much skepticism around this that anything will actually happen, and that this is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there is skepticism --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that won\xe2\x80\x99t get you anything.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there is skepticism about the ability to get some things done -- that remains I suppose skepticism about the ability of this Congress to tackle some of the big issues because they failed to do as recently as last fall when they had the super committee to deal with, the task assigned to them by the Budget Control Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it is a fact that this Congress, notwithstanding all the due skepticism and cynicism, extended the payroll tax cut, extended unemployment insurance, passed the STOCK Act and the JOBS Act.\xc2\xa0 And these are things the President supported and was able to sign into law.\xc2\xa0 And the other items that he put forward are similar in that they can enjoy bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think what your question elucidates is that while there are things that we obviously disagree on, even though that is the case, there are things that we can agree on.\xc2\xa0 And it is good for the American people, good for the American economy, good politics, I would suggest, for members of Congress to get some things done that will help the economy and help the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And another question on China and North Korea.\xc2\xa0 Just wondering if the White House has seen any evidence at all of China putting more pressure on North Korea to essentially change its ways, abandon any future nuclear tests.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have nothing new to report to you on that.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have ongoing consultations with the Chinese as well as others in the region and around the world about North Korea.\xc2\xa0 We have, as you know, because I\'ve discussed it in the past, as have others, encouraged the Chinese to use their influence with the North Koreans to affect their behavior, and that continues to be our position.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have anything new to report to you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said me.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Victoria, I said you.\xc2\xa0 I knew there was somebody -- I was trying to -- you are my last question.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the G8 summit, is the President going to encourage the Europeans to move away from austerity towards more of a growth strategy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the President\'s message to the Europeans and the position that he will bring to the G8 that he is hosting at Camp David is the same message that -- and position that he brought to Cannes for the G20, which is that -- we have been saying for some time now that growth has to be a factor in Europe, as I think the Secretary of State said, and a balanced approach that includes austerity, dealing with fiscal challenges as well as the need to grow the economy is the approach that we recommend, that we have adopted here.\xc2\xa0 And it has, in the United States, produced, as I\'ve been saying in answer to other questions, more than two years straight of economic growth and more than two years straight of private sector job creation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut that message is the same as it was in Cannes, and the President is in regular consultation with his European counterparts.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Geithner as well, as you know, has been working very closely with the Europeans.\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe that the -- we know that the Europeans have it within their capacity to deal with this challenge and that they have taken some important steps.\xc2\xa0 They need to take further steps to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What steps?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re not prescribing actions here, but I think that it\'s -- there are two areas here that need to be\xc2\xa0 -- that they have been addressing and will continue to address, which is the need to build the firewall that\'s necessary to meet the challenges posed there and to, in various countries, adopt the reforms that are necessary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the balanced approach that we\'ve talked about, that Secretary Clinton talked about today and Secretary Geithner and others have talked about in the past -- the President -- is one that we believe has worked here for us, is the right approach that you need to address the need for growth in Europe and the need to put people to work, including and especially young people in Europe.\xc2\xa0 And that I\'m sure will be, broadly speaking, the message the President will have when he meets with leaders at Camp David on Friday.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:27 P.M.
