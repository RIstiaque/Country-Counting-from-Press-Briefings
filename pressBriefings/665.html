Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:58 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House and to your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I had a couple of things I wanted to draw to your attention.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>First, today, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is making an important announcement about the funds and sites, and people who will help the 2 in 10 Americans who will be able to get insurance through the health insurance marketplaces starting on October 1st.</p>\n<p>Community health centers are a critical and local resource for Americans, and HHS is ensuring that they will have a key role in the process of enrollment.\xc2\xa0 1,159 health centers across the nation will receive $150 million in grant awards to help enroll uninsured Americans in new health coverage options made available by the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 These centers have committed to hiring an additional 2,900 outreach and eligibility assistance workers.\xc2\xa0 This means that in every state in the nation there will be people at community health centers available to help -- community health centers, rather, available to help.</p>\n<p>Here are a few examples of what this means in communities.\xc2\xa0 In Florida, a health center is hosting learning sessions at local libraries, churches, and civil organizations.\xc2\xa0 In Washington State, health centers are coordinating with local schools and libraries to let families know that they may be eligible for new insurance options.\xc2\xa0 A health center in Michigan is coordinating with a coalition of over 30 African American churches to get the word out and help sign people out.\xc2\xa0 In New Mexico and South Dakota -- this is my favorite -- health centers will be reaching individuals at summer and fall county fairs and rodeos to make sure they know about and sign up for the opportunities available to them in the new marketplaces.</p>\n<p>Secondly -- and I think I have a visual aid here to make this even more exciting -- here we go.\xc2\xa0 As you may have read about or received directly, this morning the White House released a report, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Economic Benefits of Fixing our Broken Immigration System,\xe2\x80\x9d detailing the key benefits to the U.S. economy that would result from signing the Senate bill into law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The economic costs of inaction are simply too high to delay.\xc2\xa0 Common-sense immigration reform would reduce the deficit, grow the economy, increase wages and increase productivity.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time for the House to act.</p>\n<p>And with that, I go to the Associated Press.\xc2\xa0 Josh.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 To start with Egypt, a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood appears to be growing, with prosecutors ordering the arrest of their Supreme Leader and other officials.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s call for a refrain from arbitrary arrests and a move towards reconciliation is essentially being ignored?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are in regular communication with the authorities in Egypt at a variety of levels.\xc2\xa0 We are working with our allies in the region to reinforce the message that we have been sending to those in Egypt about the need for Egypt to get off a path of polarization and move forward on a path of reconciliation.\xc2\xa0 Reconciliation means -- and a process, a democratic process or transition means that for it to work all groups and parties need to be at the table.\xc2\xa0 We have made clear that we oppose arbitrary arrests, and we continue to make that clear.</p>\n<p>But as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying all week, this is an extremely difficult and complicated situation.\xc2\xa0 There is a crisis in Egypt, and the way to move Egypt beyond crisis and towards a better future is for the authorities to embrace a process that is inclusive, that leads to a transition back to a civilian, democratically elected government, and that responds to the hopes and aspirations of the Egyptian people, of all the Egyptian people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how\xe2\x80\x99s that working out?\xc2\xa0 Do you see any indications that those -- (laughter).\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that it is apparent to any observer of the situation in Egypt that it is complex, it is difficult, and it is challenging not least, and perhaps most, for the Egyptian people themselves.</p>\n<p>We are under no illusions about the complexity of this challenge, nor are we under any illusions about the importance of this challenge, which is why we are making clear with our partners and allies, and directly, our views about the path that we believe Egypt needs to take moving forward so that it can return to a democratically elected civilian government.</p>\n<p>The alternative is chaos.\xc2\xa0 The alternative is a failure of Egypt to reach its potential, its enormous potential.\xc2\xa0 The alternative is sustained disappointment among the Egyptian people about the limitations placed on their own futures.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we are working with our partners and directly to make our views known; to provide assistance and guidance where we can; to make clear that we do not support any individual or any party or any group, we support a process that is inclusive and democratic; to make clear that we oppose all violence; to make clear that we call on the military to exercise maximum restraint; to make clear that it is unacceptable in our view, and certainly unhelpful, for any group or any party to incite violence.\xc2\xa0 And we are doing all this amidst an obviously very fluid situation and one that puts Egypt\xe2\x80\x98s future at stake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear that our determination about whether to call this a coup and some of the implications for aid will be dependent in part on how things work out going forward and what we see on the ground there.\xc2\xa0 So does the ongoing violence and these latest arrests move us closer to a determination that this was a coup d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are evaluating how the authorities are responding to and handling the current situation.\xc2\xa0 We will take our time and the time necessary to make the determinations regarding what happened last week and the change in leadership, the removal of President Morsi from power.\xc2\xa0 And we remain deeply concerned about the removal of President Morsi from power.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But what I\'ve said yesterday and I said the day before that remains true today, which is that we do not believe it is in the best interest of the United States to make immediate changes to our assistance programs, and there are consequences that come from the way that -- the manner in which we designate the events that happen in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And we are evaluating both what happened and our responsibilities under the law as we consult with Congress about next steps.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And briefly on immigration, with the House Republicans trying to figure out how they\'re going to move forward on this, will the President be stepping up his effort to urge Congress to -- the House to take up the Senate bill?\xc2\xa0 Or will he take kind of a more low-profile approach the way he did as the Senate bipartisan group was working their deal out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is keenly interested in seeing bipartisan legislation emerge from Congress that meets the standards that he laid forth two years ago, standards that are reflected in the bipartisan bill that was passed by the Senate, arrive on his desk for his signature.\xc2\xa0 And he is directly engaged in the effort to move that process forward and will continue to be.</p>\n<p>The release we put out today I think reflects the manner in which we are making clear the enormous benefits and the absolute need for comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 You have a coalition now of support behind us, a consensus of support behind comprehensive immigration reform reflected in the Senate bill that includes business leaders.\xc2\xa0 It includes faith leaders.\xc2\xa0 It includes law enforcement leaders, Democrats, Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have demonstrated in today\xe2\x80\x99s report the clear economic benefits of immigration reform, including the fact that the Senate bill would grow the economy by 5.4 percent -- this is all in the document that was over my shoulder and that you have access to -- would grow the economy by 5.4 percent over the next two decades due to a larger labor force, higher productivity, and more investments -- 5.4 percent.</p>\n<p>Productivity of labor and capital would increase by 1 percent over the next two decades.\xc2\xa0 Wages -- largely as a result of higher productivity -- real wages would rise by .5 percent in 2033, relative to current law, the equivalent of about an annual $250 increase today for a median household.</p>\n<p>Over the next 20 years -- and this is an issue that should be resonant with conservative Republicans who say they are very concerned about the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Over the next 20 years, federal deficits would be reduced by nearly $850 billion, just through comprehensive immigration reform -- not through a grand bargain; not through other means by which we are attempting to reduce the deficit, but through comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The federal debt would fall by 3 percentage points as a share of the economy by 2023, compared to current law.\xc2\xa0 And the solvency -- again, an issue that at least they claim, Republicans claim is important to them -- the solvency of the Social Security trust fund would be extended by two years, and the 75-year shortfall would be reduced by nearly half a trillion dollars.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The benefits are clear.\xc2\xa0 The fact that there is a broad bipartisan consensus behind this is clear.\xc2\xa0 It cannot be acceptable broadly and in the long term that immigration reform would be blocked because some minority of House Republicans is concerned about a primary challenge from the far right.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a good argument.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not a good argument politically, it\'s certainly not a good argument economically.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seemed like an uphill battle in the House, Jay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s always been an uphill battle.\xc2\xa0 Hard things are hard.\xc2\xa0 This is coming to pass now because there is finally a consensus that has been built around it.\xc2\xa0 We are now at a point that would have been impossible, frankly, if President Obama hadn\'t been reelected.\xc2\xa0 The position held officially by the leader of the Republican Party in 2012 was that the answer to immigration reform was self-deportation.</p>\n<p>We\'ve seen enormous progress since then.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen a change in views across the board.\xc2\xa0 But the work remains.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve said all along that getting legislation through both houses of Congress would be very difficult.\xc2\xa0 The road ahead is littered with obstacles, and we have to navigate our way through them and around them and over them -- but we will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you persuade Speaker Boehner to take it up?\xc2\xa0 How long do you have to do it?\xc2\xa0 And does this issue instead simply become something for the midterms?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we believe that there is an enormous amount of momentum behind and consensus behind comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 We are doing everything we can to engage in persuasion, making the arguments.\xc2\xa0 Stakeholders are making the argument, including stakeholders with very close ties to Republican leaders and Republican rank-and-file members.\xc2\xa0 The business community has made clear its views on the need for comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 The law enforcement community has made clear its views on the need for comprehensive immigration reform, and those efforts will continue.</p>\n<p>But in the end, we can\'t prevent lawmakers from making bad choices.\xc2\xa0 We can simply be part of a broad, comprehensive effort of persuasion that makes a case for why passing comprehensive immigration reform is the right thing to do for the economy, for our businesses, for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the moral thing to do, and we\'ll keep at it and we\'ll get it done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know the President has been working behind the scenes.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to launch some high-profile effort, similar to like the health care overhaul, for instance, to try to drum up support?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The thing about strategy is that it would be strategically foolish to announce it in advance.\xc2\xa0 So we are on this every day.\xc2\xa0 We\'re very much engaged in a process that -- led by the Gang of Eight, that resulted in the successful bipartisan passage of comprehensive immigration reform -- an effort that saw compromise.\xc2\xa0 It is not a bill that is written word for word the way the President would write it, or probably the way any individual member of the Gang of Eight would have written it.</p>\n<p>It contains substantial increases in resources for border enforcement.\xc2\xa0 As Senator McCain said and I paraphrase, anyone who claims that the reason to vote against this bill now is because it\'s not strong enough in border enforcement is not serious about border security, because there has never been legislation this strong on border security.\xc2\xa0 And it comes at a time when we\'ve never -- we haven\'t made strides as significant as we\'ve made in the last five years in border security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You know the statistics -- the doubling of Border Patrol agents.\xc2\xa0 All the metrics that measure our progress on border security demonstrate the improvements that we\'ve seen.\xc2\xa0 But the President always made clear that one of the key criteria that he would insist upon when it came to passage of immigration reform would be enhanced and increased border security.\xc2\xa0 And that is present in abundance in the Senate bill.</p>\n<p>So we\'re just going to keep at this, Steve.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that there is an overwhelming case for why this is the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>Because last time I think we did almost 45 minutes on the front row, I\'m going to move it around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Yes, Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just to follow up on what Steve was asking you, there are House Republicans who say that it annoys them to a great extent when the President goes out and campaigns for immigration reform or some other element of his agenda.\xc2\xa0 They call it "campaigning," right?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As opposed to when they go out and advocate for their policy positions.\xc2\xa0 I know that it annoys them that he is in office.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s just accept that and posit that.\xc2\xa0 But this isn\'t about him.\xc2\xa0 The reason why we have the progress that we\'ve seen is in no small measure because of the support the President has put behind comprehensive immigration reform, in no small measure because of the advocacy he engaged in throughout the campaign and throughout his first term.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But it is not about him.\xc2\xa0 We wouldn\'t be where we are with the kind of bill that emerged from the Senate if it weren\'t for the support of business leaders and law enforcement leaders and faith leaders and Republicans both in office and in the political profession who understand that this is the right thing to do economically, morally and politically.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to finish my question --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m fired up today, Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So because part of the Senate strategy was -- and members of the President\'s own party suggested that he stand back and let it proceed on its own, are there limits to the President\'s bully pulpit on this issue?\xc2\xa0 Has he discovered that that is the case on this particular issue, both in the Senate and the House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think every issue is different.\xc2\xa0 And, of course, there are limits to the powers of the bully pulpit on every issue.\xc2\xa0 This is a methodical effort, using all the tools available to us and to him, using all the tools available to advocates and lawmakers who support immigration reform to get this done.\xc2\xa0 And he is an important part of it, but it\'s bigger than he is.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s the right thing to do for the country.</p>\n<p>I mean, this is the irony -- and I hung up my spurs as a political analyst a while ago, but I\'ve seen what, broadly speaking, you have written, you and the press and others about the political stakes here.\xc2\xa0 And the President\'s interest is in getting comprehensive immigration reform that a lot of Republicans seem to think is the right thing to do for the future of the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 But he is not in it for political reasons.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s in it because it\'s the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>And Democrats are supporting this effort because it\'s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 And, increasingly, we\'ve seen Republicans back this effort, as Senator McCain long has, as former President George W. Bush long has, and the Republican members of the Gang of Eight -- Marco Rubio and Jeff Flake and Lindsey Graham and McCain -- long have, because it\'s the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one quick ACA question?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To clarify what you were describing earlier about HHS\'s initiative with community health centers, if I remember correctly there was reporting recently about trying to pull back on the funding to community health centers to find the resources to help do the rollout and implementation.\xc2\xa0 And I just want to clarify, the $150 million that you\'re talking about, is that new money or is that just a new task given to the community health centers?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My guess is that the details on this would best be answered at the Department of HHS.\xc2\xa0 But this is part of an effort to inform the public about the benefits and opportunities available to them through a law that was passed, signed by the President, and upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>Now, there is a nihilistic effort going on to undermine a law, the law of the land, that is embodied in the near 40 efforts to repeal it -- futile efforts to repeal it in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s the law and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be implemented.\xc2\xa0 And those who oppose it, those who try to undermine it at every step need to be made aware of the fact that what they are saying is that the benefits that have already been enjoyed, are already being enjoyed by the American people, they want to take away.\xc2\xa0 The opportunities and benefits that will become available to millions of Americans, they want to take away in the name of partisan political victory.</p>\n<p>But this has been -- they can present legislation to amend it and see how it fares; they can present legislation of their own for health care reform.\xc2\xa0 But instead, we just see efforts to undermine it.\xc2\xa0 And that would be one thing if it existed only in a political vacuum, but there are consequences to this.\xc2\xa0 And those who suffer the consequences are the American people who are being told by opponents that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to lose their benefits if the opponents get there way, that they would rather have insurance companies dictating whether they can take you off your insurance policy, kick you off, or say, I won\'t give you insurance because you have a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the way the world existed before the Affordable Care Act was passed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that, Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You can when I get to you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, this morning we saw the Senate Health Committee advance the Employment Non-Discrimination Act with the votes of three Republican senators -- Senator Murkowski, Kirk, and Hatch.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what role the White House plans to play in the coming weeks and months to help build the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the question, and I think I put out a statement about this not long before the briefing.\xc2\xa0 We welcome the passage by the committee of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, the bipartisan support that it saw, the Republican senators who voted for it -- Senator Kirk, who was a leader in the effort.\xc2\xa0 This reflects the strategy the President has long believed is the right one when it comes to these matters, and we\'ll continue to press for broader support in the Senate and then in the House on this issue, as my statement said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you refer to strategy, do you still believe -- do you think that the executive order for federal contractors would help or hinder that effort?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our position on the executive order hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed and our position on the executive order has been coupled with our belief that the best way to do this is to pursue legislation that\'s broad and comprehensive.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what ENDA is.\xc2\xa0 And we are -- I mean, today is a good day in this narrative.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a good day because the committee passed it, and it passed it with Republican support.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll take that and we\xe2\x80\x99ll move forward and hope we can get more progress.</p>\n<p>Jon -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Dan, then Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Egypt.\xc2\xa0 If the White House ultimately decides to call what happened there a military coup, does that automatically guarantee that the aid, the $1.5 billion in aid will be cut off?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would say is that we are reviewing a legal framework here.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly an issue that has been noted in questions here and written much about and discussed on television about.\xc2\xa0 So when I talked yesterday about the elephant in the room, there are serious consequences here to our evaluation of and ultimate decision about the designation we\xe2\x80\x99ll make.</p>\n<p>And they go beyond the dollar figure associated with our aid to Egypt because of our longstanding partnership with Egypt, our longstanding support for the Egyptian people, and the role that we play and can play in the region when it comes to offering advice and counsel on a democratic transition.\xc2\xa0 So all of these matters go into our thought process as we evaluate the legal framework here, our legal obligations, as well as we make our consultations with Congress on this matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the label itself doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen others who are opine about the \xe2\x80\x9cif this happens, then this happens\xe2\x80\x9d aspect of the way the law and rules are written, but I would refer you to them for that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously treating this very cautiously because we believe that\'s in the best interest of our national security and our support for Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s transition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because of the critical role that Egypt has played in the region, strategically, militarily, is there a concern that the longer that there\xe2\x80\x99s instability there, that this is something that could spill over and impact the region as a whole?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think as a general matter the answer to that question is, yes.\xc2\xa0 That has been true with the unrest in general, especially the violent unrest that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in different parts of the Middle East during this period of upheaval.</p>\n<p>And there are no positive outcomes to a continued violent crisis in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we call so strongly for a cessation of violence, why we call so strongly for an inclusive process that is peaceful, and where reconciliation is the goal and compromise is the means to achieving the goal.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we believe is necessary in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the Egyptian people, broadly speaking, support that process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And in all the ways that we can, we are trying to impart that message and to be of assistance in the process, understanding all along that this is a process that will be designed and determined and decided by the Egyptian people, including the outcome of that process -- who the leaders are, what the constitution says, what parties are represented.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the best way to getting from here to there for the sake of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s future and the sake of the millions of young Egyptians in that country is one that is inclusive and that allows for participation by all individuals and all parties.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Snowden case, any recent effort to put additional pressure on Russia to prevent him from going to Venezuela?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have, as I said the other day, engaged with all the countries that might be transit points or endpoints, including Russia, where we believe Mr. Snowden currently remains, about our view that he should not be allowed to engage in further international travel with the exception of the travel necessary to be returned here to the United States where he faces serious felony charges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I have nothing new to report in our communications -- about our communications with Russia.\xc2\xa0 They are as they were, which is our shared belief that we don\'t want this issue to disrupt our important and broad relationship with Russia, but that we believe that there is firm legal justification through cooperation along the usual law enforcement channels for his expulsion from Russia and return to the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you still communicating with Russia?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we communicate with Russia all the time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 About this and other -- many other topics.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Jay, on Egypt you said you were evaluating whether or not this was a coup, and you don\'t know how long it\'s going to take.\xc2\xa0 But help me understand the process here.\xc2\xa0 At the end of this evaluation, are you going to come out here and say, yes, it was a coup; no, it wasn\'t a coup?\xc2\xa0 How is this going to work?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what\'s happening in Egypt is so serious and compelling in the sense that it is -- it merits extreme attention right now, that jumping ahead to what a process like this will look like when it is decided skips ahead of some very serious days and steps that we can take as a matter of policy, and also that we will see unfold in Egypt as each day passes.\xc2\xa0 And we can evaluate whether or not the Egyptian authorities are making progress towards a transition to democracy, progress that includes not just asserting that there will be elections or constitutional amendments, but a process that demonstrably reflects an effort to engage all parties and one that reflects an effort to resist violence and instead engage in negotiation.</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timeline for you.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to paint a picture of what that looks like, because frankly, we don\'t know yet what the result of that process will look like.\xc2\xa0 I think a far more significant development will be what happens actually in Egypt, which will, in part, inform how we make our determinations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you will make a determination specifically on that question -- coup or not a coup?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I expect that, as I\'ve said, that we will take the time necessary to make that evaluation.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure there will be an endpoint, but I don\'t have a timeline for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then on the health care, the issue of the employer mandate being delayed a year, under what authority did the White House decide to implement that law a year later than the law itself calls for?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\'s been a law passed by the Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, there are experts a plenty who can provide the specifics for you on this, both inside and outside the government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because the Democratic chairman of the Senate Health Committee said you have no authority.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I highly recommend picking up any issue of the Federal Register and finding in it examples of rules and waivers and that sort of thing.\xc2\xa0 This is not an unusual process.\xc2\xa0 And this reflects an effort that the hue and cry, the calamitous hollering that you hear is reflective of a political and partisan effort to undermine --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about Tom Harkin.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, you\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about Tom Harkin.\xc2\xa0 You\'re talking about the Republican effort to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tom Harkin said you had no authority to do this.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- to complain about the -- listening to business -- to postpone a deadline that affects 4 percent of businesses with 50 or more employees, when they\xe2\x80\x99ve done everything they can to undermine the law from day one.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t want to see it implemented.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve made that clear.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\'re listening -- we\'re being --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tom Harkin wants this implemented, but on --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, you can pretend this is about Tom Harkin, but you know it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is this is -- we have demonstrated, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, that we will make improvements where those improvements make sense; we will be flexible in its implementation where being flexible makes sense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mean, everybody recently, to their credit, who\xe2\x80\x99s written about this has noted the comparison here to the passage of Medicare Part D, which was an initiative, a top priority of President George W. Bush when it came to domestic policy.\xc2\xa0 And it passed, and a lot of Democrats opposed it, but it passed.\xc2\xa0 And Democrats did not, once it passed, engage in efforts to undermine it every step of the way.\xc2\xa0 Instead they, once it became law, engaged in an effort to make sure that the American people, the people they represented, enjoyed the benefits of the law.</p>\n<p>And I expect that most constituents who potentially would get insurance for the first time in their lives, or the first time in a long time -- if they are made aware of the possibility of enrolling in these marketplaces -- would expect that their representatives, their senators, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re Democratic or Republican, would help them in that process, rather than doing everything they can to prevent their constituents from enjoying the benefits of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what do you say to Republicans that say on the issue of immigration that if the White House can simply decide to delay implementation of certain aspects of bills that passed, that you won\xe2\x80\x99t delay implementation of the border security?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 People who suggest that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything unusual about the delaying of a deadline in the implementation of a complex and comprehensive law are deliberately sticking their heads in the sand, or are just willfully ignorant about past precedent.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not serious.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we are going about the business of implementing this law, and we\'re going about the business of implementing it in a way that maximizes the benefits available to the American people, that minimizes the difficulties in the implementation process for business as well as individuals.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to keep at it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You reeled off earlier in this lengthy briefing a long list of things that the Egyptians need to do --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not lengthy yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- yet there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing them.\xc2\xa0 And it seems the only leverage that the United States has is the aid.\xc2\xa0 So are you going to wait for them to do these things before you decide to pull the aid?\xc2\xa0 Never mind the issue of the coup.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand the sort of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Never mind the issue of the coup.\xc2\xa0 How long is it going to take?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I commend you for waiting five days until we\'ve declared the end of a process that will be long, indeed, and has been long since this historic transformation began in Egypt, and it has not been, as we\'ve seen recently, without enormous challenges and setbacks and loss of life.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is not a matter for political back-and-forth or five-day deadlines alone.\xc2\xa0 It is a matter for serious and cautious implementation of policy that\'s in the best interest of the United States and the best interest of the American people, and -- because that is our policy objective -- in the best interest long term of the Egyptian people.</p>\n<p>So we\'re not going to rush to make determinations that could have serious consequences and impacts in our ability to help bring about a positive result here in a very difficult and challenging situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ll just keep telling them what they ought to do?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill, in your view, we either have influence or we don\'t.\xc2\xa0 And we are using the influence that we have and the advice that we can offer, and the collaboration with allies and partners that we can bring about, to help the Egyptian people and the Egyptian authorities proceed along a path towards democracy and the restoration of democratically elected civilian government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'ll see how that process works out.\xc2\xa0 But our focus is on reaching a desired result that\'s in the interest of the United States and in the interest of the Egyptian people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You also spoke earlier in this briefing about the change in views, the change in momentum on the immigration issue.\xc2\xa0 And yet, if you look at the Republican caucus, the percentage of Hispanics in those districts is about 10 percent on average, and most of them have at least three-quarters of the population of their voters as white people.\xc2\xa0 I mean, where are you going to make progress there?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly -- I assume you\'re not suggesting that Anglos or that white people don\'t support immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s ample evidence to the contrary, A.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m suggesting that there is no price to pay for most of those members --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to leave the political analysis to others, you, but also to Republican political professionals who have made the analysis about the potential highly negative long-term effect of opposing immigration reform on the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think that if you talk to the business community and the law enforcement community and the faith community about immigration reform, communities that have strong relationships with Republican leaders and Republican rank-and-file members in the Republican Party, you will hear support for immigration reform on the merits, the substantive policy merits, as well as when it comes to the political implications.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\'s what I said earlier.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if, as I\'ve seen, the issue here is whether a handful of Republicans in certain districts are worried about getting challenged from the far right and that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the reason why Republicans block comprehensive immigration reform, with all its benefits to the economy, with all its benefits to our businesses and all its benefits to our people across the country, that will be a choice they make.\xc2\xa0 But we don\'t believe in the end that that\'s the choice that will be made.\xc2\xa0 We believe that comprehensive immigration reform can and will become law.</p>\n<p>Wendell, it\xe2\x80\x99s your turn.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you make of Senator Harkin\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the President does not have the authority to delay implementation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that\'s obviously not the case.\xc2\xa0 I would refer --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is obviously not the case?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The ability to postpone the deadline is clear and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President ask for a ruling from counsel -- the White House Counsel?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wendell, again, I invite you to read the Federal Register and all the examples of -- I know that would be a lot to ask, but the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to ask of me.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, but the fact of the matter is this is not unusual, and it is done -- it is evidence of the kind of flexibility and deference to the concerns and interests of, in this case, a small percentage of American businesses with more than 50 employees that you would think Republicans would support.\xc2\xa0 Because you know and I know that their concern is not that we delay the implementation of an aspect of this law, one provision of it -- it\xe2\x80\x99s that they want to try everything they can to undermine the implementation of this law and the reception by the American people of the benefits that they would gain from this law -- even though it has been passed by both houses of Congress, it has been signed into law by the President, and has been upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>So the issue here is the ongoing political efforts reflected in the roughly 40 votes to repeal that we\'ve seen in the House of Representatives, as if there were no other issues that they could be working on.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s just not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not serious and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect -- what you don\'t hear from Republicans is, you know what, this is what we should be doing to reform our health care system, to provide security to the American people who worry about getting kicked off their insurance, security to young Americans who want the ability, as the Affordable Care Act affords them, to stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 insurance policy.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t hear that from Republicans.\xc2\xa0 All they say is do away with Obamacare because it\xe2\x80\x99s Obamacare.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you about a Democrat who says you cannot delay that provision of the law.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know you and Jon are pretending that this is about a Democrat.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I have not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t take Tom Harkin seriously?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We absolutely do, but I\xe2\x80\x99m -- what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying we --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He expressed concern --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we will have conversations with Senator Harkin, but the fact of the matter is we are confident that the ability to postpone a deadline is available to and clear in the implementation of this law.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we will have conversations with senators who are seriously interested in the implementation of the law.</p>\n<p>What we do not take seriously is the ongoing nihilistic efforts by Republicans to undermine a law that has been signed and upheld by the Supreme Court, an effort that has the result of -- if it were to be successful -- of depriving millions and millions of Americans of access to insurance and the benefits that are available to them through the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jay, on the question of trust, a lot of House Republicans are telling us -- Eric Cantor has been talking about this, Tom Cole and others -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s a trust problem.\xc2\xa0 They do not trust this President to implement border security for a pathway to citizenship.\xc2\xa0 They want something more concrete.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re worried about this health mandate decision, basically saying that why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he just suspend the eVerify mandate, for example.\xc2\xa0 What can you do to -- what can the President do to get that trust gap closed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, this is coming from people who have voted 40 times to repeal the entire law, so let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear about that.\xc2\xa0 There is not an interest in implementing Obamacare among House Republican leaders.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have to take it from me, just listen to what they\xe2\x80\x99ve said, right?\xc2\xa0 So this is not a serious concern of theirs.\xc2\xa0 They are trying to make some -- trying to gain some political traction out of the simple deferment of a deadline for one aspect of the Affordable Care Act in response to the concerns of business as we implement the rest of the law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, these Republicans are talking about immigration --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And you used health care as an example in the broad issue of trust.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They are using it --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When it comes to immigration reform, true or untrue:\xc2\xa0 Has by every metric reasonably put forward by experts on this issue border security improved under President Obama?\xc2\xa0 The answer is true.\xc2\xa0 Yes, it has.</p>\n<p>So the President has demonstrated through deed, not just words, his commitment to enhanced border security.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s happened.\xc2\xa0 And he has demonstrated by his support for the enormous increase in resources for even greater enhancement of border security placed into the Senate immigration reform bill that he supports even further improvements in our border security.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\'s just a fact.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you can pretend that it\xe2\x80\x99s not because you want to find a way to do the wrong thing, or you can acknowledge the progress that\'s been made on border security as Senator McCain has said.\xc2\xa0 Senator McCain has said anybody who is out there claiming that there is not enough border security in the Senate bill is not really concerned about border security because it\xe2\x80\x99s just not true.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you ensure that Republicans who are worried about this, who are bringing up the health mandate, that the President would enforce on time the new eVerify mandate, other border security measures?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President supports the Senate immigration bill.\xc2\xa0 He supports -- the bill represents the priorities that he put forward two years ago.\xc2\xa0 And one of the top four priorities that he insisted be in any comprehensive immigration reform bill was enhanced border security.\xc2\xa0 So, absolutely, he would do everything he can, as he has for the first four and a half years of his presidency, to enhance our border security.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s got the record to prove it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re also worried about an immigration where he\xe2\x80\x99s not enforcing the law with regard to young immigrants.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, they either are for immigration reform or they\'re not.\xc2\xa0 They\'re either for it or they\'re not.\xc2\xa0 The bipartisan group in the Senate worked extremely hard on this effort through a process of compromise and collaboration.\xc2\xa0 And what we saw was a piece of legislation, in an environment that is very difficult when it comes to political polarization, clear the Senate with a substantial bipartisan majority.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\'t happen every day on these big issues, as you know.\xc2\xa0 And if they believe that Marco Rubio isn\xe2\x80\x99t serious about border enforcement, and John McCain and Jeff Flake and all the other Republicans who worked on this and voted for it in the Senate, then they ought to say so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is a serious bill that represents bipartisan compromise, the kind of bipartisan compromise that the American people say they want out of Washington.\xc2\xa0 And it has the backing of business, it has the backing of the faith communities, it has the backing of law enforcement.\xc2\xa0 It provides enormous economic benefits to the American people, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>I think I said Anita.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two issues.\xc2\xa0 First I wanted to ask you about the insider threat program, which the administration -- which would stem from an executive order in 2011.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is one of your things where you ask me, like, it\xe2\x80\x99s a stump the Press Secretary question?\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s been written about.\xc2\xa0 I asked you about it a couple of weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 You were unfamiliar.\xc2\xa0 I assumed that you would familiarize yourself with it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I went to Africa, but go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I went to Africa, too.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I wondered if the President would be -- I have a second question.\xc2\xa0 But on the first, I just wondered if the President believes that having federal workers spy on each other will prevent national security leaks, as this program calls for, particularly when --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Anita, I confess that I did not go read the McClatchy story.\xc2\xa0 I promise I will do that and I\xe2\x80\x99ll have some sort of response to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just us.\xc2\xa0 Others have written --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there is.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read those stories.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter about the story.\xc2\xa0 Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xc2\xa0 Skip the story.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But again, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me a question based on a program that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But hold on, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to respond to -- to comment on a program that I just haven\xe2\x80\x99t spent a lot of time reading about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But forget the story.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to comment on a program that\xe2\x80\x99s an administration program.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, and I confess, even though you and I both went to Africa, that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t educated myself on it.\xc2\xa0 So I would rather not respond.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She stumped you.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 She stumped me.\xc2\xa0 She got me.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I stumped you.\xc2\xa0 Well, now I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask you a second question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dinner for two.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is that what the price is?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Usually.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I assume I get another question since you didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer that one.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I did answer it honestly, which is I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer for you right now.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Switching gears to immigration, when the President saw President Bush in Africa, I know that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak publicly.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, President Bush spoke today about immigration -- obviously, you probably were in favor of those comments.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s now spoken twice in the last week.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if they had talked about that or if they -- in his interview?\xc2\xa0 I wondered if they\xe2\x80\x99d spoken about that, or if that was something that they both sort of talked about he might do that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 President Obama and President Bush did speak before they appeared at the -- for the moment of silence at the embassy in Tanzania.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout of the contents of that conversation, but they did have a conversation prior to that public appearance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you know that they were -- he was going to speak about immigration?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I read about it in the press, so -- yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just following up quickly on that, does the President think that former President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s comments today may have helped move the needle forward to pressure House Republicans to act on immigration reform?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, President Bush speaks for himself, and his comments today reflect his long support, I believe, for immigration reform done well.\xc2\xa0 I think he said that the system doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, the system is broken, and it needs to be fixed.\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a position he has long held, to his credit, and that he pushed for as President.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve long noted in our effort for immigration reform that two of the most prominent Republicans out there -- the former President and the former nominee for President, John McCain and George W. Bush -- are high-profile advocates, and have been, for comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what impact anybody\xe2\x80\x99s comments about it and about the merit of immigration reform will have, I think, remains to be seen or can be evaluated by you and your colleagues.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly welcome everyone\xe2\x80\x99s comments in support of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I want to go back to ENDA for a moment.\xc2\xa0 The President is working on immigration reform, the student loan bill.\xc2\xa0 Where does getting ENDA passed fall on his list of legislative priorities?\xc2\xa0 How much urgency will he bring to it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have long supported past -- well, I mean, we have long supported comprehensive nondiscrimination legislation that is reflected in what the bill that passed the Senate committee today.\xc2\xa0 And I think our support is helpful to that process, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to push it forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we see the type of public statements that we saw, for example, today on immigration reform?\xc2\xa0 What will he do specifically to get this -- to the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, as I said earlier, if you talk about your strategy in advance, you\xe2\x80\x99re not a very good strategist.\xc2\xa0 So we have supported it.\xc2\xa0 We have made our support clear for it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work with Congress in the effort to translate that support into law, to work to build on the bipartisan passage out of committee of ENDA legislation, and hopefully that process will result in a law that the President can sign.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if the President believes in this, why not sign the executive order and put more pressure on Republicans to act?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this all along, that the President believes and we believe that as we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at this, that the best path forward was through comprehensive -- more comprehensive legislation, and that is the path we\xe2\x80\x99ve been on and which we believe has helped achieve the passage with bipartisan support through a committee today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The people who support the executive order and this legislation would say that in the meantime, while this is going through Congress --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- members of the LGBT community are being discriminated against.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Kristen, I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve been here when I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered the question at least a half dozen or a dozen times.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mean, we understand that and we have had the position we\xe2\x80\x99ve had.\xc2\xa0 And that position -- some criticism of that has been, well, there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be progress on ENDA, but in fact we did see progress today, and we welcome that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re a long way from the end here, but we welcome the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen today.</p>\n<p>April, I did say -- yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jay, the President yesterday and today is basically meeting with his base.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat singing to the choir on immigration reform with the CBC and CHC.\xc2\xa0 But what is he asking them to do when it comes to this?\xc2\xa0 Because it seems like the efforts before have not, I guess, garnished any types of passages yet.\xc2\xa0 What is he asking them to do?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the -- I think two things.\xc2\xa0 The contents of the conversations he had yesterday and today are not limited to immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 But every voice that supports this that\xe2\x80\x99s expressed out there helps the cause.\xc2\xa0 And he welcomes the efforts of lawmakers in the House who actively support immigration reform and want to see the House act on it and act on it soon.\xc2\xa0 So that -- I think that reflects what he was asking House members in these meetings to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I think you\xe2\x80\x99re right, for those who support it, he is preaching to the choir here.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of helpful advocacy by Democratic House members, and we think that is useful to the cause of getting this done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So since you said that the meetings were not limited to immigration and you announced the stakeout with the CHC folks, what happened in the CHC meeting?\xc2\xa0 What was said?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was not in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I know that this was one of the topics that they discussed.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they talked about other issues.\xc2\xa0 I know yesterday with the CBC they talked about minimum wage and ways to move forward on jobs and the economy, in addition to immigration reform and some other issues.\xc2\xa0 This was -- these meetings are not limited to one legislative agenda item.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, with the internal readout -- I know some of your people were in the meeting -- did they say that, like the CBC, was it --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t know that we put out an internal readout yet.\xc2\xa0 But when we do, we\'ll try to include all the topics that they discussed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I just wanted to find out --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I wasn\'t in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 So I just haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten -- before I came in here, I didn\'t get a readout.\xc2\xa0 Although I\'m going to go out on a limb and say that immigration reform was discussed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wow.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Pretty good, right?\xc2\xa0 Did you -- all right, I\'ll do the last one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tremendous apprehension in Israel, obviously -- in Israel, over the Egyptian situation.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen the President\'s conversations with Qatar, with UAE.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen no conversation with Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 Can we expect a conversation, high level?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we have an enormously close and cooperative and collaborative relationship with Israel, both with regards to our bilateral relationship, but we are in constant communication with the Israelis about all the events in the broader region.\xc2\xa0 And you can be sure that those contacts and those discussions are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a presidential-level communication to preview for you.\xc2\xa0 But as I think I\'ve said in the past, there is no leader with whom he has met or spoken more often with than Prime Minister Netanyahu since President Obama has been in office.\xc2\xa0 I certainly expect those conversations to continue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions if you\'d indulge me.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, last two.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The first one is the Egyptian Ambassador, the U.S. Ambassador to Egypt, Anne Patterson, has become something of a lightning rod there.\xc2\xa0 Does she still enjoy the President\'s full confidence?\xc2\xa0 Does he believe that she is still an effective advocate for U.S. interests in Egypt?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, yes.\xc2\xa0 She is an excellent career diplomat, has served admirably in a variety of posts prior to Egypt and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 She is doing a great job.\xc2\xa0 And I think that what some of -- the suggestion that an ambassador to a country by engaging with the government is somehow picking sides misunderstands the function that ambassadors serve.\xc2\xa0 Of course, Ambassador Patterson engaged with the Egyptian government that was led by President Morsi.\xc2\xa0 That\'s part of her job.</p>\n<p>And she is engaging with the authorities in power now.\xc2\xa0 And she\'ll engage with the authorities in power now.\xc2\xa0 And she\'ll engage with what we hope will be the next democratically elected civilian government when that government is in place.\xc2\xa0 She is an expert in the area and a supremely skilled diplomat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then also on Egypt, you\'ve made the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position on aid very clear.\xc2\xa0 However, reports are that there are four F-16s that are due to be delivered in the near future to Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration believe that you should move ahead with the schedules as they were planned before this upheaval happened, or would you massage schedules at least until you know what kind of government is going to be flying those jets?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the broader question of aid, you\'re correct that it\'s our view that we should not hastily change our aid programs.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of the schedule for delivery of certain assistance.\xc2\xa0 I certainly haven\'t heard of any changes, but I would also ask the Defense Department.\xc2\xa0 But our general position is that as we evaluate the very fluid situation in Egypt and as we impress upon the Egyptian authorities our belief that they need to make progress towards a transition back to a civilian, democratically elected government, and that they need to do so in an inclusive way that allows for participation by all parties and individuals, we will evaluate those circumstances as we look at designations and their impact on our assistance programs.\xc2\xa0 But on the specific delivery of specific items, I would ask the Defense Department.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have I stumped you on this?\xc2\xa0 Do I get dinner for two as well?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, dinner for everyone.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 At McDonald\'s.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Take care.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:53 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
