b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>* The President will depart the White House to Camp David mid-afternoon on Sunday.</p>\n<p>** On Thursday in Denver, Colorado, the President will deliver remarks at a fundraiser to benefit Senator Bennet. He will then travel to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he will attend a DNC fundraiser on Thursday night.</p>\n<p>12:58 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do a couple -- one announcement and the week ahead before we get started.</p>\n<p>President Obama called former President Nelson Mandela this morning to congratulate him on the 20th anniversary of his release from prison.\xc2\xa0 President Obama expressed the American people\xe2\x80\x99s great admiration for President Mandela, who was very appreciative of the call.</p>\n<p>Next, let\xe2\x80\x99s do a quick week ahead.\xc2\xa0 On Sunday -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 On Sunday the President will travel to Camp David.\xc2\xa0 He will return to the White House on Monday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have times for that, roughly?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, but we will -- let me get that* -- are you pool duty?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just curious.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they doing anything for Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will inquire.\xc2\xa0 I will assume that will be up there at Camp David.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday the President will visit and tour a jobs training center in the capital region.\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday the President will meet with King Juan Carlos of Spain at the White House.\xc2\xa0 On Thursday the President, as we talked about yesterday, will meet with the Dalai Lama here.\xc2\xa0 He will then travel to Denver, Colorado, where he will deliver remarks at an event for Senator Bennet, and then travel to Las Vegas, Nevada.\xc2\xa0 On Friday the President will hold events with Senator Reid in Las Vegas, to include discussion with citizens and business leaders about working together to address the economic challenges facing Nevada and the rest of America.\xc2\xa0 The President will return that afternoon to Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 And I will find out your pool time for Sunday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, are those Reid events fundraisers?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Campaign events?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not believe any of those are fundraisers, but let me double check on that.**</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And no events on Monday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No, he\xe2\x80\x99s got nothing on Monday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Signing the debt limit?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It could be this weekend, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a day yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It will not be today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Ben.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask a little bit about the way things are unfolding on the jobs bill in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Does the President support what\xe2\x80\x99s happened here with Senator Reid trapping this bipartisan bill and offering up a pared-back Democratic one?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s his stance on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s understand, Ben, a couple of different things.\xc2\xa0 One, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there will be only one piece of legislation that will encompass all of the ideas that members in the Senate or even the President have for strengthening our economy and creating a better environment for hiring.\xc2\xa0 I think that will probably take many forms.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve never thought that it was going to go through in one package.</p>\n<p>Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s legislation, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize it as a Democratic-only plan, since the hiring tax credit is, as you know, the Schumer-Hatch -- legislation designed by Senator Schumer and Senator Hatch -- it has small business expensing, a reauthorization of the highway bill, and an extension of Build America bonds.</p>\n<p>Again, I think this is just one of many vehicles that will likely go through the Senate during this process.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a number of ideas that will garner bipartisan support that aren\xe2\x80\x99t in the initial piece of legislation that Senator Reid will move:\xc2\xa0 unemployment insurance extensions, COBRA health care extensions for the unemployed, an extension of the SBA lending program.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a host of things that can and will garner bipartisan support, both in the vehicle that Senator Reid is moving when the Senate gets back and will move throughout this process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House support the vehicle as it stands right now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the jobs tax credit is very akin to what the President had in mind, and I think infrastructure investment is something he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about, the expensing provisions, all of which the President would be eager to sign.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about this, the way this happened yesterday -- there was a statement released by you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s support of a bipartisan Senate bill, and then by day\xe2\x80\x99s end, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bipartisan bill.\xc2\xa0 Were you surprised?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben -- let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, I think that the legislation that Senator Reid will move when the Senate comes back into town will garner bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 I think there are things that Democrats and Republicans alike agree on need to be in the mix, some of which we just went over, that will also garner bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there will just be one vehicle that moves, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there was only one chance at getting bipartisanship.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a series of ideas that all of us agree need to be put forward to stabilize our economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to finish that thought, though, understanding this might garner bipartisan support, the way this happened yesterday, did the White House see it coming?\xc2\xa0 Did you know that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the degree to which Senator Reid, who I see in media reports made his decision before he went to caucus, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the degree to which he talked to us about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of bipartisanship, are you encouraged by what appears to be growing signs of bipartisanship on financial regulation in Congress?\xc2\xa0 Are you encouraged, one, that that might mean a bill could be finished by this summer?\xc2\xa0 And two, do you have any sense -- or is the White House willing to compromise at all on what appears to be the biggest sticking point of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think there are, Jeff, strong signals on a number of fronts that working together has its advantages, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on financial regulatory reform, which obviously the President believes is a big priority this year.</p>\n<p>Look, one of the big points that was discussed in the bipartisan meeting on Tuesday was with Senator McConnell about moving nominees that -- I recounted this story a couple of times yesterday -- with 63 being held for more than a month, 10 times the number that had been held for more than a month at this point in President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s administration.\xc2\xa0 And the Senate passed nearly 30 by unanimous consent last night.</p>\n<p>So I think whether it\xe2\x80\x99s financial regulatory reform, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s provisions to help small businesses, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s moving qualified nominees forward, I think we can see certainly this week the benefits of working together.</p>\n<p>In terms of the consumer office, I think it -- the President still believes it is a great priority to have the independent authority to ensure that consumers in this reform are protected -- protected from the type of loans that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen happen that have led to massive foreclosure; the type of tricks with credit cards that we had seen in the past that legislation that Congress approved and the President signed is intended to deal with.</p>\n<p>So the President continues to be a very strong supporter of that function of the reform bill that we sent to Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does that agency have to be a separate entity?\xc2\xa0 Is that something he would be willing to compromise on to get this through?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the nature of the different proposals are.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is something that would need to have independent authority and I think that is what is important for -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s what consumers want -- important for their protection.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does that indicate, Robert, that maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s some wiggle room as long as independent authority is preserved if it\xe2\x80\x99s not --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, we will -- I think what the President would greatly resist is the notion that somehow this is -- the protection of consumers is unattainable in financial reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the question, though.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I understand, but what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is without knowing what exact vehicle might come in a bipartisan proposal from the Senate, obviously we would look at this assuming that strong consumer protections and authority was in that legislation.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of what that proposal might look like -- what might look like.</p>\n<p>Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last month I asked you if the President had an opinion on some of the discussions in changing the Senate rules so that the Republicans or the minority, whomever in the future, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to demand the cloture be invoked, 60 votes, as often; you said you\xe2\x80\x99d check with Leg Affairs.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s close allies in the Senate, Dick Durbin, is throwing his support behind the bill that Tom Harkin brought up that would introduce a sliding scale so the 60-vote thing wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be required as often.\xc2\xa0 Have you guys discussed it with Senator Durbin?\xc2\xa0 Do you have a position on this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check again on whether Senator Durbin -- whether we\xe2\x80\x99ve had conversation with Senator Durbin.</p>\n<p>Look, I know there\xe2\x80\x99s been great frustration on either side of -- either on this side or on Capitol Hill about the sheer amount of times in which cloture has needed to be invoked.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly discussed the frustrations of -- particularly as it relates to non-controversial legislation or non-controversial nominees.\xc2\xa0 We went through the -- and you heard the President discuss a GSA director that had been stalled for nine months, had to seek cloture, cloture wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a close vote, and then she was approved 96-0.\xc2\xa0 I think at that point you realize that this is the -- this is a rule that is being abused.</p>\n<p>I will check with -- whether any conversations have been had with Senator Durbin about Senator Harkin\xe2\x80\x99s legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then just to follow up on Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question about the bipartisan jobs bill that Schumer, Hatch, Grassley and Baucus have been working on.\xc2\xa0 The reason that was given, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding, by Majority Leader Reid, for scrapping that effort, much to the dismay of the senators who have been working on it, is that there were protests from some of the more liberal or progressive members of the Democratic caucus in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this kind of bipartisan move that those four senators, bipartisan senators, had been working on exactly what the President has been talking about, and isn\xe2\x80\x99t Harry Reid\xe2\x80\x99s move to scrap it, regardless of what comes out of the Senate eventually, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that contrary to what the President has been talking about?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, again, I think what -- again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys put your support behind the bipartisan effort.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And we certainly support working in a bipartisan way to get these things done.\xc2\xa0 Whether the vehicle goes -- Jake, whether the vehicle is the four items that Senator Reid has now, whether that includes unemployment and COBRA extensions now, whether that includes extension for SBA lending, whether it includes tax extenders, whether it includes disaster relief, those are discussions that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have.</p>\n<p>Again, I believe that -- I believe that many of these -- many of these will be implemented and voted on and approved with strong bipartisan majorities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but you guys obviously had lent your support to the bipartisan effort.\xc2\xa0 These four senators have been working hard on this bipartisan effort.\xc2\xa0 And then Senator Reid, because of apparent concerns from liberal Democrats, scrapped it.\xc2\xa0 That had to have been disappointing to the President and antithetical to his calls for bipartisanship.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I do not think that -- I do not think that taking -- first of all, the main part of the piece of legislation that Senator Reid will have the Senate vote on is the Schumer-Hatch jobs tax credit.</p>\n<p>So I think there -- what legislative vehicle many of these bipartisan ideas -- whatever -- it moves on, I think, is in some ways not quite as important as demonstrating that we can work together.\xc2\xa0 Putting as the centerpiece of a bill that\xe2\x80\x99s going to move when the Senate comes back from recess a bipartisan jobs tax credit I think sends the appropriate message to small businesses around the country that Washington can work together to create an environment that incentivizes the additional hiring of workers at small businesses.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has talked about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to paraphrase the President, bipartisanship can\xe2\x80\x99t just be adopting one person\xe2\x80\x99s set of ideas.\xc2\xa0 And I understand Hatch and Schumer were working on the tax credit together, but that was something that was the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal.\xc2\xa0 It was a Democratic idea ultimately.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if the President --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that -- well --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The hiring tax credit.\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the hiring tax credit was -- is a proposal that the President offered -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure you would consider Senator Hatch to be somehow overly sympathetic to the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view on these issues.\xc2\xa0 I think it demonstrates --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s part of a larger package.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my point.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, but a messier -- my messier way of saying I think if you look at both what\xe2\x80\x99s in this legislation and I think if you look at what isn\xe2\x80\x99t in this legislation but will ultimately move, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine a scenario in which extending unemployment benefits for those that have been out of work and having those benefits expire isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to garner bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 Extending health care --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It just looks like a jobs version of -- when the President was asked about, the other day when he was here, and he was asked about Mitch McConnell talking about how they could support -- Republicans could support nuclear energy or clean coal technology, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s response was --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What you assume --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s response was, well, of course, they like -- I\xe2\x80\x99m paraphrasing -- but of course they like that, those were Republican ideas that we\xe2\x80\x99re offering, in the name of bipartisanship.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here is the reverse -- Harry Reid taking out the one Democratic idea.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 Do you think helping small businesses grow by allowing them to write off part of their expenditures is just something that\xe2\x80\x99s a Democratic idea?\xc2\xa0 Do you think extending the highway trust fund extension is somehow a uniquely Democratic idea?\xc2\xa0 I think if you were to break the four components of that bill out individually, each of those would garner strong bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>So I -- look, I think we are in some ways over-reading some of this because, again, I think -- personally believe that the four components of this bill, several components that were in the bipartisan bill but aren\xe2\x80\x99t in the Reid bill, will still be bipartisan.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of the ideas that I\xe2\x80\x99ve listed here today are uniquely Democratic ideas that have dispensed with Republican ideas in their stead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back around.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, could you set us straight on the President\xe2\x80\x99s role in deciding where the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed will be?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously the decision was made appropriately in conjunction with an interagency process by the Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 But obviously there are efforts on Capitol Hill through legislation to restrict either the type of or the venue of a trial for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his co-conspirators.\xc2\xa0 That, by definition, involves the White House and ultimately the President.</p>\n<p>So since this effort has moved from strictly a Justice Department decision to something that\xe2\x80\x99s in the legislative arena, the White House and by definition the President are involved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s being depicted as if he is actually the person who is saying this is where it will be.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not in the Map Room with a big map picking a location.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President and members of -- White House staff have an equity in this, given what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, on Capitol Hill legislatively.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that, though -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you read your note first if you would like.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day note?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Does it have Snoopy on it?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- passing notes --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will -- I was wrong earlier.\xc2\xa0 If you want to let folks know, just got word that the debt limit PAYGO will be signed later today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Behind closed doors?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Coverage?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not on my note.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on the Khalid Sheikh Mohammed question, on Sunday, when Katie Couric asked the President, have you ruled out trying Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York City, he said, "I have not ruled it out."\xc2\xa0 Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he saying there that, by saying "I have not ruled it out," that he is essentially the decision-maker on this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s part of -- I mean, obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he said that he had not ruled it out; that we would take into account the security and logistical concerns that had been brought forth by New York City.\xc2\xa0 And those will be, as he said, taken into account before a final decision is made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the final decision, as he strongly implied here, will be by him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think -- I think he will have strong equities in this decision and will hear from a lot of different people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When do you think the decision will come down?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- I know there were -- it was brought up in a meeting that I was in earlier today, but it was not a decision-making meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then you said he\xe2\x80\x99ll be hearing from a lot of people, then the input is coming to him for him to make a decision?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I think -- I think he will hear from a lot of people; he will be involved in a larger process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s much more deeply involved personally now that he was in the original decision?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again -- again, because of -- because Congress has become involved in this, because legislation could restrict the venue and the type of trial, the White House is more involved, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that there was kind of a political tin ear here to make the decision to try him in New York in the first place, since it looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s heading in a different direction now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, Chip, I\xe2\x80\x99ll remind you that some of the people that -- some of the people that you hear now that are opposed to the trial in New York were in November supportive of the trial.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take into account security and logistical concerns that those -- that those individuals now have.\xc2\xa0 The cost of the trial obviously is one thing, and all of that will be taken into account.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just follow up on Ben and Jake\xe2\x80\x99s line of questioning here.\xc2\xa0 I think your answer is basically that, in the end, most of the stuff will be taken up and hopefully on a bipartisan basis.\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t bipartisanship also about tone?\xc2\xa0 And by doing what Harry Reid did yesterday -- here you had four members working together -- I mean, people were looking around going, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong here?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got four people working together on a bipartisan basis -- and then we realized what was wrong here -- Harry Reid was about to slap them in the face, or as Chuck Grassley said, pull the rug out from under this effort again.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s tone --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I just --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- he destroyed the tone of bipartisanship.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s over -- an over-reading of the situation.\xc2\xa0 Again, the centerpiece of -- the centerpiece for job creation in the bipartisan legislation was the Schumer-Hatch small business hiring tax cut.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And now Hatch is furious, and so is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- that\xe2\x80\x99s now the hallmark of legislation that will move in the Senate.</p>\n<p>Look, here\xe2\x80\x99s what I think is most important, is, are we going to -- are we going to get these individual items and items that aren\xe2\x80\x99t in this legislation passed to benefit the American people, and are we going to get them passed in a bipartisan way?\xc2\xa0 I think the answer to both of those questions is yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So all that matters in the end is whether they pass with bipartisan votes, not whether people are actually working together in a concerted effort.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, because I think -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have bipartisan votes because they\xe2\x80\x99re working together on ideas that appeal to both Democrats and Republicans.</p>\n<p>The President\xe2\x80\x99s example -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s example that he used that Jake brought up the other day was when you just have idea that appeals to one party on this side or just an idea that appeals to the party on the other side.\xc2\xa0 Tax cuts to encourage equipment investment is not a partisan idea.\xc2\xa0 Reauthorizing and extending the highway bill for a year always gets strong bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 Build America bonds will have bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 The hiring tax credit, written by a Democratic senator and a Republican senator by definition will have bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s not in that bill, extending tax cuts, will likely have bipartisan support, including something like the research and development tax credit, which is extended year after year.</p>\n<p>Extending unemployment compensation and health care for the unemployed will garner bipartisan support because it\xe2\x80\x99s not a partisan idea.\xc2\xa0 Extending a lending program --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House support the hardball partisan tactic of --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99re greatly over-reading and greatly over-simplifying what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t -- they think it was a hardball political tactic.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t see it.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Attorney General Holder\xe2\x80\x99s comments to The Washington Post -- "At the end of the day, wherever this case is tried, in whatever forum, what we have to ensure is that it\xe2\x80\x99s done as transparently as possible and in adherence to the rules" -- is that a softening of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position about holding the KSM trial in Article III courts?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, because the question that was posed to him asks if fair trials can be held in military commissions.\xc2\xa0 And I can get you a transcript of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We should not read it as a new openness to military commissions for KSM?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, understanding this, that military commissions had traditionally been something that had faced, through the Supreme Court, constitutional problems until this administration, working on a bipartisan basis with Capitol Hill, reformed that process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like, or does the administration feel, that military commissions are inferior to Article III courts?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think, again, I think the way that things have -- I think the reform efforts that had been brought about ensure the type of protections that would withstand constitutional and Supreme Court scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration considering a military commission for KSM?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would just go back to what I said earlier in the sense that there are a series of things that are being looked at, most appropriately the security and logistical concerns of those in New York, as a decision is being made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And very quickly, would the President be involved, as he is with the location of any civilian court trial, be involved in the consideration of whether it should be moved to a military commission or would that interfere with the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s independence?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed why the President is involved and how he\xe2\x80\x99ll take part in that.</p>\n<p>Laura.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just following right up on that, you said -- she asked if there were -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been asked if there would be -- if military commissions were something you were considering and your response was, there are a series of things being looked at.\xc2\xa0 So I would read that to mean that, yes, that is one of the things; is that correct?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would just say this.\xc2\xa0 Without illuminating all of the factors that are involved, first and foremost there are, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, security concerns, logistical concerns, about where you would hold the trial in New York, what that would mean for the downtown area, that have to be taken into account.\xc2\xa0 But as you heard the President say last week, he\xe2\x80\x99s not ruled out the fact that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed would still be tried in a federal court in New York.</p>\n<p>So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- first and foremost, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t ruled out the other option though?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Focused on the decision at hand.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of recess appointments, when you talk about this issue you talk about people who haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to even come up for a vote because they\xe2\x80\x99re being held by one senator over this, that, or the other.\xc2\xa0 Does the President view it as an option to use recess appointments for somebody like Craig Becker, who did in fact have a majority but not the supermajority needed?\xc2\xa0 And did -- obviously his nomination did come up a vote.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think there are -- the President has nominated qualified, very qualified individuals for the positions that he\xe2\x80\x99s nominated them for.\xc2\xa0 We hope and believe that after the discussion that the President had with Senator McConnell on Tuesday, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the Senate heard that conversation and acted.</p>\n<p>But you heard -- you saw the President in a statement last night -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to foreclose that if what continues to stall -- if the stalling tactics continue, he\xe2\x80\x99s not ruling out using recess appointments for anybody that he\xe2\x80\x99s nominated.</p>\n<p>The best way to avoid that?\xc2\xa0 The best way to avoid that is for the Senate to work through this process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in the case of Becker, would you view that as a stalling technique to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it is a possibility that you would -- he might be --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Anybody that the President has nominated that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been approved is somebody that the President would consider --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What if he only got 49 votes?\xc2\xa0 Would he consider it in that case?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go through a whole host of different scenarios.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that\xe2\x80\x99s what the founders had in mind with the recess appointment provision -- to give him the authority to circumvent a Senate action or inaction on nominees, when the Senate --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not spoken constitutionally with the President about his theory on it.\xc2\xa0 I think the practical measure is -- again, understand that while the -- what the Senate did last night, in moving a series of nominees that the President thought were qualitatively and quantitatively different than what had been held at that point in the Bush administration, is still that way, right?\xc2\xa0 There are 63 that had been pending for a month.\xc2\xa0 They dealt with about half of them, right?\xc2\xa0 So instead of a 10-1 ratio with the Bush administration, we have a 5-1 ratio.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President believes that\xe2\x80\x99s an acceptable number either.</p>\n<p>The best way to deal with this, though, is by having the Senate work through the process of voting up or down on these nominees.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you remember whether then-Senator Obama objected when Senator Reid kept the chamber in session during the last two years of the Bush administration so that he could not make any recess appointment?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If you may have that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was asking if you recall.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 One other question.\xc2\xa0 I wondered what you thought of a CBS News/New York Times poll finding last night --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 CBS News.\xc2\xa0 Never really heard of it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that showed that only 12 percent of those surveyed believed they got a tax cut over the last year.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say they called the wrong people.\xc2\xa0 No, I -- (laughter) -- yes, I know -- (laughter) -- no, look, I think what -- look, I think what happened, and one of the things that I think will go through this bipartisan jobs process is state and local aid, right?\xc2\xa0 Understand, if you look at last month\xe2\x80\x99s jobs report, the number of state and local government jobs lost was 41,000 out of that monthly jobs report, because I think in many cases -- and you see now, too, the importance of something like state and local aid, because as bad as state budgets were last year, they\xe2\x80\x99re actually worse this year.</p>\n<p>So I think even as -- even as people may or may not have felt what they got from the federal government, they may have gotten something different from their state and local government in order to make up for a collective budget shortfall among the 50 states in something that exceeded $125 billion.</p>\n<p>So, look, I think that -- look, is it part of the frustration?\xc2\xa0 Of course.\xc2\xa0 Ninety-five percent of working people in this country saw their taxes cut last year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What percent?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ninety-five.\xc2\xa0 But only, apparently, 12 percent felt it.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back to the terror suspects.\xc2\xa0 I want to make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m clear here.\xc2\xa0 What exactly needs to happen before we get a decision?\xc2\xa0 Is the President, for example, is he awaiting some specific recommendations from Holder, given all the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, they\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of going -- they\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of working through the many issues, some of which had been brought up by those in New York about the concerns of a trial there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there -- you also have to wait for Congress to act on whether to restrict the funding also, too.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision is -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the timeline for a presidential decision is held up by the timing of whether the Senate or the House act on -- individually on legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he awaiting any particular recommendations from Mr. Holder?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the process of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, just to say that that process is ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he favor a military commission trial short of being ordered to do so by Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think Savannah largely asked that, and, again, this is a process that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just follow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what kind of message are we sending to the countries like India who are dealing in a tougher way with the terrorists, and also helping the United States on a global war against terrorism, as far as this trial and being soft on the terrorists and here, what they feel back home?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the last part of that, Goyal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many countries feel that U.S. should be tougher than those countries that -- who are with the United States as far as dealing with the terrorists.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- I forget the exact date that he was brought into custody, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time.\xc2\xa0 One way or the other, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed will be brought to justice by these decisions.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can be any tougher than that.\xc2\xa0 This President has, without going into great detail, taken the fight internationally to terror suspects.\xc2\xa0 We will -- we are going to seek -- we will seek justice -- justice delayed, by the way -- on behalf of thousands that were killed on September 11th because of the hateful acts of somebody like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one on the economy, please?\xc2\xa0 Follow on the economy?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me go back to Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Senate jobs bill, setting aside the political question for a second, does the White House believe it\xe2\x80\x99s large enough to have a legitimate economic effect to create jobs?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Major, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think what has the umbrella of a jobs bill is going to be the only components that the House and the Senate deal with in creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 I think extending unemployment benefits is something that is important for those that don\xe2\x80\x99t have work in sustaining their effort to help find work.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not in what the Senate will deal with at the end of this recess, but is a component of a series of measures that the President outlined either at the Brookings speech that he gave, at the State of the Union, or that\xe2\x80\x99s in his budget.</p>\n<p>So again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t look at what --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not in there, either.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t look at what -- and the administration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look at what is going to happen at the end of February when the Senate considers these four provisions to be the end of that consideration of measures dealing with economic stability.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the administration therefore continue to prioritize whatever other follow-on legislation comes from the Senate and the House on jobs over any other issues, specifically health care?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President has --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By definition is to elongate the process of dealing with jobs legislation -- having it in smaller bills.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look -- well, look, the legislative process will work through itself.\xc2\xa0 But, look, obviously some things you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have on because for unemployment benefits or for COBRA you meet deadlines for expiring benefits that these individuals that are unemployed need.</p>\n<p>I think we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased with the pacing of this.\xc2\xa0 This was something that, if you go from the State of the Union to what the Senate will consider, understanding that the House has already passed a fairly --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Much larger.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- big package, so you\xe2\x80\x99ve got half that process done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to give you a chance to address something that was in the Washington Post editorial -- or op-ed section today by former Attorney General Mukasey.\xc2\xa0 Let me just read it to you and get your chance for response:\xc2\xa0 "Contrary to what the White House homeland security advisor and the attorney general had suggested, if not said outright, not only was there no authority or policy in place under the Bush administration requiring that all those detained in the United States be treated as criminal defendants, but relevant authority was and is the opposite."</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Read the last part again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Picking up where?\xc2\xa0 "But relevant" -- "There is no authority or policy in place under the Bush administration requiring that all those detained in the United States be treated as criminal defendants," which Mukasey suggests your administration has said was the Bush administration policy.\xc2\xa0 He goes on to write, "But relevant authority was and is the opposite."</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you disagree with his --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that either Judge Mukasey or Attorney General Mukasey would argue that in the process of somebody being an enemy combatant that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, in fighting their detention, have access, based on his ruling, to counsel.\xc2\xa0 Right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Access to habeas petition.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not all other rights.\xc2\xa0 As he goes on to write -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go through the whole thing -- but he says, in the Hamdi case, and in relevant Padillas dealings, habeas petitions were created as a legal venue but not all the other rights --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, but let\xe2\x80\x99s also --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that he says you guys are accusing the Bush administration of granting in a blanket way.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s also deal with what Attorney General Mukasey and others in the Bush administration, they\xe2\x80\x99ve suggested that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- because military commissions weren\xe2\x80\x99t set up, that somebody like a Richard Reid, Mirandized five minutes after he was taken off of an American Airlines flight, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been held because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have military commissions.</p>\n<p>Military commissions aren\xe2\x80\x99t a venue for interrogation.\xc2\xa0 Military commissions are a venue for adjudicating justice.\xc2\xa0 Is Attorney General Mukasey saying in his op-ed that the United States of America, the minute that they walked a Mirandized Richard Reid off of an American flight in Boston, didn\xe2\x80\x99t have law of war detention?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a principle that has -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a principle that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had for as long as this country has existed.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he presumed that law of war detention didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist on that day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the KSM trial location, how concerned is the President or the White House legislative team about what appears to be a growing number of Senate Democrats signing on to legislation to block all funding entirely?\xc2\xa0 And to what degree is the President telephoning members to try to persuade them to either hold off or change their mind?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I do not know of calls that the President has made.\xc2\xa0 There may have been calls from the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office or from Legislative Affairs to discuss people\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on legislation or on potential upcoming votes.\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99d just leave it --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This would assume a very important consideration of Congress in this entire debate, would it not?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question about it.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is an important aspect of this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important aspect of our broader efforts in dealing with terrorism, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the administration is working through actively.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President would not be personally involved why, if it\xe2\x80\x99s so important?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I just -- I do not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying I do not believe he has made phone calls -- you asked me specifically about phone calls to Democrats about the legislation.\xc2\xa0 I will go back and look at the phone logs that are sent around, but I do not -- nothing pops into my head, but let me double check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I want to try the jobs bill thing again.\xc2\xa0 On Chip\xe2\x80\x99s point of tone, Senator Reid changed course, and then effectively challenged Republicans to oppose the bill.\xc2\xa0 That was a fairly significant change in tone, and Republicans feel that they are being set up politically here, to some degree.\xc2\xa0 Can they trust the President and Democratic leadership in Congress when they talk about bipartisanship if this is the first kind of experience they\xe2\x80\x99re having since the State of the Union and a lot of this bipartisan talk?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Of course Republicans can trust the President.\xc2\xa0 They were in a room not far from where we\xe2\x80\x99re sitting discussing many of the elements that will be voted on at the end of February on a jobs bill.</p>\n<p>Again, I think that -- again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a strong bipartisan vote.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see -- and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a strong bipartisan vote on aspects that aren\xe2\x80\x99t in this legislation but are part of what Democrats and Republicans alike believe is important for stabilizing our economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House understand Republican frustration over this, though?\xc2\xa0 It sounds to me like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, what\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re asking if we\xe2\x80\x99re -- have we been frustrated about bipartisanship for the better part of the past more than a year?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ve --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically on this point, on this -- that the White House came out yesterday, endorsed the process that was taking place; that changes; Republicans are angry and confused.\xc2\xa0 Do you understand that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I -- the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about bipartisanship on accident.\xc2\xa0 The President has throughout his tenure as President been frustrated that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t worked together more -- not just about what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing economically now, but what we had to do economically a little more than a year ago when the times were even more dire; when we were facing job loss in the, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed in here, the 700,000 range each month; when we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if we\xe2\x80\x99d wake up and the financial system that day would have collapsed.</p>\n<p>Look, I can understand the frustration of Democrats and Republicans alike that regrettably the process of Washington has overwhelmed a series of ideas that the American people want to see work for them on behalf of the cares and concerns that they have -- absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just two questions?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe come back at the end.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Like a cherry on top of the sundae.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to Mark\xe2\x80\x99s question on the public perception of the tax cuts, does that reflect a marketing problem?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I think it -- look, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to demonstrate to people that did get a tax cut at a federal level if they saw based on a budget shortfall in a state that may had to have raised taxes and fees.</p>\n<p>Look, that\xe2\x80\x99s why -- you know, look, I think that -- I think that the American people look at a number of different factors that go into understanding and speaking to the frustration that they have about this economy.\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 These things -- they don\xe2\x80\x99t happen in silos.\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 What happens at a federal level and what happens at a state level are felt by both -- both of those are felt by individuals on the ground.</p>\n<p>I think what it demonstrates is that whether there\xe2\x80\x99s four aspects of a package that\xe2\x80\x99s moving through the Senate, that there are going to have to be a series of things that happen in coordination with all levels of government in order to get this economy moving again.\xc2\xa0 If the federal government adds money through recovery to stimulate demand while states are having to pull back greatly, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to create a situation where that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to ultimately be felt.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why one of the big aspects of the recovery plan that was originally passed by Congress was state and local fiscal relief through FMAP funding, which cushioned that blow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You also structured the tax cut in a way that was supposed to maximize its economic impact by adding it in these little --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did that sort of minimize the political impact?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, you know, would I have liked to hire somebody to knock on everyone\xe2\x80\x99s door, you know, like the Publishers Clearing House guys and the big check in the balloons and the TV cameras?\xc2\xa0 Sure, maybe that would have had a -- maybe it would have had a greater effect.\xc2\xa0 I think what the economic team found in the structuring of that tax cut was that if I hand you $350, and you know you\xe2\x80\x99re not likely to get handed $350 every week, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to pocket and save that money, because you\xe2\x80\x99re struggling economically.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99re much more likely to put that into the economy in increased consumer spending and demand if you understand that it is going to be something that you feel maybe not all at once but a little bit over a series of time, in that you can increase your demand by that much.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the way the tax cut was structured.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the marketers got kicked out of that meeting.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you guys have been very critical of Republicans on filibusters.\xc2\xa0 So what message does the White House think it sends when on the jobs bill Senator Reid is practically forcing a filibuster by filing for cloture before there\xe2\x80\x99s been even a minute of floor debate and precluding the chance for any amendments?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is not going to be the last bite of the apple that the Senate has.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- these are four very bipartisan ideas.\xc2\xa0 One of them is named by -- the name involves a Democrat senator and a Republican senator, by definition a bipartisan idea.\xc2\xa0 Four elements that individually will garner bipartisan support and as a whole will garner bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is not the last time that the Senate is going to take up measures that involve economic stability.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t bothered by the way he\xe2\x80\x99s not allowing for any amendments or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of time to go back and do -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to extend unemployment benefits.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to extend small business lending.\xc2\xa0 All of that will be part of this.</p>\n<p>Christy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, there are reports that China has asked the White House to cancel its meeting with the Dalai Lama.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if that\xe2\x80\x99s true?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know that obviously we discussed the fact that this meeting would happen on our trip to Beijing.\xc2\xa0 Before I announced it we talked to them and said we\xe2\x80\x99re going to announce this meeting.\xc2\xa0 I do not know -- I do not know if their specific reaction was to cancel it.\xc2\xa0 If that was their specific reaction, the meeting will take place as planned next Thursday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President discuss the shift to Tibetan independence with the Dalai Lama?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, instead of -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a readout of what they do talk about as a result of that meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the official U.S. position on Tibetan independence?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will get that information to you after that meeting.\xc2\xa0 Nice try, though.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I have a question for you on "don\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell."\xc2\xa0 Yesterday there was a report in Politico saying the White House hasn\xe2\x80\x99t provided Congress with a clear path forward on this issue following the President\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union announcement.\xc2\xa0 What kind of guidance is the President giving lawmakers as the Pentagon undertakes its review?\xc2\xa0 And is the President expecting repeal legislation on his desk this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The last part again?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President expecting repeal legislation on his desk this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President outlined in the State of the Union, and you heard Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen discuss a process that will take place, if that process results in legislation by year\xe2\x80\x99s end, the President would certainly sign it.</p>\n<p>I think most importantly, the President, the military, and others feel like we have the best process structure moving forward to end "don\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell."</p>\n<p>Christy, on your thing, obviously the President will discuss with the Dalai Lama there his belief that he and the Chinese continue to discuss the issues that they have relating to Tibet, and I assume we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a readout after that.</p>\n<p>David, do you have anything?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a follow-up, actually.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President support a legislative moratorium on discharges under "don\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell" at this time until the Pentagon completes its review?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to what the -- the testimony from Gates and Mullen in what that process will\xc2\xa0 -- the process that will take place over the course of the next year.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday at the news conference when the President talked about the jobs bill, back then he mentioned doing this incrementally.\xc2\xa0 He used that word, "incrementally" --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the news conference on Tuesday when the President talked about the jobs bill he mentioned doing it incrementally.\xc2\xa0 So even back then, was he talking about either splitting it or doing it --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, they\xe2\x80\x99re ideas that were outlined -- they\xe2\x80\x99re ideas that the President outlined, again, in his speech in December and in the State of the Union that -- ideas that the House didn\xe2\x80\x99t pass, partly because their jobs package happened before his speech in December.\xc2\xa0 There were different ideas that the Senate was considering, not all of which included the President\xe2\x80\x99s ideas.\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t think then and we don\xe2\x80\x99t think now that this is a one-shot deal.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s most important to keep in mind.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given what you call the frustration with the sheer amount of cloture votes, has the President, the administration and through Senator Reid, ever talked about calling the Republicans bluff, making them go to an actual filibuster, especially over one of these non-controversial nominees --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a process that takes an inordinate amount of time on something that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be controversial.</p>\n<p>I think instead of -- I think the best way to move forward is to go through each of the very qualified nominees that are held for no reason other than, in some cases last week, because somebody didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a couple of earmarks, and instead do this in a way that takes qualified individuals that have been nominated and allows them to serve in government.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the most important way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just two questions.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chicago Tribune reports that five days after Scott Lee Cohen won the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor of Illinois in the primary, Cohen withdrew after reports of beating his wife, using a knife to threaten a girlfriend prostitute, tax evasion, and use of anabolic steroids.\xc2\xa0 And my question:\xc2\xa0 Did the President ever have any concern about former lieutenant governor nominee Cohen being supported by Mayor Daley?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who made what endorsements during the primary.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President, and many staffers here, were concerned about exactly what you read and think the right decision was made to leave the ticket.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the honorary President of the Boy Scouts of America, what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the New York Post report that because the Scouts have a policy similar to our armed forces, "New York institutions are barring scouts from meeting or recruiting in all public schools"?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the New York Post report and can have somebody --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, does he think that it\xe2\x80\x99s fair for them to cut the Scouts out of this?\xc2\xa0 How does he support -- does he disagree with the Scouts or what?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Where are you on this, Lester?\xc2\xa0 Are you -- is this --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nowhere.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I do know where.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I support the Scouts.\xc2\xa0 Do you support the Scouts?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My son is -- we\xe2\x80\x99re constructing the pinewood derby car as we speak.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a Scout, your son is a Scout?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be disappointed if his car doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do well, but his father tends to be constructionally challenged.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n1:52 P.M.
