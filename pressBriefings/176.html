EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to Newark, New Jersey, where the President will visit with leaders in this community who are working to rehabilitate and reintegrate formerly incarcerated individuals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe potential benefits of their work is important. \xc2\xa0First, it gives those who have paid their debt to society the kind of second chance that they deserve. \xc2\xa0Second, it\'s good for the local economy. \xc2\xa0We\'re talking about more workers with better skills who could be more effective in providing for their families and being more productive members of society. \xc2\xa0Third, this is critical to lowering recidivism rates and crime rates over all. \xc2\xa0Someone with a fair shot and decent prospects is much better positioned to succeed than someone who is simply being turned out onto the street.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Newark community is a leader in these efforts. \xc2\xa0Mayor Baraka and Senator Booker deserve a lot of credit for that. \xc2\xa0And the experience of the community in Newark should inform our efforts in Washington as we seek to reform our criminal justice system to make our system more fair and our communities safe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that will be the topic of the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities there today. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s going to visit a couple of different sites where he\'ll be seeing firsthand these efforts at work.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that, we\'ll go to your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s governor has spent the morning on television railing against the President for taking credit for things he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do and repeating his claim that the President is insufficiently supportive of law enforcement. \xc2\xa0Do you have any reactions to his comments?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Josh, I\'ve noted before that Governor Christie\xe2\x80\x99s comments in this regard have been particularly irresponsible, but not surprising for somebody whose poll numbers are closer to an asterisk than they are double digits. \xc2\xa0So clearly this is part of the strategy for turning that around. \xc2\xa0We\'ll see if it works.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I feel like just a few years ago, the President came up with Governor Christie to sort of join forces after Hurricane Sandy. \xc2\xa0It seemed like you guys were on the same page. \xc2\xa0You seemed to have a sharp tone, too. \xc2\xa0Was that just responding to him, or do you think his leadership has declined in the last few years?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think this is a response to his comments of late, which I\'m not sure are aimed at actually solving the problem other than the problem that exists with his poll numbers. But -- go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You were mentioning before that Senator Booker and Mayor Baraka deserve some credit for some of what\xe2\x80\x99s gone successfully in Newark. \xc2\xa0Does Governor Christie deserve any credit for his policies on law enforcement and criminal justice reform?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'ll be honest, I\'m not aware of the details of his record in terms of whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s taken steps to support the kinds of programs that we\'re going to visit today. But if he were interested in talking about that record and investments that he had made in these kinds of community projects that are clearly making a difference in communities like Newark then he can certainly make that case for himself. \xc2\xa0That\'s not what he\xe2\x80\x99s chosen to focus his attention on, which leads me to believe that his record in this regard may not be sterling. \xc2\xa0But again, you guys can go check that out and he can go make the case for himself.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have any comments on the Turkish election and particularly what that may mean for the relationship between the Turks and the Kurds going forward?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0John, I do have a statement on this: \xc2\xa0The United States congratulates the people of Turkey on their participation in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s elections. \xc2\xa0We look forward to working with the newly elected parliament and with the future government. \xc2\xa0As a friend and NATO ally, the United States is committed to continuing our close coordination with Turkey to advance our shared political, security and prosperity agendas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe are, however, deeply concerned that media outlets and individual journalists critical of the government were subject to pressure and intimidation during the campaign, seemingly in a manner calculated to weaken political opposition. \xc2\xa0We note that the OSCE released a statement today highlighting that parliamentary elections in Turkey offered voters a variety of choices but that the campaign was affected by violence and restrictions on media freedom. \xc2\xa0We have both publicly and privately raised our concerns about freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly in Turkey, and we continue to urge Turkish authorities to uphold the universal democratic values that are enshrined in Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s constitution.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What about in terms of what this may mean for relations between the Kurds and the Turks going forward?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point, the Turkish government is in the process of forming, and the impact of this election is one that is still being assessed -- obviously it\'s only been a day. \xc2\xa0But moving forward, we will be able to assess the government\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the kind of democratic principles that are enshrined in Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s constitution.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is that something the President is likely to raise on his upcoming trip to Turkey?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President is going to Turkey for the G20. \xc2\xa0Obviously the Turkish government, President Erdogan, will be hosting leaders around the world who will be in attendance. \xc2\xa0I would anticipate that the President will see President Erdogan at that meeting, but the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule there is still being put together. \xc2\xa0So we\'ll have more details on the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip soon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, on another international incident, has the White House been watching this plane crash over Egypt and do you have any intelligence or comment on the cause of it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jeff, let me start by offering our condolences to the Russian people, particularly those who lost loved ones in the crash of the airliner over the weekend. \xc2\xa0This was obviously a tragic incident and the lives of hundreds of people were lost.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRussian and Egyptian authorities are investigating the crash to try to determine the cause, and at this point, I don\'t want to get ahead of an ongoing investigation. \xc2\xa0Just anticipating your next question, we are also aware of claims of responsibility by extremists in the Sinai Peninsula. \xc2\xa0But rather than speculating on what may have led to this terribly tragic incident, we\'re going to allow the investigation to move forward to try to get to the bottom of what happened.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the U.S. offering support for those investigations? And has that been requested by either the Russians or the Egyptians?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The United States has offered support for the investigation. \xc2\xa0But at this point, I\'m not aware of any resources that have been dedicated thus far. \xc2\xa0But that obviously is an open offer. \xc2\xa0And while not aware of any American lives that were lost, we obviously have an interest in helping Egyptian and Russian authorities get to the bottom of what exactly occurred there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On that topic, number of European airlines have put a moratorium on flying in that airspace over the Sinai until this gets figured out. \xc2\xa0Does the U.S. have any plans to make recommendations that American pilots not traverse that airspace?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This is a decision that\'s made by the FAA, based on their own analysis of the situation. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any announcements that the FAA has made in this regard today, but you can follow up with them and see if they have anything planned.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I think Wednesday will mark the one month since the TPP partnership was announced with the 12 countries. \xc2\xa0The text has not been released yet. \xc2\xa0Do you anticipate USTR and this administration releasing that text publicly this week or next week before the President goes to Asia?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0David, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten a timing update on when they expect to complete the finalized text. \xc2\xa0I know that in the 29 days or so that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on it that a lot of sweat equity has gone into correctly translating the document and making sure that all those I\xe2\x80\x99s are dotted and T\xe2\x80\x99s were crossed. This is a rather extensive document and so --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any particular holdup, or do you -- and are you concerned about the timetable slipping?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve not been briefed about any concerns about finalizing the document. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just been an arduous task. So they\'re still working on it. \xc2\xa0We\'re hoping to be able to release it as soon as possible. \xc2\xa0And we\'re going to stick to the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment that he made to giving the American people and the Congress appropriate time -- I believe it\'s 60 days -- to review that document before the President himself will even sign it. \xc2\xa0And that will initiate an even longer process for public review of the agreement prior to Congress taking action.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there will be ample time for the public to consider this document before individual political leaders have to weigh in on it. \xc2\xa0But all the more important reason that we should make sure that we get the text accurately translated and all the I\xe2\x80\x99s dotted and T\xe2\x80\x99s crossed before it\xe2\x80\x99s released.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaker Ryan said over the weekend he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to take up immigration reform because the President has proved that he can\'t be trusted on the issue. \xc2\xa0Given that you have this new chance now with this new Speaker coming in, does the President plan to do anything to try and restore trust with Speaker Ryan?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I noted the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s comments over the weekend with a healthy sense of irony that apparently is not shared on the other side of the aisle. \xc2\xa0Then-Congressman Ryan was instrumental in working in a bipartisan fashion on Capitol Hill to produce bipartisan legislation. \xc2\xa0That bipartisan legislation passed the United States Senate with bipartisan support, and bipartisan legislation would have passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support if Republican leaders in Congress, including Congressman Ryan, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t blocked it coming to the floor.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s particularly ironic for Speaker Ryan to make that claim when Speaker Ryan himself was instrumental in putting together the agreement and blocked its consideration even though he knew it would pass. \xc2\xa0So that\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s particularly ironic to suggest that somehow he now doesn\'t trust the President on this issue. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s preposterous.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- executive action that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken the Republicans feel like exceeded the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s welcome to disagree with that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard for him to say that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a little hard for him to make the claim that somehow the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t acted in good faith on immigration when Speaker Ryan actively thwarted a compromise that he himself helped to broker. \xc2\xa0And then for him to come back and claim that it\xe2\x80\x99s somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s fault -- it\'s preposterous.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I understand that he\xe2\x80\x99s got some complicated politics to take care of in the House when it comes to the significant fractures inside of his own conference, and he knows best how to handle that, as is evidenced by the strong support that he got from his conference in the Speaker election. \xc2\xa0But pandering to the extreme right wing of the Republican conference, including comments -- preposterous comments like that has not served the party or the country very well and it certainly is not indicative of the new era of Republican leadership that Speaker Ryan has promised.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you see anything at all that you guys can do with Congress between now and the end of the President\xe2\x80\x99s term? \xc2\xa0Or are we at a point now where that\'s pretty much done?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think there are some things. \xc2\xa0And the disappointing comments from Speaker Ryan notwithstanding when it comes to immigration, there are some areas where we may be able to work together. \xc2\xa0And the first one is this criminal justice reform issue that the President is going to be talking about today. \xc2\xa0There has been interest from Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill who recognize the opportunity that exists both to make our criminal justice system more fair and our communities more safe by reforming our criminal justice system. \xc2\xa0That would be a good thing and I am optimistic that we may be able to work together in bipartisan fashion to get that done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTo his credit, Congressman Ryan -- and now Speaker Ryan -- was instrumental in building a bipartisan majority for trade promotion authority legislation, and we\'re hopeful that he can play a similar role when it comes to the consideration of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. \xc2\xa0So those are certainly two things off the top of my head where Democrats and Republicans can work together.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI know that Speaker Ryan is interested in tax reform. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward our own proposal for how we could do tax reform in a way that would lower rates, close loopholes, yield some money for important infrastructure investments, while not adding to the deficit. \xc2\xa0I think that\'s what many people describe as a common-sense proposal. \xc2\xa0So if Speaker Ryan is interested in putting forward his own common-sense proposal to try to find some common ground there, that could be another area where we could work together. \xc2\xa0But that remains to be seen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0About a third of the people being released today are undocumented immigrants. \xc2\xa0Will the administration be helping to provide legal counsel to them for their ability to stay in the U.S., or as some people have called for, will you be watching that they get deported swiftly?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jeff, for the process of handling those formerly incarcerated individuals who are not citizens of the United States, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to ICE. \xc2\xa0I think the way that this typically works is that these individuals are remanded to the custody of ICE who has a formal process for handling these individuals. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the ins and outs of the process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been about two weeks since the Canadian elections, and both advocates and opponents of the Keystone pipeline are expecting some type of decision at some point, maybe soon. \xc2\xa0Is it feasible that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be a decision during this administration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Our expectation at this point, Brian, is that the President will make a decision before the end of his administration on the Keystone pipeline, but when exactly that will be I don\'t know at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think it might happen this year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s possible. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also possible it could happen next year. \xc2\xa0The State Department may be able to give you some more details about the possible timing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnybody else? \xc2\xa0Okay, thanks, guys.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:06 P.M.
