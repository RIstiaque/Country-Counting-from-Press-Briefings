PST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just want to say that for the first time in my year as Press Secretary I remembered that it\'s Friday and I\'m supposed to provide a week ahead.\xc2\xa0 But rather than torture you by reading it in its entirety, we\'re just going to hand it out, if that\'s okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way from the glorious Bay area of Northern California to Seattle, Washington, where the President looks forward to holding an event today highlighting his commitment to expanding manufacturing in the United States and to expanding our exports abroad with the goal of doubling our exports by 2015.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you have any response to Mitt Romney in a Wall Street Journal op/ed promising to designate China as a currency manipulator?\xc2\xa0 He\'s accusing the administration of rewarding China and penalizing American workers because they haven\'t designated China as a currency manipulator.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kate, as you know, this administration has worked very constructively with both China and others around the globe on issues that are of a concern to us, including the valuation of the Chinese currency.\xc2\xa0 We always raise this issue in our conversations with the Chinese leadership.\xc2\xa0 We continue to press Beijing on the need to appreciate the currency as part of an overall emphasis that we have on ensuring that there\'s a level playing field in trade.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know from the recent visit by Vice President Xi to the United States -- I guess the visit is continuing today -- we were very candid in our discussions with the Chinese about areas not only where we seek to cooperate in regional and global affairs, but also where we have disagreements and concerns, and this is one of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not designate them, though, as a currency manipulator?\xc2\xa0 Because Romney says it\'s one of the first things he\'s going to do when he -- if he\'s elected.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know you know this issue pretty well, Kate, and you know that this administration has been very focused on pressing the Chinese to take the necessary steps to appreciate its currency.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on payroll tax, the House just voted in support of it.\xc2\xa0 Are you guys concerned at all about the likely passage in the Senate today?\xc2\xa0 And has the President been reaching out to any wary Senate Democrats to try to get their support?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We look forward to passage of the bill -- the payroll tax cut extension, unemployment insurance extension, doc fix extension -- through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 There was a good vote in the House, as you noted, earlier today.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to signing the bill right away.\xc2\xa0 He has made no calls -- he made no calls yesterday or this morning on the bill that I\'m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you confident, then, of its passage in the Senate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, nothing is done until it\'s done.\xc2\xa0 But we feel cautiously optimistic.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President\'s visit to the Chinese restaurant yesterday that apparently still serves shark fin soup has caused something of a ruckus in San Francisco.\xc2\xa0 Was he aware of -- that it was still on the menu when he went there?\xc2\xa0 And is there any concern about sending the wrong message to conservationists?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Helene, he was not aware -- I, in fact, and I believe none of our team was aware of this report until you mentioned it to me this morning.\xc2\xa0 The President enjoyed his visit to Chinatown, and, as you know, ordered a lot of dim sum takeout. No soup.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you encouraged by Iran\'s overtures?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 By?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Iran\'s overtures?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do you mean the response to the letter?\xc2\xa0 Well, as I noted I think yesterday, we have long made clear that the Iranians needed to respond to the letter from Lady Ashton on behalf of the P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 We have always said that talks remain\xc2\xa0 -- we remain willing to engage in talks with the Iranians so long as they have a constructive approach to those negotiations, and that means a constructive approach that understands that the purpose is for Iran to live up to its international obligations and to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re still evaluating the letter and so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a detailed analysis of it for you, but the fact is that the policy this President put in place of both making clear to the Iranians that there was a path to reengagement with the international community through constructive behavior and adherence to their obligations on the one hand, and then an alternative path of economic destruction caused by the most severe sanctions regime in history and diplomatic isolation brought about by rogue behavior and a refusal to honor its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 Those two paths -- that approach of making clear that these two options were available to the Iranian leadership has had the effect of putting enormous pressure on Iran.\xc2\xa0 And we remain committed to a policy that aims to prevent Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you link that to the sanctions that have gone into effect?\xc2\xa0 I mean, clearly this is an effort by Iran to sort of derail -- they\xe2\x80\x99ll offer to talk and talk.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no plan at this point for this administration to step back from the sanctions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That is correct.\xc2\xa0 The sanctions have had a positive -- well, they\'ve had a harmful effect on the Iranian economy, a disruptive effect on the Iranian regime, and that was the intention.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to pressure and isolate Iran unless and until it changes its behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to be touring the Dreamliner today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Have we not put out any paper on what today\xe2\x80\x99s event is?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t see if there\xe2\x80\x99s -- is he going on the 787?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on a second.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. LEWIN:\xc2\xa0 we have background we\'ll send out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just curious -- it\'s a new plane -- if he\'s looking forward to going on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is definitely looking forward to it.\xc2\xa0 That is part of the program event.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been on there -- on one of those before?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll double-check.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since we\'re going to Washington, Washington State legalized same-sex marriage this month.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, Governor Christie is promising to veto a bill legalizing same-sex marriage that passed the New Jersey assembly.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering what does the President think about Washington State\xe2\x80\x99s decision and then Governor Christie\xe2\x80\x99s vow to veto legislation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say only broadly, as I have said in the past, without weighing into individual states and their actions, that this President strongly supports the notion that the states should be able to decide this issue, and he opposes actions that take away rights that have been established by those states.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not going to comment specifically on individual states.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is his view on same-sex marriage, though, still evolving?\xc2\xa0 Or how would you describe it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no update for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he having fun on this trip?\xc2\xa0 Does he enjoy these fundraisers that he\'s been doing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has enjoyed this trip.\xc2\xa0 He enjoys talking to supporters, hearing their ideas, their sense of how it\'s going out there and how the economy is doing, how the campaign effort is going, in terms of the campaign side of this trip.\xc2\xa0 And obviously he very much enjoys just getting out of Washington and engaging with people and hearing their views on what\'s going on in the country and the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What has he heard from like -- I mean, these are pretty high-end fundraisers.\xc2\xa0 What kinds of things is he hearing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Some of them are high end, some of them are very low-dollar events, as you know.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I\'d point you to the campaign, but I think my understanding is the support this President has received from small donors is quite indicative of the broad grassroots support that\'s out there for him and his agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think there\'s a sense that is reflected among the people who come out to support him for these events that is true broadly, and we\'ve seen it anecdotally as well as in public opinion surveys in your newspapers and others, that people are feeling marginally better about the direction of the country, and most specifically, the economy.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no question that the recovery is progressing.\xc2\xa0 We have had sustained economic growth and sustained private sector job growth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we take nothing for granted in terms of further economic progress.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why passage of this payroll tax cut extension and unemployment insurance extension is so important -- because we are on the right path, we are moving in the right direction, and it is essential that Washington, A, does everything that\'s possible to further the recovery, and B, does nothing to muck it up.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why, as I said, extension of the payroll tax cut is vital to continuing to grow the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- on the Zoellick replacement, the status of talks of who you guys are looking at?\xc2\xa0 Is it at a staff level, or is the President actively involved in it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no further information on that process.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in light of the Boeing visit today, what does the President think of this contention from U.S. air carriers, including Delta, that the export policies have benefited foreign carriers in terms of financing planes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would have to get back to you with a more complete response, but this President believes that the policies that the administration has pursued, including with regard to his export agenda, have been broadly beneficial to manufacture and export of American products.\xc2\xa0 And that would include large and small products.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t we get to see Al Green\'s sing -- that was a bummer.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 It was pretty amazing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- we could hear it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has some serious pipes.\xc2\xa0 He can sing.\xc2\xa0 It was really nice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President sing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you heard the President make -- comment on that.\xc2\xa0 I think he said it best.\xc2\xa0 He was just there to talk about his agenda.\xc2\xa0 But I know he enjoyed -- although he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the room, he was down the hall, but he heard some of Al Green singing and I know he enjoyed it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The people, they just all sat in their seats, there was no, like, dancing or cheering -- or what was it like in there?\xc2\xa0 Because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to see any of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 People were sort of clapping along and cheering and stuff.\xc2\xa0 Nobody stood up.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s kind of a slowish song, I guess, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He was good.</p>\n<p>\n\tIs that it?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END 9:35 A.M. PST</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tADDENDUM</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All of us, from the President on down, are greatly saddened by the news that Anthony Shadid had died while reporting in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Anthony Shadid was one of the best, perhaps the finest, foreign correspondent working today, in my opinion -- for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a tragic loss to journalism, to The New York Times, most importantly to his family.\xc2\xa0 And our thoughts and prayers, the President\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts and prayers are with his wife and children.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did you ever (inaudible) with him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not as a reporter, but he was in Iraq some when I was there with the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 I just was a great admirer of his work.\xc2\xa0 And the most important thing is that he took extraordinary risks in order to give voice to the popular movements within the Arab world, within the region.\xc2\xa0 And it was because of some of the risks he took that leaders around the world were aware of things that were happening and changes that were taking place in the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact that he was in Syria speaks exactly to that, where were it not for Anthony or reporters like him, we would know a lot less about the absolute brutality of the Assad regime and the democratic aspirations of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a great, great loss.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
