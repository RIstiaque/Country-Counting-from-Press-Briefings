EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0As you all saw, obviously, this morning, the President made an important announcement about a final agreement that shuts down every path that Iran has to a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the agreement is detailed and long, but in general, it would reduce Iran\xe2\x80\x99s uranium stockpile by 98 percent. \xc2\xa0It obviously would close the reactor, or at least remodel, refurbish the reactor that would allow them -- that previously had allowed them to make weaponized plutonium. \xc2\xa0Iran would commit to removing 13,000 centrifuges, and they would have to cooperate with the most intrusive inspections program that\xe2\x80\x99s ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you all know, the President placed some telephone calls to some foreign leaders today, including the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the Foreign Minister for the EU, all of whom were intimately involved in the negotiation of this agreement. \xc2\xa0The President also had the opportunity to speak with Prime Minister Netanyahu today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in addition to that, senior administration officials have been in close touch with members of Congress in both parties, many of whom have demonstrated an interest, shall we say, in this particular issue and the efforts to reach this agreement. \xc2\xa0So those consultations -- extensive consultations have already begun. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the other thing that I wanted to let you know is that tomorrow afternoon, prior to leaving for Oklahoma, the President will convene a news conference in the East Room of the White House to discuss this agreement further and to take some of your questions about this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s apparent that we\xe2\x80\x99ve come a long way, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple more things and then we can get to your questions. \xc2\xa0We have come a long way, but we have not gone as far as the New Horizons spacecraft that has traveled more than 3 billion miles, and has, as of today, reached Pluto. \xc2\xa0The spacecraft is taking pictures and collecting data that will be analyzed to learn more about the planet\xe2\x80\x99s composition, its atmosphere and its moons. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s another piece of news today.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then I also command to your attention the President\xe2\x80\x99s discussion this afternoon of criminal justice and juvenile justice reforms that will make our country more fair, our communities safer by reducing recidivism, and saving taxpayer dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo a lot on the agenda today. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President intend or have any plans to speak with President Rouhani?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, no. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls like that to tell you about, but --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you like to?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously, at the beginning of this process, the President did have the opportunity to communicate with the Iranian President. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what\xe2\x80\x99s clear, Josh, is that while this agreement is important and certainly addresses among the more significant concerns that the United States has with Iran, we have not resolved all of our concerns. \xc2\xa0To say the least, we have continuing concerns as it relates to their continued unjust detention of American citizens, their continued threats that are directed toward Israel, their continued support for destabilizing activities in the region. \xc2\xa0So we certainly continue to have a lot of concerns with Iran and its behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, what do you to critics who say that over the long term the President has moved off of conditions he himself had set for these negotiations and has accepted things that at one point he indicated he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Peter, I think what I would -- I\xe2\x80\x99d just go back to where we were at the top, which was that the original goal of entering into these diplomatic negotiations was to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0There was never a suggestion that these negotiations would resolve either the United States\xe2\x80\x99 or the broader international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut when it comes to the goal of, in a verifiable way, preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, that goal has been achieved.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But even in terms of the nuclear -- forgetting the issues of terrorism and other concerns that people have with Iran, he\xe2\x80\x99s accepted a deal that does not match what he had set out specifically in terms of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program -- in terms of centrifuges, in terms of some of the facilities, that kind of thing; they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to keep Fordow, they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to -- even though they have to limit it, they have still have centrifuges there. \xc2\xa0I mean, these are things some of which did not seem to be what he envisioned at the beginning of the negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think that what the President has been focused on is this goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And through a rigorous, exhaustive set of negotiations, that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s been achieved. \xc2\xa0And this is an agreement that is not rooted in trust, it\xe2\x80\x99s rooted in our ability to verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd by following through on those verification measures, we can ensure that Iran is living up to the commitment that they\xe2\x80\x99ve now made to have a nuclear program that exists solely for peaceful purposes. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But given the consultations with Congress that he has made and his staff has made in the last 24 hours, are you prepared to say today you expect there to be a vote to disapprove this? \xc2\xa0And do you think that you would prevail without having to use a veto? \xc2\xa0Or are you expecting to be able to use -- are you expecting to use your veto to stop such a disapproval?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I routinely hesitate to predict congressional outcomes. \xc2\xa0But I do think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a large number of public statements from members of Congress, and I know that many have observed that there are not very many surprising statements from members of Congress on either side, frankly. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of that. \xc2\xa0We are going to continue to encourage members of Congress to try to keep as open a mind as possible to evaluate this agreement on the merits. \xc2\xa0There will be constructive engagement with Congress in the hopes that they will do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe feel confident that when members of Congress are able -- if members of Congress are able to set aside their own political, partisan identity and actually focus on the details of the agreement, that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot in here to like as it relates to advancing the interests of the United States. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible) partisan, but a lot of the critics are Democrats, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Some of them. \xc2\xa0But again, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make a case to them as well. \xc2\xa0And there will be additional conversations. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident there will be extensive briefings on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0Many of the documents that have been negotiated have already been made public, so there already is an opportunity for the public and members of Congress to evaluate this agreement. \xc2\xa0I think that is an indication of the confidence that we have in this agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, if all goes well, European businesses are going to be able to resume doing business with Iran, but obviously U.S. businesses won\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0Is that fair? \xc2\xa0And how does the President look at that and feel about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Roberta, you raised a good point, which is that there continue to be significant bilateral sanctions between the United States and Iran because of some of the other concerns the United States has with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior that I referenced earlier. \xc2\xa0And the President continues to believe that keeping those kinds of sanctions in place and continuing to pressure Iran to release Americans who are unjustly detained to stop their support for terrorism, to menacing Israel -- those continue to be national security priorities. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have worked effectively with the international community to address this one element of our concerns with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior. \xc2\xa0But there are others. \xc2\xa0And we\'re going to continue to use all of the instruments at our disposal to protect the interests of the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that U.S. businesses will be put at a competitive disadvantage to their European competitors in this market?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, this is a tradeoff that we have acknowledged and has existed for quite some time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask some timing questions? \xc2\xa0I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s plans to submit the resolution to the U.N. by next week -- or could it happen next week? \xc2\xa0When do you guys want that process to wrap up? \xc2\xa0And when do you plan to formally submit this to Congress to start the 60-day clock?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that both of those things are moving as quickly as possible. \xc2\xa0And so for an update on timing, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to Ambassador Power\xe2\x80\x99s office. \xc2\xa0They may be able to give you some more specific information than what you just cited to me. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the documentation that needs to be submitted to Congress, it is going to take a couple of days for us to make sure that the comprehensive set of documents has been provided to Congress as they requested. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that as quickly as possible, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get that up there as soon as we can.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was Senator Schumer among the lawmakers that President Obama talked to last night?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have a detailed list of those calls, but we can -- I don\'t know if we can get that to you today. \xc2\xa0But at some point we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to provide a more detailed list of the kinds of conversations that have taken place here in the early stages of this agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know the President talked to Secretary Clinton last night. \xc2\xa0Did he talk to any of the other Democratic presidential candidates to brief them on this plan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you elaborate on the call with Netanyahu at all? \xc2\xa0I mean, he had a similar call in March. \xc2\xa0How long did it last? \xc2\xa0Was it different in tenor? \xc2\xa0Was it more or less similar to that one?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have a lot of color. \xc2\xa0I know the intent at the beginning of that conversation was to have a direct exchange of views about what the President believes is -- what the President believes are the merits of this deal, both as it relates to the impact that this agreement would have on U.S. national security, but also the impact it would have on the national security of Israel who continues to be the closest ally of the United States in the Middle East. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there was an opportunity for the President to reiterate his firm commitment to continue the unprecedented level of security cooperation that exists between our two countries at the direction of President Obama.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is something that Prime Minister Netanyahu has referred to in the past. \xc2\xa0And the President reiterated his commitment to continuing that cooperation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, if Congress does move to undermine this and is able to override the President\xe2\x80\x99s veto, how far is he willing to go using his own executive authority to ease sanctions on Iran? \xc2\xa0Will he do that unilaterally?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Josh, at this point, that\'s not a scenario that we think is going to happen. \xc2\xa0And there is some evidence to indicate that there is strong support, particularly among the Democratic caucus in the House of Representatives. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that there was a letter signed earlier this spring by a large number of Democrats, enough Democrats to sustain the President\xe2\x80\x99s veto, indicating that they were supportive of the ongoing efforts to reach a final agreement consistent with the principles that are laid out -- that were laid out in the Lausanne agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the final agreement that was announced today didn\'t just meet the parameters that were established in the Lausanne agreement; in many important areas, the parameters of that agreement were actually exceeded by the United States and our P5+1 partners. \xc2\xa0So we continue to have confidence that we will be able to earn the strong support of at least of those members of Congress who signed that letter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What can you say about Vice President Biden standing over the President\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder today? \xc2\xa0I can\'t remember a time a Vice President stood over the President\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder for a kind of straight-to-camera kind of national television address like that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, frankly, this is actually an issue that Vice President Biden has been working on for a long time, even prior to entering the White House. \xc2\xa0And the President last night invited him to stand with him as he made this announcement. \xc2\xa0And I think it should send a pretty clear signal to everybody across the country and around the world about the sustained commitment that was required on the part of the United States to reach this agreement, and the firm commitment on the part of the administration to implement it effectively.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Soleimani, the sanctions against him, the unilateral U.S. ones, remain. \xc2\xa0Can you just outline exactly how those sanctions are lifted? \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of debate over those being lifted at all.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s highly technical, so I don\'t want to make a mistake. \xc2\xa0But let me send you to the Treasury Department who can give you detailed accounting of how exactly that works. \xc2\xa0There was some --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The unilateral, though, remain?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There was some confusion early on today about a gentleman with the same name in Iran, or at least a similar name in Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But both are on the sanction relief lift.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me have the Treasury Department follow up with you. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s exceedingly technical, and so I just don\'t want to steer you wrong on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, on conventional weapons, the deal is also a little bit vague about what happens with those. \xc2\xa0There are supposed to be some U.N. resolutions -- five years for one type, eight years for another. \xc2\xa0Are you confident that the U.N. will pass those resolutions? \xc2\xa0And are five and eight years enough for the respective conventional weapons sanctions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The five years refers to the arms embargo that the U.N. put in place against Iran; the eight years refers to the sanctions related to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missiles program. \xc2\xa0We are confident that the U.N. resolution will pass because it was the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council that were a party to this negotiation. \xc2\xa0So they\xe2\x80\x99ve already signed off on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, the reason that this is something that the United States was able to go along with is that these were specific sanctions or embargoes that did apply to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program. \xc2\xa0That\'s the reason they were put in place in the first place. \xc2\xa0That\'s the reason that they were subject for the negotiation. \xc2\xa0And there is a long list of both unilateral and bilateral measures that the United States has in place to limit the transfer of equipment and technology related to -- or that could be used to advance either Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program or to facilitate the transfer of arms.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I can get you a more comprehensive list of the kinds of measures that remain in place, even after the U.N. takes action, and even after the five and eight years\xe2\x80\x99 timeframe has expired that will limit Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missiles and conventional arms capabilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it fair to say that none of the red lines Khamenei drew in the sand were crossed? \xc2\xa0We didn\'t get unfettered access, the lifting the bans embargo. \xc2\xa0All of the sanctions are lifted at once.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let him talk about the red lines that he drew. \xc2\xa0What I can tell you is that our goal was to make sure that a final agreement reflected the parameters of the agreement that was reached in Lausanne earlier this spring, back the first week in April. \xc2\xa0And when it comes to things like access, addressing concerns related to the potential military dimensions of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, when it comes to verification measures that can ensure that Iran is complying with the agreement -- all those things were codified in the final agreement, consistent with the way that they were laid out in the Lausanne agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But we never crossed their red lines. \xc2\xa0They got what they wanted in the end, in that way.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we were less concerned about -- as I mentioned earlier, we were less concerned about the statements coming from the other side and more interested in the actions. \xc2\xa0And we were very focused on ensuring that a final agreement lived up to the parameters that were established in the interim agreement in Lausanne, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what happened.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, can we get a quick preview of the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic opportunity event tomorrow? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President will travel to the Choctaw Nation tomorrow afternoon after the news conference. \xc2\xa0The Choctaw Nation was designated as a Promise Zone by President Obama a couple of years ago, and the Choctaw Nation has effectively used much of the federal assistance that they\xe2\x80\x99ve received as a result of that designation to make investments in their community and their people in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s expanded economic opportunity for local members of the community there. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on that for you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can we do a quick one on criminal justice? \xc2\xa0Are we expecting the President to lay out concrete legislative asks or goals today or later this week? \xc2\xa0Or is it just going to be a general call for --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the President will talk about some of his priorities. \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect legislative language to come up in his remarks, but I do think that you can look for the President to send a pretty clear signal about at least what some of his priorities would be in criminal justice and juvenile justice reform legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There are some executive orders that he can make in those areas. \xc2\xa0Does he plan to do that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President demonstrated a willingness earlier this week to take pretty bold executive action to address some of the disparities in our criminal justice system, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out the President using that kind of authority in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, what about things like clean-slate rules, block-the-box for federal contractors?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate any announcements along those lines today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, quick question. \xc2\xa0On Monday, Cuba and the United States restore normal diplomatic relations. \xc2\xa0Is there any update on Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Cuba now that he\xe2\x80\x99s on his way back from Vienna?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what his travel plans are for next week, but you can check with the State Department. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t3:34 P.M.
