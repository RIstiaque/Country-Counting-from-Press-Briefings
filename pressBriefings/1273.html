GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Gibbs, a few questions about the terror threat aimed at Europe to start with.\xc2\xa0 First of all, does the White House, the administration, have any reason to believe that that threat applies to the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ben, just let me talk largely for a second.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the alert that was issued by the State Department is based on information about potential threats in Europe.\xc2\xa0 We want travelers to be alert and aware.\xc2\xa0 The particular threat information, as I said, deals with Europe and isn\xe2\x80\x99t related to the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, we certainly know that al Qaeda and its affiliates seek to do us harm and attack us here.\xc2\xa0 So we are -- we remain vigilant about protecting our homeland.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s all I have to say about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you update us on the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities as it relates to this over the last day or so in terms of briefings or calls to other world leaders?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am not aware of other calls.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the team at State and inside the building have worked in conjunction with our European allies in talking through information and steps that we\'re taking.\xc2\xa0 The President was briefed on this on Saturday here in the White House.\xc2\xa0 I assume there was some discussion about this in the daily briefing, but I don\'t have anything specific.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some people who this applies to or traveling in Europe can find this kind of unnerving.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re asked to be more vigilant but not really sure exactly what that means as they\xe2\x80\x99re going about a trip or seeing family members.\xc2\xa0 What does the President -- what\xe2\x80\x99s his message?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, first and foremost, let me say this.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously an extensive amount of information on the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s website.\xc2\xa0 This is --in many ways, I think you should think of this as taking some very common-sense, precautionary steps -- again, many of those are listed on the website with the alert.\xc2\xa0 This is not a warning, travel warning, telling people not to go.\xc2\xa0 This is simply to raise awareness and alertness of those that are there -- report specific activity; be very aware of your surroundings.\xc2\xa0 That stuff is listed on the website and I think those are -- many precautions that are good to bear in mind as you continue traveling in Europe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, are you aware if the administration has received any pushback from European allies about this alert from the State Department, particularly as it could affect tourism there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Ben, none that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 We have worked in conjunction with our close European allies on this.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the British took a similar -- or issued a similar alert for its citizens traveling in parts of Europe.\xc2\xa0 So we have for many days been working deeply in conjunction with those in Europe.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an entire continent.\xc2\xa0 Why so broad?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, to give the best available information for those traveling in the area to be alert.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And a U.S. drone strike killed eight Germans in Pakistan today.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any information about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, and if I did, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get into it, no.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about these reports that you may be leaving us for the DNC?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to what I said on Saturday about that.\xc2\xa0 People in this building are focused on what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing here now, much like I am.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy doing what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does that mean you\xe2\x80\x99re staying around?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes or no?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you ruling it out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had any conversations about it, so --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are you thinking in your mind -- not about conversations -- are you thinking about staying or leaving?\xc2\xa0 Is it a possibility?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April, I love my job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We all love our jobs, but sometimes --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say the ferociousness with which you\xe2\x80\x99re asking this question might be a signal to your employer that you have some deep-seated --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no, no -- I love my job.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know what, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about my job.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of talk about what kind of legislation the Congress might consider after the elections, during the lame duck session.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President would have any problem with any specific legislation passed in lame duck.\xc2\xa0 For instance, would he be concerned at all if an energy bill, a major energy bill, were passed, finalized, in a lame duck?\xc2\xa0 Would he be concerned at all about a major immigration bill passed, finalized, sent to his desk from lame duck?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know what that would mean based on -- we obviously need to look through --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean as a philosophical concept, not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to sign off on legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would just say this, Jake.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously -- and I mentioned this last week here -- there are a number of important things that need to -- that continue to need to be done that didn\xe2\x80\x99t get done at the end of the regular legislative session.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got a START treaty that we believe needs to be ratified through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Obviously a fairly large tax debate is going to have to be settled before the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 We have the reauthorization of the children\xe2\x80\x99s nutrition program.\xc2\xa0 There are a whole host of judgeships that have languished for far too long.\xc2\xa0 And I anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a new budget director that will be confirmed by the full Senate.\xc2\xa0 So there are a number of things that certainly have to be done.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t look into my crystal ball in terms of what you said.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President continues to believe that energy and immigration are tremendously important priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would they be important -- let\xe2\x80\x99s specifically talk about energy and immigration because they\xe2\x80\x99re obviously -- it\xe2\x80\x99s vast and bold legislation; it\xe2\x80\x99s controversial legislation; it\xe2\x80\x99s legislation that there have been problems with introducing during the Congress.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that because they are so big that they should be considered by the next Congress, or would he be okay philosophically with immigration or energy being addressed by a lame duck Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, Jake, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get around the hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 Obviously these are issues that -- look, let\xe2\x80\x99s take immigration.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been very clear that -- and the courts, in many ways, upheld that we can\xe2\x80\x99t have a patchwork of immigration laws for every state in the country or every border state in the country.\xc2\xa0 That just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of sense.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously the President was supportive of the Senate taking up and passing the DREAM Act before Congress adjourned, and that obviously didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xc2\xa0 We continue to look for ways to work with Democrats and Republicans to move forward on immigration.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just to follow up on the threat.\xc2\xa0 Is it a -- can it be described as a new threat, or a series of patterns that are leading authorities to believe --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dan, for a lot of reasons I don\'t want to get into the nature of our intelligence.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we are concerned enough to alert those that are in Europe to be alert to their surroundings.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s job is in issuing such an alert, to ensure that those that are traveling, that they\'re aware of that and that they remain safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did something change from perhaps like last week or the last two weeks?\xc2\xa0 Was there something that -- specific that happened that led to this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say, look, we have been tracking various threats for a while.\xc2\xa0 This is -- I don\'t think this is tremendously out of the norm in terms of ensuring that those that are traveling in Europe are aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s out there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the next two years, how does the President view going into the next two years?\xc2\xa0 Sort of as he sits back, what is his vision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to finish -- Dan, I don\'t want to write the rest of this year since it\xe2\x80\x99s the first week in October.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of stuff, as I just mentioned to Jake, that we need to get done.\xc2\xa0 And, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have time to think through and next year or the year after that, at some later date, we -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you, we have not spent any real amount of time discussing legislative tactics or a strategy for January. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot left to do in October and November.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, I mean, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say when he\xe2\x80\x99s out talking about what\xe2\x80\x99s important to the American people and what\xe2\x80\x99s important to him, a number of legislative priorities that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t finished.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, I mentioned a few -- Jake mentioned a few, I mentioned a few in terms of what we need to do to continue to finish the business that the President saw that we have this year.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what our focus is.</p>\n<p>\n\tChip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 In one of the statements that came out over the weekend on the terrorism in Europe situation, it said, from the day that we became aware of this latest plot, the President made clear we need to do everything possible to disrupt this plot.\xc2\xa0 Is it a specific plot that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip, I -- obviously, I think that sort of speaks for itself.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get into the nature of our intelligence as it relates to all this.\xc2\xa0 Again, as I said a minute ago, we have been tracking streams and threats for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 The President has -- meets frequently with his counterterrorism team both in the Situation Room and in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 He has made sure to ask them what tools they may need to deal with threats that are either overseas or those that could impact here at home, and to do all that we can to share information and to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking all of the necessary precautions as it relates to those threats.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe know and we have known for quite some time -- and this isn\xe2\x80\x99t based on anything that you read there -- that al Qaeda and its extremist affiliates seek to do us harm here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned earlier that the State Department and his team here are -- is dealing with them.\xc2\xa0 Is he also dealing with heads of intelligence agencies and speaking with them directly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that, as it relates to that, my sense is that that\xe2\x80\x99s happening at CIA and with John Brennan.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re interacting with many of those.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the NSC writ large is dealing with their counterparts all over the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On politics, if you could put your DNC hat on for just a moment-- (laughter) -- was that the first you had heard of it in any way whatsoever?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not had any discussions with anybody here about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you had discussions with anybody outside?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how -- I said on Saturday I have not been involved in any conversations -- here, there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here, there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I was in Alabama.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to anybody there about it.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to anybody in Virginia about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anybody on your behalf?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ethan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Let me tell you, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure for Ethan DNC does not stand for what it stands for with you.\xc2\xa0 So I\xc2\xa0 -- no, I\'m not involved in that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, getting past that, do you share the assessment -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You just let him get into another question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you share, and does the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does DNC stand for with Ethan.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Daddy -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Do you share the assessment of some Democrats in the last few days that things are tightening, that things are not looking as bad for Democrats in the election?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think you have seen over the course of several weeks, you see a tightening in the public polling, if you look at the generic ballot.\xc2\xa0 You see a tightening in the so-called enthusiasm gap.\xc2\xa0 Those on Democratic and Republican sides that talked to pollsters and say that they are certain to vote in the next election, I think you have seen a tightening in that.\xc2\xa0 I think part of that is a broader swath of the electorate now focusing more broadly, quite honestly, on the upcoming elections.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere have been a whole host of things that have helped that.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has made the case effectively about why people need to be involved and what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake, and I think those -- look, I think those trends will continue up until Election Day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you still believe the Democrats could lose the House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I still believe that the Democrats will control the House after Election Day in 2010.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Senate?\xc2\xa0 Is it in jeopardy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ll control both after the election.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No doubts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following on that, it still sounds like obviously the margins will be different probably after the election.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not making a prediction one way or the other.\xc2\xa0 Is there thoughts internally about how this may affect the legislative approach on the Hill about -- conventional wisdom is kind of the first two years for the big things and perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll go for singles as opposed to homeruns from this point forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\'ll say this, unrelated to the question.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have a couple of things that are important to what we did in the past two years that will be important going forward.\xc2\xa0 And that is implementing both health care reform and Wall Street reform -- obviously, as you mentioned, pretty robust legislative packages that have to be -- many facets that have to be implemented.\xc2\xa0 We have not spent any appreciable period of time, though, here worrying about or thinking about legislative tactics and strategy for next January. We just haven\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to say whether he will follow President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s approach, perhaps, and go toward the center?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I -- there just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got, what, is it four weeks from tomorrow until Election Day.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the political calendar, that\'s what the focus is on, not several months from now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will Pete Rouse mean perhaps a different relationship with the Hill, compared to with Rahm being the Chief of Staff?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, look, we discussed, I think, their fairly obvious stylistic differences.\xc2\xa0 Look, Pete has been very involved in dealing with the Hill in his role as a senior advisor.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Pete has got relationships on Capitol Hill that go back longer than the -- certainly longer than the President has been here.\xc2\xa0 And in different legislative battles, those relationships -- he\xe2\x80\x99s used his knowledge of and relationships with different senators to talk to them about issues.\xc2\xa0 So I think in many ways Pete was very involved in strategy relating to Capitol Hill, and obviously as chief of staff will have an even larger role in that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have three questions, two on politics, one on the terror alert.\xc2\xa0 Just to get a sense of what you expect people to do with the information about the travel alert, what would you -- if you had a conversation with your close relative or family -- or sibling or friend, what would you tell them, if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to Paris or Rome or Berlin?\xc2\xa0 How should they act differently?\xc2\xa0 What plans should they change or avoid?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say, again, and I will mention, if you go to travel.state.gov there\xe2\x80\x99s a list of things that are important:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, in terms of being aware of your surroundings, understanding how to move throughout those surroundings; where to go in the event of an emergency; how to act in terms of traveling alone, traveling at night; things that are important to be aware of -- again, suspicious activity, who to go to, what to tell them, and what to be on the lookout for.\xc2\xa0 All of those I think are -- I mean, look, that\xe2\x80\x99s a very cursory top line of I think that people should be thinking about when they -- if they\xe2\x80\x99re traveling and what they need to be cognizant of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell people close to you to be worried or overly concerned?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, we would not -- let me take this from a governmental perspective.\xc2\xa0 We would not be advising administration officials to do something differently than we would be advising the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the example I would use is General Jones is in Europe today.\xc2\xa0 So the information that came out Sunday was an alert to -- again, just to do that:\xc2\xa0 to make people aware of and alert to that information, not to dissuade them from travel there in the beginning.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then after the midterms in terms of the legislative agenda, how concerned are you -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of talk among Republicans about wanting to defund or stand in the way, block implementation, which you just brought up, of things like the health care bill.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the White House about those efforts and how success they could be if the dynamics change?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously some of that would depend on what the numbers end up being.\xc2\xa0 Again, as related to earlier questions, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll wake up the day after still with majorities in both the House and the Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, I think you have heard the President talk about, and other officials talk about, what walking away from health care reform would mean.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s gone into effect allows people that are sick not to be discriminated against.\xc2\xa0 It allows for preventive care to be administered without charge.\xc2\xa0 To walk away from that, we\xe2\x80\x99ve extended the life of Medicare.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made some tough decisions in health care that impact the deficit and debt in a positive way.\xc2\xa0 Walking away from that will have real-world implications that those opponents would have to -- or need to tell the American people what that would mean for real Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tWalking away from -- why on earth do you go back to -- and I know that Senator Cardin and others have talked about this as recently as just last week, going back to the rules that we had in place that related to Wall Street, that related to derivatives, that related to a whole host of risky financial transactions -- why you\xe2\x80\x99d want to go back to the same rules that we had that caused this, versus what\xe2\x80\x99s now in place to prevent something like this from happening, is, I think, a discussion that some Republicans are having with donors, but necessarily with voters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And final question.\xc2\xa0 Do you think you\xe2\x80\x99d do a good job as head of the DNC?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think we have a wonderful chairman at the DNC right now who is doing an extraordinary job.\xc2\xa0 And I think all you need to do is look at the news today at their ability to excite the base and the grassroots to contribute in the very same way that folks did in our election, and that was not -- they don\'t take money from PACs and lobbyists.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re getting small donations from people out in America.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said, and others in the White House have said, that many times you\xe2\x80\x99ve reached out your hand to Republicans, tried to work with them, and they just decided they wanted to be obstructionists and block --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 Mitch McConnell said that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, Mitch McConnell said in The New York Times that their strategy was to oppose everything.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said it, as well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, I\xe2\x80\x99ve quoted Mitch McConnell.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that the -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at how things deteriorated in Washington, that 100 percent of the blame goes on Republicans, or do you think that the White House and Democrats share some of the blame?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- look, I guess if you were to ask us if we\xe2\x80\x99d done 100 percent of everything right, the answer to that would be no.\xc2\xa0 But understand, again, it is -- bipartisanship has to be a two-way street, and if -- whether the example is Mitch McConnell saying that in the beginning we had a very defined strategy of opposing everything, which is borne out in many of the votes, or if -- the President still tells the story of we are -- I think we were in the Oval Office or the outer Oval Office; we\xe2\x80\x99re getting ready to get in the motorcade to go to Capitol Hill to meet with House Republicans and their caucus and talk about the Recovery Act, and somebody hands us a statement that says the Republican caucus is going to oppose it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that was before we could -- the cars were idling, but nobody was sitting in them to go up there and have a discussion about that before they said no.\xc2\xa0 I think it was a very well executed strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you are -- just to be clear, the White House does share some of the blame, or it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done 100 percent of everything right.\xc2\xa0 But if the leader of the House Republicans opposes an economic Recovery Act before the President even gets a chance to go up there and talk to the members of his caucus, minutes before he\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to arrive -- or the leader of the Senate Republicans says, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to say no to everything, I got to tell you, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get bipartisanship.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard when the leaders of both the House and the Senate of the Republican Party say, no.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason I ask is I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if looking ahead to next year, you feel the White House needs to make any adjustments in how you work with Republicans, or if it\xe2\x80\x99s up to them to change completely?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No -- well, if their strategy is --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean you can\xe2\x80\x99t -- just to be clear, I mean I don\'t expect you to speak for them.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking you to speak for yourself.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In this case I will.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t get them to cooperate on anything if their answer to everything is no.\xc2\xa0 If they\'re starting position is no -- look, who would have thought we would have judges who would sit for 230 or 240 days that pass out of a committee unanimously?\xc2\xa0 Who would have thought that somebody would sit up here and say that for three months a small business bill that cut and eliminated capital gains taxes on small business would be almost universally opposed by Republicans -- except for a few, obviously, in the Senate that helped get the bill through -- it\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented what they\xe2\x80\x99ve said no.</p>\n<p>\n\tI will say this.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten a decent number of questions today about sort of, what do you do in January, what do you -- our focus right now is on the remainder of October, November and December before we get to January.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like -- the take-away I get from that is that really it\xe2\x80\x99s up to them to change, that you guys have, for the most part, done what you need to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have -- the President has reached out to and asked Republicans to participate in the activity that we know of as government.\xc2\xa0 Regrettably, the strategy from the very beginning, from Mitch McConnell to those that serve in the Senate, from John Boehner, from those that serve on the Republican side in the House, was to say no.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to overcome that when there is a specific strategy of saying no that comes from the leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got two questions about fuel and fuel shipments in two different places.\xc2\xa0 What, if anything, is the administration doing to get fuel and other supplies across the border from Pakistan to Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0 And -- well, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you my second one.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously we are in discussions and working with the government of Pakistan to address the concerns relating to the closure of the border there.\xc2\xa0 We believe we are close to yielding -- close to producing some results on that and may have more on that in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At what level are those discussions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe they\xe2\x80\x99re happening right now at the Department of State.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With their diplomats?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the other fuel question, Robert, is what, if anything, is the administration doing to stop the flow of fuel, fuel trucks specifically, going from Iraq into Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any guidance on that but let me try to find something from NSC right after this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the first one, you said \xe2\x80\x9cin the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How far in the future?\xc2\xa0 Could it be today or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re working government to government.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have expressed our condolences for what happened several days ago in Pakistan with ISAF and their forces, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working through the border closing right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you aware of the shipments from Iraq into Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some information on all of that up to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might the new political climate after the election present an opportunity for the administration to renew efforts reaching out to business -- the business community to try and find places of agreement on the legislative issues you mention like climate change or immigration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re continually looking for opportunities to work with business.\xc2\xa0 I think today\xe2\x80\x99s event in focusing on the -- working -- a public-private partnership with business on addressing the skills challenge, certainly that\'s one.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a whole host of things.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, energy, immigration and many others present opportunities to work Democrats, Republicans, business, labor across the political spectrum get some of that stuff done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it important for the administration to appear to be pro-business?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it is -- obviously, the President is very focused on being pro-American business overseas, increasing our exports.\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 The steps that have been taken to secure financial stability, to secure and strengthen the recovery, to ensure that auto companies don\'t go bankrupt and out of business, I think is very pro-business.\xc2\xa0 I think had the economic situation been allowed to get worse, I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that business would have seen a recovery without consumer demand.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does being pro-biz include being pro-Wall Street?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we want to make sure that what\xe2\x80\x99s good for Wall Street is good for Main Street.\xc2\xa0 We have to ensure that there are rules and responsibilities for everyone -- not a new set of rules or just one set of rules for Wall Street.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat was -- the common-sense sort of axiom behind Wall Street reform was we had to have a set of rules that worked for everybody.\xc2\xa0 We had to have a set of rules that ensured that those on Wall Street had responsibility for their actions, and that we didn\'t unnecessarily weigh heavy risk-taking ahead of everything else.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give a sense of what the next four weeks is going to look like in terms of the President campaigning?\xc2\xa0 It seems like you suggested that you feel like Obama has been an effective messenger.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like there are certain venues that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a block in front of me in terms of his schedule.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, just this week, he\xe2\x80\x99s -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a DNC event, I believe.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m doing this from memory, so -- I think he travels to New Jersey on Wednesday, to P.G. County and Illinois on Thursday, and then I think on Sunday, he\xe2\x80\x99s in Philadelphia.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the whole block in front of me, but obviously, I think the President is going to be out there making the case and discussing what he thinks is at stake in this election.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a sense of whether or not like rallies are effective in a way that say, backyard barbecues aren\xe2\x80\x99t?\xc2\xa0 Or is there going to be a similar mix?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President will continue to do a mix of different events.\xc2\xa0 I think -- look, I think the anecdotal information that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten in Wisconsin around the Madison event has been quite positive.</p>\n<p>\n\tChristi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you said earlier that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference in sensibility, or I think you said style between Pete Rouse and Rahm Emanuel.\xc2\xa0 But I wonder in a broader sense if you can talk about the personnel changes that are being contemplated that we already know about in the White House staff. Is the President looking to change direction at all, tweak things in a particular way?\xc2\xa0 Or is it -- is the guiding principle more to continue the course?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think, first and foremost, as I talked about last week, prior to any change in personnel in the chief of staff\xe2\x80\x99s office, Pete was undertaking, again, a very natural reorganization as we were ending the natural life expectancy of some staffers\xe2\x80\x99 work here.\xc2\xa0 People were, not surprisingly after two years, going to go back to teaching, going back to business or what have you.\xc2\xa0 And so he was undertaking that project.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd obviously some of those -- the President is weighing through some of these decisions and some personnel changes based on people leaving.\xc2\xa0 And obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot, honestly, Christi, that goes into any of these picks.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have people that work together, people that drive a policy process, people that come up with ideas.\xc2\xa0 There are a whole host of different things and some of it depends on who\xe2\x80\x99s already there around, in the group where a job opening is impactful or is in that realm of those issue areas -- for instance, looking for an NEC director that complements all of the other members of the economic team as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there\xe2\x80\x99s just one thing that anybody is looking for.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a whole host of different decisions, all of which go into those personnel changes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, three questions.\xc2\xa0 Can you discuss now, since it\xe2\x80\x99s Monday, the rally that happened Saturday and its significance to the midterm elections as it relates to your base?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I think that the President and the folks that are working here, as well as folks in the Democratic base, understand what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake four weeks from tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 They understand the work that\xe2\x80\x99s been done and the work that\xe2\x80\x99s left to do.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- look, our hopes of what we want to see out of this election are largely the same, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work with folks on the Democratic side of the aisle as well as folks that want to on the Republican side of the aisle to make progress on those issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, on the terror alert in Europe, can you specifically talk about some things, any nuances, about this hunt for Osama bin Laden as this new terror alert --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s my place to get into the nature of our intelligence, except to discuss what the alert does, what it means, and that the President meets regularly with the counterterrorism team to ensure that they have all that they need to keep us safe here at home and abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he concerned himself that it\xe2\x80\x99s taken this long to capture Osama bin Laden?\xc2\xa0 Granted he is one part of a whole --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, April, I doubt that anybody has stood here in the last -- this administration or the two previous that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t liked to have captured or killed Osama bin Laden by now. You can -- I think that\'s certainly the case.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to take the steps necessary to keep us safe from him and others like him who plot and plan to do us harm.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the last question to you:\xc2\xa0 You know the importance of words, and you\xe2\x80\x99re very strategic in what you say to us, especially from that podium.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say -- (laughter) -- I\xe2\x80\x99m looking out, there\xe2\x80\x99s a fastball coming.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a fastball.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Well, brace yourself, okay?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a curve.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a curve.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is a hanging curve.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m digging in.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say for sure -- stop it -- (laughter) -- can you say for sure that you love this job that much that you\xe2\x80\x99re not even considering the DNC?\xc2\xa0 I want a straight answer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wow.\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I do love this job.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had any conversations about the future.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to have any conversations about the future in the next few weeks because -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean this to be sarcastic, but everybody that works here is focused on the thousands and thousands of things on their to-do list that they have to do every day.\xc2\xa0 I promise you I was here almost all of Saturday on what might well be considered one of the prettiest -- last pretty days of the year.\xc2\xa0 I would love to have been running around outside, but there were tons of things to do here and we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on doing those.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m hanging on every word you say -- (laughter) -- and you said the next few weeks you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have any conversations.\xc2\xa0 So what happens in the next couple of weeks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, April, I am happy to answer questions about the travel alert.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to answer questions about --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You are the news.\xc2\xa0 You are the news --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- no, it was in the -- we got it Saturday.\xc2\xa0 You are the news.\xc2\xa0 You could be leaving.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re the President\xe2\x80\x99s mouthpiece and you could possibly -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not flattering him, but seriously -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s obviously not flattering me.\xc2\xa0 Who in the world thought she was flattering me?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no -- but you are the President\xe2\x80\x99s mouthpiece --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 And you know what, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try to be --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and then to leave here to go over to run the DNC --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am going to try to be -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try to just give the information on a whole host of issues that I know are far more important than me.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No flattery -- no flattery --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not coming over there to get flattery, I know that, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got two really important ones on Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration still believe that the two governments are strong allies, or have they been co-opted by the Taliban and al Qaeda?\xc2\xa0 And do you think the American --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Are we talking about Afghanistan and Pakistan?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have strong and important partnerships with Afghanistan and a strong -- in Pakistan, a strong ally in common pursuits to address extremism and the threat that it poses.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I mean, we would not be in Afghanistan were it not in their interest and our interest for us to be there to ensure that what the Taliban once held in control they don\xe2\x80\x99t ever control again, because we understand what that means for us -- the unencumbered ability to plan and execute attacks against our country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Pakistan, we have seen over the course of the past several years a renewed effort by the Pakistanis to address the threat that not just impacts us but impacts their existence, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, in many ways the upcoming elections are a referendum on the way the war has been conducted.\xc2\xa0 Are you comfortable that the majority of the American people support the sacrifices made for Pakistan and Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that the American people understand very much what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake and what -- the important mission that we have over there.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are political viewpoints that vary across the spectrum.\xc2\xa0 The President, though, understands that -- understands what we must do in addressing the threat to those countries and to us.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what -- that\'s why he made the decision to send more troops to Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we have increased our cooperation with the Pakistanis in order to make progress against those that seek to do us both harm.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the Middle East, in the last few days there\xe2\x80\x99s been a frenzy of diplomatic activity by Senator Mitchell.\xc2\xa0 At what stage do you think the President will be involved personally to save the talks from collapsing, and whether any guarantees has been given to either side?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, former Senator Mitchell and Secretary of State Clinton are very involved on this on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re the President\xe2\x80\x99s representatives.\xc2\xa0 They are working actively with both sides on a way forward.\xc2\xa0 I would quote to you what former Senator Mitchell said this weekend -- that despite the differences, both the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority asked us to continue these discussions and efforts.\xc2\xa0 They both want to continue those negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So we are working with both parties to try to find the appropriate way forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any guarantees were given by the President to the Israelis or the Palestinians?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have -- I don\'t want to get into what Senator Mitchell -- what diplomatic negotiations might have gone on.\xc2\xa0 But I know that they are actively working each and every moment of the day to try to find a way forward on direct talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It looks like the defense authorization bill and, with it, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d repeal is sort of barreling toward a dead end.\xc2\xa0 Sixty-nine House members and now 16 senators have signed on to a letter urging the President to instruct his Justice Department not to appeal a recent decision that ruled \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d unconstitutional.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that\'s even being discussed within the walls of the White House right now, not appealing that decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you over to the -- I think the Department of Justice, the last I heard, was reviewing the case. Obviously the President has a deeply held view that this is a law that can and should be changed.\xc2\xa0 We worked to make sure that that happened in the House, and we, regrettably, were unsuccessful in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 That is not going to stop the President from trying. And I know that -- without being totally aware of all the discussions in here, I know the Justice Department is weighing a series of arguments as they make those decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but ultimately that power resides with the President.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he can instruct is Justice Department not to appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I\'ll be honest with you, I don\'t have an update on whether that\'s something that\'s happened in here or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any contingency plans at all?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve listened to you talk about the priorities for lame duck.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve rattled through them on Thursday, Friday and today, and not once has defense authorization been mentioned.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say, and I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said on a couple of occasions, that off the top of my head -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily say which list is completely exhausted.\xc2\xa0 But let me see if I can get better guidance on that -- understanding, again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s deeply held belief that we have to get this changed.</p>\n<p>\n\tSam, and then I\'ll go.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was just curious, from your perspective, what are the most notable and immediate differences with a new chief of staff these first couple of days?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I thought it would feel or look a lot different.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think know why I thought that.\xc2\xa0 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t, honestly.\xc2\xa0 We were -- look, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same -- it\xe2\x80\x99s in many ways the same group of people, minus Rahm, meeting in the same room at the same time, to discuss the issues that we had on Friday when he was here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, obviously, again, as I said, Pete has got some stylistic differences, obviously, from Rahm, but Pete was also involved in every one of those meetings, every one of those discussions.\xc2\xa0 We continue to be very focused on many of the things that we had in front of us on Friday when Rahm was chief of staff and are continuing to do so with Pete, though we -- I will say I can\xe2\x80\x99t stay awake that late so I watched \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live\xe2\x80\x9d today and -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it accurate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wow, that was -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to its accuracy.\xc2\xa0 It was quite entertaining.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Pete see it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR.
