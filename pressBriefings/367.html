Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t1:05 P.M. EST</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Very festive mood in the briefing room today. \xc2\xa0I\'m sure it\'s just a coincidence. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tLet me do a couple of announcements at the top and then we\'ll go to your questions. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe President is looking forward this afternoon to visiting the National Institutes of Health, where he will meet with some of the men and women on the frontlines of the fight against Ebola. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIn addition to the news you heard yesterday -- I\'m sorry -- that you heard last week about the promising results of NIH\xe2\x80\x99s Ebola vaccine candidate, this morning you saw tangible evidence of just how far we\'ve come in our domestic and international Ebola response over the past few months. \xc2\xa0The administration announced today that we now have 35 medical facilities nationwide prepared to treat an Ebola patient. \xc2\xa0This is up from three just a couple of months ago. \xc2\xa0We\'ve similarly increased the number of domestic labs capable of testing for Ebola from 13 up to 42, just as we\'ve introduced new and enhanced screening and monitoring measures to further protect Americans here at home.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tOf course, Americans won\'t be completely safe until we have ended the outbreak in West Africa, which is why we have also focused on stamping out this disease at its source. \xc2\xa0We now have some 3,000 American civilian and military personnel on the ground in West Africa, up from several hundred a few months ago. \xc2\xa0These brave men and women have been responsible for constructing Ebola treatment units, building a hospital for infected medical workers, training hundreds of health care workers to serve on the frontlines, and countless other response functions.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIn addition, American leadership has helped to galvanize more than $2 billion in contributions from the international community. \xc2\xa0And in Liberia, where our response has been concentrated, we have seen promising results in the form of declining infection rates, indicating that our strategy is working. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd that is precisely why you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President make the case today for Congress to swiftly fund the emergency request that the administration submitted last month. \xc2\xa0Virtually every initiative underway requires immediate additional funding to be continued or advanced. \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s request would provide critical resources to build out our domestic facilities, take the next steps on Ebola vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics, fund our vital Ebola response in West Africa, and strengthen global health security to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to the spread of Ebola in any other vulnerable countries, and to combat similar infectious disease threats.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo that is what you have to look forward to today. \xc2\xa0I have one other scheduling update, which is that on Friday, the President will meet with newly elected governors from across the country here at the White House to discuss the ways in which the administration can partner with states to promote economic opportunity for middle-class Americans. \xc2\xa0The President and the incoming governors will discuss how we can build on our growing economy by creating more jobs and ensuring that every American who works hard has an opportunity to succeed.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI understand that the Vice President will be participating in that meeting as well. \xc2\xa0The governors who participate, we\'re talking about the incoming governor of Alaska, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Texas. \xc2\xa0So that will be Friday afternoon. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just those?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Just those governors, that\'s correct.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What about Arkansas?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Arkansas is not on the list that I have here, but if Governor-elect Hutchinson is able to make the trip we\xe2\x80\x99d certainly find a seat for him at the table. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNedra, do you want to get us started with questions?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, please. \xc2\xa0Has the President settled on Ash Carter as the Defense Secretary nominee?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I anticipated that -- (laughter) -- you or one of your colleagues might ask me about this. \xc2\xa0What I can tell you is not much. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any personnel announcements to make today. \xc2\xa0But as soon as we\'re in a position to start making those announcements we\'ll be sure to let you know. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMr. Carter is obviously somebody who has generated a lot of headlines today. \xc2\xa0He is somebody who has previously served the administration as the Deputy Secretary of Defense, a position that he filled very ably. \xc2\xa0He was confirmed by the United States Senate into that position in September of 2011 by unanimous consent. \xc2\xa0So this is an indication that he fulfills some of the criteria that we\'ve discussed in the past. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s somebody that certainly deserves and has demonstrated strong bipartisan support for his previous service in government. \xc2\xa0He is somebody that does have a detailed understanding of the way that the Department of Defense works.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd I personally am a pretty strong advocate of people who have previously performed well in deputy roles being promoted to the top job. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0That\'s been a recipe for success in filling previous personnel positions. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut that said, I don\'t have an update at all on the process. \xc2\xa0I think it\'s for all these reasons that it\'s been widely reported that Mr. Carter has been on the short list. \xc2\xa0But in terms of where things stand in that process, I just don\'t have any additional information to share at this time.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is anyone else on the short list? \xc2\xa0And would you describe him as the leading candidate? \xc2\xa0You seem to have a lot of nice things to say about him.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, he is somebody who did serve -- has served the President and the American people well previously in this administration. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t have any additional insight to share with you about the process or other people involved in the process, or even any additional information about the timing of that process.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But there are reports out there saying that the President has selected him. \xc2\xa0Are those reports inaccurate?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'ve read those reports, but I can\'t comment on them at this point.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Ebola, while the White House today is talking a lot about some of the progress that\'s being made, Doctors Without Borders is out saying that the international response has been slow and uneven. \xc2\xa0And they say the international community has come in and built team management structures, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not providing the hands-on medical care that\'s needed on the ground. Does the President agree that that\'s a valid concern, and does he think the international community needs to do more to provide hands-on medical care?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\'t seen the precise statement that you\'re referring to, but I can say as a general matter that the administration, including the President, does believe that additional efforts are going to be required if we\'re going to stop this outbreak in its tracks in West Africa. \xc2\xa0There are still a lot of people in West Africa who are suffering. \xc2\xa0And as long as people are suffering from the Ebola virus, we know that they are at risk of spreading that disease.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWhile we believe, and continue to believe, that the likelihood of a widespread outbreak in the United States remains exceedingly low, that risk is not zero until we have stopped this disease in its tracks in West Africa. \xc2\xa0And that is why you\'re going to hear the President pretty forcefully advocate for additional resources that can advance the efforts that we\'ve already undertaken to try to stamp out this disease in West Africa.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSteve.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, one of the ideas circulating up on the Hill is to pass a spending bill through September that leaves DHS at current levels as a way of getting at the immigration orders. \xc2\xa0Would the President sign legislation like this?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Steve, you\'re right, that is one of many ideas circulating on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0I know that\'s something that Republicans have been talking about in a meeting that they convened on the House side earlier today. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have a specific reaction to that proposal other than to say that the administration believes that it\'s the responsibility of Congress to pass a full-year budget for the federal government. \xc2\xa0And that is what we would like to see them do.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99d like to see them pass that full-year budget for the full government. \xc2\xa0That\'s not -- as I think I said yesterday, we\'re not asking them to do anything heroic. \xc2\xa0We\'re asking them to do their job. \xc2\xa0And that is a responsibility that has been given to the United States Congress by the founders of this country and we believe it\'s important for the Congress to fulfill that responsibility for a variety of reasons, including that Republicans themselves have observed that adding some consistency and some certainty to this process is good for the economy. \xc2\xa0It\'s good for people who are trying to make business decisions that they know that they don\'t have to worry about a shutdown of the government or a partial shutdown of the government. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we\'re hopeful that Republicans will follow their own advice in that regard and pass a full-year budget for the full federal government.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you seeing the warning signs of another government shutdown looming in the next few weeks?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there are people who probably do a better job of reading the tea leaves, so to speak, of the Republican conference than I. \xc2\xa0But Senator McConnell, as I mentioned yesterday, was pretty declarative shortly after the election that there wouldn\'t be a shutdown. \xc2\xa0He obviously is somebody who is going to have pretty significant say over how this process works. \xc2\xa0So we certainly take some heart in Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s comments. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe also take some heart in the view that\'s been expressed by people in both parties that a government shutdown is not good for the American economy and a government shutdown, at least in the fall of 2013, was not good for the political prospects of Republicans. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think that\'s everybody\xe2\x80\x99s view, but I think that is -- I feel confident in saying that\'s the majority view, at least of the majority of Republicans here in Washington. \xc2\xa0So I hope that that prevailing view will carry the day this time, too.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMichelle.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hearing some of the testimony today for the House Homeland Security Committee that seemed to not bode well for Congress wanting to fund the immigration measure. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know if you read any of that testimony, but it seemed to be some -- at least a strong feeling as we\'ve heard in some of the rhetoric prior.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I did not have a chance to watch that testimony firsthand. \xc2\xa0I did read some of the coverage of it this morning. \xc2\xa0I was not particularly surprised that people who we\xe2\x80\x99re critical of the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement a couple of weeks ago reiterated that criticism in the context of Secretary Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s hearing today. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut the fact is Republicans have long adopted the view that is contrary to the view of the vast majority of Americans that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t reform our broken immigration system. \xc2\xa0They think that\'s a bad idea. \xc2\xa0The President happens to disagree, and that\'s why the President acted on his own within the confines of his authority to try to reform as much of the broken immigration system as he possibly could. \xc2\xa0That\'s the nature of the step that the President took about 10 days ago; that\'s what Secretary Johnson discussed on Capitol Hill today. \xc2\xa0And I\'m not particularly surprised that there were some House Republicans who were critical of that effort. \xc2\xa0But, again, those House Republicans who had pretty negative things to say have a view of immigration reform that stands in stark contrast with the view that has been articulated by the President, the view that\'s been articulated by Senate Democrats, the view that\'s been articulated by some Senate Republicans, the view that\'s been articulated by business leaders all across the country, the view that\'s been articulated by law enforcement officials all across the country, the view that\'s been articulated by the Catholic bishops and leaders of the evangelical faith community in this country.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo the harsh words from House Republicans today may have earned them some ink and maybe even some coverage on cable television today, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that they, because of their views on this issue, remain pretty isolated from the American public.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0For two days now we\'ve heard you really kind of stridently push for the funding for Ebola. \xc2\xa0Does the administration feel like there\xe2\x80\x99s any confidence in getting that? It just seems like you feel the need to really stress that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0As I described a little bit yesterday, I think we have seen a recognition on the part of Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill that providing the necessary resources to deal with the Ebola outbreak and to ensure that we have a high level of readiness here in this country is a legitimate national priority. \xc2\xa0And we certainly are pleased that that seems to be a bipartisan view. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAt the same time, even when it comes to issues like immigration reform, we\'ve seen other things that people on both sides of the aisle have identified as a legitimate national priority that haven\'t made progress in the Congress. \xc2\xa0So this is an effort to make sure that we are continuing to remind people across the country and Democrats and Republicans in Congress that fully funding these programs that are improving our readiness here in this country and stamping out this Ebola outbreak in West Africa have the resources necessary to succeed. \xc2\xa0It\'s clearly in the best interest of the country and clearly in the best interest of the American people.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it seems like you feel like there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance that that won\'t happen. \xc2\xa0Do you feel like --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There is a chance that won\'t happen. \xc2\xa0It would be a shame if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, particularly because we have seen expressions of support from Democrats and Republicans about how and why this should be a priority. \xc2\xa0So we\'re going to continue to work this, and obviously the President is going to spend some time talking about this at the National Institutes of Health later today.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And lastly, on Ferguson. \xc2\xa0Yesterday, when we did finally get the list of everybody in attendance, I noticed that there weren\'t any members of the Ferguson Police Department among the law enforcement. \xc2\xa0Any particular reason for that, why you wouldn\'t have included that department in particular?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President was interested in gathering stakeholders from across the country, not just one community. \xc2\xa0So I can\'t account for sort of who was not a participant in the meeting, but I can tell you those who did participate in the meeting I do think felt like it was a really important discussion, and even debate, in some instances, to have about the importance of building bridges and restoring some trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities that they\xe2\x80\x99re sworn to serve and protect.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The administration didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it was necessary to put somebody from that police department on there?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, that this is the kind of discussion that is taking place not just in Ferguson, but in communities all across the country. \xc2\xa0And I think the President was able to tap into that broader national sentiment in the context of this meeting even though it didn\xe2\x80\x99t include law enforcement officials from Ferguson, Missouri.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tCheryl.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0There are a couple of different tax extender proposals on the Hill right now --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At least a couple.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0At least a couple. \xc2\xa0The House is set to vote on a one-year package. \xc2\xa0The Senate Democrats are looking at a two-year package. \xc2\xa0Where is the White House on this? \xc2\xa0Would you support a shorter term, and do you have a preference?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we have been in close touch with Democrats and Republicans in both the House and the Senate to discuss some of these issues. \xc2\xa0Obviously last week we made it known to all of you and to all of them that the President took a pretty dim view of proposals that would shower significant tax benefits on well-connected corporations without providing much relief to working people in this country. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe President thinks that an approach like that is both unfair and bad economic policy. \xc2\xa0The President believes that the way that we can really strengthen our economy is to make sure that our economy is growing from the middle out, and we do that by investing in middle-class families and those who are trying to get into the middle class. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why we should be focused on policies that do exactly that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNow, there are some policies that would benefit big businesses but in a way that would actually allow those businesses to create jobs and expand economic growth and opportunity in a way that would be good for middle-class families. \xc2\xa0So I\'m not suggesting that there aren\'t some things that we can do that would be beneficial to some businesses in this country, but we need to make sure that we\'re really focused on the interests and concerns of middle-class families. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s most important both, again, because it\'s the most fair way for us to run the business of the American government; it also is the best way for us to strengthen the economy.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So would you veto a one-year package if that\'s what the House --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring my -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t walk out here today planning to issue any veto threats, so I don\'t think I\'m going to. \xc2\xa0But we\'ll see what happens over the course of the rest of the briefing. \xc2\xa0I\'m certainly not going to in response to your question. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe are going to evaluate the proposals that are being discussed on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0We\'re going to continue to participate in those discussions and we\'re hopeful that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to come up with something that we believe is good for middle-class families. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tDoug. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you today.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks very much. \xc2\xa0Wendell is downstairs hacking up his lungs.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I see. \xc2\xa0Thank you for sparing us all. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You would not appreciate it. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I hope Wendell gets well soon, though. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The House is expected to vote as early as next week on overturning the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive action on immigration. \xc2\xa0If the Senate acts similarly, will the President veto?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we have indicated that the President would strongly oppose any sort of legislative effort to undo the executive action that he announced about 10 days ago. \xc2\xa0The actions that the President is taking are well within the confines of the law and within the authority that he\xe2\x80\x99s been given by the United States Constitution. \xc2\xa0They also are clearly in the best interest of the American people. \xc2\xa0We need to restore some accountability to our immigration system, and that\'s exactly what the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive proposals would do. \xc2\xa0It would streamline our legal immigration system. \xc2\xa0It would also do a lot to bring millions of people who are already in this country out of the shadows, make them pay taxes, make them get right with the law. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd the fact is the closest thing we have to amnesty in this country is doing nothing, and that\'s exactly what House Republicans seem to be advocating. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Another subject, different question. \xc2\xa0As you know, this public interest group, this watchdog group, Cause of Action, sued the IRS last September, seeking all documents from the IRS, taxpayer information that may have been shared with the White House or with the executive branch. \xc2\xa0A federal judge last September ordered the IRS to turn over those documents by a deadline of yesterday, December 1st. \xc2\xa0Instead of turning over the documents, TIGTA sent a letter to this group, Cause of Action, saying in effect that they were not going to turn them over, they were going to withhold them because they\xe2\x80\x99re privileged taxpayer information. \xc2\xa0And the letter to Cause of Action read in part: \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAll 2,043 pages of documents we have determined to be responsive were collected by the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to the determination of possible liability under Title 26 of the U.S. Code. \xc2\xa0These pages consist of return information protected by the U.S. Code. \xc2\xa0Because no such exceptions exist here, we\'re withholding them.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tHas the United States -- has the White House been given privileged taxpayer information by the IRS that should not have been shared?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Doug, I can tell you that I am not familiar with the specific case that you\'re raising here. \xc2\xa0And that\'s not surprising to me. \xc2\xa0There obviously is some distance between the White House and the IRS because it\'s an independent organization that\'s responsible for collecting taxes, and it conducts that business outside the realm of any sort of political interference. \xc2\xa0And those are rules that we\'ve adhered to pretty closely. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYou\'re also citing a letter that was written by TIGTA, which is the inspector general, who also is somebody who acts independent of the administration. \xc2\xa0So I\'d refer --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- saying in the letter that the office of the Secretary of the Treasury prevented them from turning over the documents. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'d refer you to the Treasury Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s office for the explanation for why that may or may not be the case. \xc2\xa0I\'m just not familiar with the specifics.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\'re saying as a rule, the White House has never been offered privileged taxpayer --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I can tell you that as a rule that the Obama administration has been very rigorous in following all of the rules and regulations that govern proper communication between Treasury officials and White House officials and the Internal Revenue Service.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tJon.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I want to ask about something else that happened today in the Senate. \xc2\xa0You had some of your ambassadors confirmed after a long process. \xc2\xa0One of those, Colleen Bell, confirmed as ambassador to Hungary. \xc2\xa0If you can remind me, what are Colleen Bell\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications for ambassador? \xc2\xa0Is it that she was a soap opera producer? \xc2\xa0Is it that she gave hundreds of thousands of dollars or helped to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Obama reelection campaign? \xc2\xa0Why was she chosen?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jon, I can tell you first that you\'re right, that the confirmation of these individuals to these important ambassadorial posts is long overdue and we certainly are pleased that the Senate has finally acted on them. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAs it relates to Ambassador Bell, she is somebody who retains the confidence -- well, let me say it this way. \xc2\xa0Ambassador Bell has the President\xe2\x80\x99s confidence that she will do an excellent job representing the United States and maintaining the important relationship that the United States has with the government and the people of Hungary.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But where does the President get that confidence? \xc2\xa0I mean, in her confirmation hearing, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even name a single strategic interest the United States had with Hungary.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, she certainly is somebody, again, that has had her own distinguished private sector career.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As a soap opera producer.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, and as somebody who obviously has succeeded in the business world. \xc2\xa0And she is somebody that the President has confidence will be able to maintain our relationship with the government and the people of Hungary.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you tell me that the fact that she helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for the President\xe2\x80\x99s reelection campaign had nothing to do with her appointment? \xc2\xa0You can\xe2\x80\x99t say that, can you?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I can tell you that that\xe2\x80\x99s not the reason that she was chosen. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that the reason that she was chosen --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- a factor in the decision?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Frankly, I was not part of this decision-making process, but I can tell you that the reason that she was chosen is because the President has complete confidence in her ability to represent the United States in that country.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what does the President think overall of this practice? \xc2\xa0Obviously it didn\xe2\x80\x99t start with him. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a long history of this -- of big donors to political campaigns getting rewards with plum ambassadorial posts. \xc2\xa0I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this the kind of practice that when he first came to Washington he came to do away with?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, all I can say, Jon, as a general matter is that these ambassadors who are representing our country overseas have very important responsibilities. \xc2\xa0And these are responsibilities that the President, nobody here at the White House takes lightly. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that these individuals who have been recently confirmed to their post certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t take those responsibilities lightly either. \xc2\xa0And we certainly are looking forward to Ambassador Bell being a -- moving to Hungary and getting down to the important work that she has in front of her.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0J.C.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Clearly the President\xe2\x80\x99s long-term professional relationship, including Senate colleague, with Secretary of Defense Hagel was an important factor in his appointing him as Secretary of Defense. \xc2\xa0Will this criteria still hold with the President in terms of the next -- whoever the next Secretary of Defense nominee will be -- in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, the working knowledge of this individual and their long-term relationship, and his confidence in the individual?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, J.C., certainly having a personal relationship with the President like Secretary Hagel does is beneficial to him in the role that he has had for the last two years. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s been a part of a lot of very important decisions and he\xe2\x80\x99s had to give some unvarnished advice to the President in some very difficult situations. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd having a personal relationship like that is helpful, but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not a requirement, and there are a number of other individuals who have important positions in this government that did not have a previous personal relationship with the President -- they didn\xe2\x80\x99t serve with him in the Senate, for example. \xc2\xa0So that is an indication that it certainly is a benefit but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a requirement. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jon.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, a couple Hill things. \xc2\xa0One on the Defense Secretary appointment -- I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not ready to say who it is, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep guessing. \xc2\xa0But I do want to know -- there have been a lot of complaints from Secretary Panetta, from Secretary Gates, and maybe someday from the next secretary -- also from Secretary Hagel -- about the control from the White House. \xc2\xa0Can the next nominee expect less micromanagement as previous Defense Secretaries have felt?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jon, I do think that looking back -- I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not a scholar in this area but I do believe that if you sort of look back at previous administrations that there\xe2\x80\x99s always some natural tension that exists between the Pentagon and the White House. \xc2\xa0The President is, after all, the Commander-in-Chief, so he obviously has a significant say over what kinds of things are happening over at the Department of Defense.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That said, I think the President has been proud of the service of the three previous -- or the three gentlemen who have served as the Secretary of Defense in this administration because they have fulfilled a very important responsibility in terms of running a large agency that has a significant impact on the core mission of keeping the American people safe. \xc2\xa0So the President is pleased with their work and the President has been proud of their leadership, but I think the kind of tension that you\xe2\x80\x99re describing is not at all unique to this administration.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And Senator McCain has said since we got in here today that he is favorably inclined toward Ash Carter -- didn\xe2\x80\x99t say he\xe2\x80\x99d vote for him. \xc2\xa0How does that affect the nomination or the possibility of the nomination?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say as a general matter, when Mr. Carter was nominated to be the Deputy Secretary of Defense, he was confirmed with unanimous consent, which means that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a single member of the United States Senate who stood up to object to his nomination so I think that is an indication that he is somebody who has succeeded in the past of winning strong bipartisan support for his leadership and government service, and that certainly is part of the criteria for whoever the next Secretary of Defense will be, but having previously served in government is not a requirement for this job.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And if I can piggyback on Cheryl. \xc2\xa0She asked if he would veto a one-year tax extender package. \xc2\xa0I want to ask the opposite way. \xc2\xa0Would the President sign a short-term extender package that has less of these business extensions in it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jon, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with members of Congress to examine what\xe2\x80\x99s exactly included in these proposals. \xc2\xa0So in the same way I didn\xe2\x80\x99t promise to veto anything when Cheryl asked, I\xe2\x80\x99m not promising to veto anything when you\xe2\x80\x99re asking either. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly continue to consult as a part of that process and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what comes out.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Major.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, just following that line of questioning. \xc2\xa0Last week, you were able to articulate objections you had to what was emerging. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a House bill that\xe2\x80\x99s on the website. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s going to go to rules. \xc2\xa0Do you have objections to that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the reason that we were able to express such a clear point of view rather strenuously is that it was the emerging outlines of that deal as it was being reported so clearly violated what the President believes is a core principle of his economic philosophy.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this week would clearly violate it in the same way?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not necessarily. \xc2\xa0Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge the outcome here because this is legislation that, yes, has been posted but it was only posted last night and it\xe2\x80\x99s still being reviewed. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, I understand. \xc2\xa0Last week it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even posted and you were objecting to it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Right, again, because it was so clearly objectionable and so clearly a contradiction of this core economic --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m just trying to find where you guys are.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Right, and what I can tell you is that I guess maybe you could interpret that because we\xe2\x80\x99re not right out of the box forcefully promising to veto it. \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t have as bad a view of it as we did this deal that was being discussed on Capitol Hill last week. \xc2\xa0The reason I think for that involves a couple of things. \xc2\xa0One is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant difference between taking one element of a tax code and extending it for one year, and making it permanent. \xc2\xa0And that certainly is a significant factor as we evaluate the proposals that are being generated by both the House and the Senate. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to consult with that process and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see where we\xe2\x80\x99re at.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- favorably inclined?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would go that far. \xc2\xa0I think still reviewing is where I\xe2\x80\x99d put it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the process of choosing a Defense Secretary complete?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Major, there is a lot of interest in this position, as there should be. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking names. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying is the process complete?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of interest in the process, too.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As you constantly remind us, that that is a prerequisite to the ceremonial announcement and presentation. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to find out --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve been right every time that I said that. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If you can tell us if the process itself is complete.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on the process. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to give --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, I know.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You can\xe2\x80\x99t say one way or the other?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say about the process itself. \xc2\xa0When the President -- I guess the one thing I can say about the process is this: \xc2\xa0When the President is ready to announce a decision, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that all of you are there to hear it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has he reached a decision?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the process that I\xe2\x80\x99m just not ready to talk about.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Fair enough. \xc2\xa0Is the Ebola funding issue of sufficient significance that if it\xe2\x80\x99s not included to the satisfaction of the President, that could jeopardize the entire omnibus being drafted for the remaining one year of the budget cycle?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. \xc2\xa0I will say -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll describe it this way. \xc2\xa0Ensuring that we have the necessary resources to meet this important criteria, again, to ensure that we have the proper level of readiness here domestically and that we\xe2\x80\x99re dedicating the necessary resources in West Africa to actually stamp out this outbreak is a top national security priority. \xc2\xa0The President has articulated that previously, that continues to be a top national security priority today, even if it is getting a little less media attention than it has over the last several months.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to issue a veto threat, but I am prepared to say that as the omnibus works its way through the process, we certainly have been in close touch with members of Congress to make sure that they understand that these resources for combatting Ebola should be included in the omnibus, obviously, and will be something -- will be an element of the omnibus package that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be paying very close attention to.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hoping you had a productive conversation with Katie before the briefing on the NDAA. \xc2\xa0The House has made it clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to bring that forward later on this week, looking, hoping that it will be not amended in the Senate. \xc2\xa0Is that something you\xe2\x80\x99re inclined to support as drafted?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I did have the opportunity to talk to Ms. Fallon and a couple members of her staff about this issue this morning. \xc2\xa0There are a couple things I can say about it. \xc2\xa0This is something that administration officials have been working on for quite some time with their counterparts in Congress, both in the House and the Senate, with Democrats and Republicans. \xc2\xa0This has been a genuine bipartisan process. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the way that this process has worked in the past and we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to see that that\xe2\x80\x99s the way that it appears to be working again this year.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The nature of these kinds of bipartisan efforts, however, though, is that the legislation is essentially a compromise, which means that neither side gets everything that they want. \xc2\xa0And certainly in this instance we do not anticipate that the administration is going to be able to get everything that we would like to see included in this package. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As of this morning -- at least mid-morning, the details of this legislation had not been posted yet and we have not seen them -- the final details. \xc2\xa0We do have some insight about what might be there but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you encouraged by the direction?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0I mean, there -- let me actually just go one step farther to say that there are a couple things that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at that we anticipate will be positive, and a couple of things that we anticipate either won\xe2\x80\x99t be in there or will be in there in a way that we find disappointing. \xc2\xa0When it comes to the positives, we do anticipate -- and we spent a lot of time this summer talking about ensuring that the Department of Defense had Title X authority, that they needed to train and equip Syrian opposition fighters. \xc2\xa0That is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working closely with Congress to be sure is included in this specific proposal. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve also been working with members of Congress to ensure that some of the reforms to fight sexual assault in the military is also included in this proposal. \xc2\xa0I believe some progress has been made in that regard as well, and we certainly would welcome that progress. \xc2\xa0There are a couple of things in there that we are concerned about. \xc2\xa0The first is, as has been the case for the last several years, we do anticipate that there will be additional language in this legislation that will limit the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0That is something that we have been, frankly, pretty critical of in the past. \xc2\xa0If it\xe2\x80\x99s included in there again, it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be critical of again because, again, the President believes that --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Not sufficiently so to veto it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to evaluate the whole package. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But in the past, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, in the past we have gone ahead and signed legislation that included this language, even though we\xe2\x80\x99ve registered our objections with this language at each turn. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The one last thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ll say about this is the other thing that we have strongly advocated is the inclusion of some badly needed budgetary reforms at the Pentagon. \xc2\xa0These budget reforms have been strongly supported by both the civilian and military leadership of the Pentagon. \xc2\xa0And they have made the case that these budget reforms are necessary because it has a critical impact on the ability of our men and women in uniform to do their jobs safely and to keep the American people safe. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So we have advocated for the inclusion of these reforms. \xc2\xa0We have reason to believe that these -- that we may not have gotten nearly as many of these reforms as the administration would have liked. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll review and see what\xe2\x80\x99s in there. \xc2\xa0I understand that they\xe2\x80\x99re still making some tweaks to this legislation even as of this morning so there is a chance that maybe some of these concerns could be resolved. \xc2\xa0But somebody did -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember who it was -- Jon, I guess maybe it was you who asked about sort of this concern that previous Secretaries of Defense have registered about the administration micromanaging the activities of the Pentagon. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe fact is, you have civilian and military leaders at the Pentagon asking Congress for very specific budgetary reforms that will strengthen national security, but time and time again we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen members of Congress refuse to go along with them. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it gets -- if you could do more to micromanage the Pentagon than to refuse to include the budgetary reforms that our civilian and military leadership believe are critically important to the military being able to do their job.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s more micromanaging from Congress than you exercise here at the White House?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the eventual inclusion is in this legislation but certainly if we believe just as a principle that we should give greater freedom of decision-making to military and civilian leaders at the Pentagon, then I would assume we would see strong bipartisan support for some of the budget reforms that those military and civilian leaders say are so important.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One last thing. \xc2\xa0Tuesday, when the President was getting some blowback from the audience in Chicago during his immigration remarks, at one point he said, I just took action to change the law. \xc2\xa0Did the President misspeak in a moment of sort of passion to try to calm the crowd, or does he fundamentally -- do you fundamentally believe that he has taken action to change the law?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think he was speaking colloquially, that what he has put in place --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Meaning?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Meaning that obviously --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, no, meaning that it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the United States Congress to pass laws and it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the executive branch to implement and enforce them. \xc2\xa0So I guess my point is --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- mean by that when he says I just took action to change the law?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the impact of the law certainly has been changed in terms of the way that it affects millions of people who are in this country, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President was alluding to. \xc2\xa0So if there are people who --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He did not literally mean he changed the law?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think that he was speaking colloquially there -- say that five times fast. \xc2\xa0Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop saying it. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Carrie, how are you?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hi. \xc2\xa0Good. \xc2\xa0How are you?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m doing great, thank you. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jeh Johnson this morning spoke up pretty forcefully against the short-term CR for his department, describing how it really tied his hands. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House holds similarly strong views and does that rise to the level of it being enough to not accept that -- vetoing the whole package because of those concerns that DHS is saying it will have a detrimental effect on Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, certainly this is one of the benefits of Cabinet Secretaries testifying before Congress, is they can make sure the members of Congress are acutely aware of the concerns they may have about steps that Congress may be considering. \xc2\xa0But again, there are a wide variety of proposals that are being bandied about by Democrats and Republicans on the Hill. \xc2\xa0I know that this is a proposal that many House Republicans are pretty focused on today. \xc2\xa0So it is our view that Congress should fulfill their responsibility to pass a full-year budget for the full federal government. \xc2\xa0I know there are some proposals that are being considered that would stop short of that, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll consider those proposals if and when they are passed by either the House or Senate, or both. \xc2\xa0But we believe that it\'s important for Congress to fulfill their responsibility to pass a full-year budget for the full federal government.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling it in or ruling it out at this point? Because it\'s not yet clear.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess because for two reasons -- one, is because, yes, the details of the proposal that House Republicans are focused on are not entirely clear at this point. They haven\xe2\x80\x99t put something forward. \xc2\xa0But also because that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s being discussed on Capitol Hill for making sure that we fund the government by December 11th. \xc2\xa0So for those two reasons, I\xe2\x80\x99ll reserve judgment, beyond saying that we do believe that Congress has responsibility to pass a full-year budget for the full federal government.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tApril.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, two subjects, one on Ebola. \xc2\xa0Since we have not seen any Ebola cases in this country for a while, any new cases, is this country still not out of the woods, as the President said recently, when it comes to Ebola?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Is the country still not what?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Still not out of the woods. \xc2\xa0Remember the President said a couple weeks ago in the Roosevelt Room that we are not out of the woods. \xc2\xa0Are we still not out of the woods yet?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what the President may have been talking about is a number of people who were on the contact tracing lists of a couple of previous Ebola patients. \xc2\xa0So I think he was referring to that specific incident. \xc2\xa0As a general matter I can say that the President does continue to believe that the likelihood of a widespread outbreak in the United States remains exceedingly low, but the President and his administration continue to be vigilant to make sure that we are at an appropriate level of readiness in this country to deal with an Ebola patient if one should present himself or herself at a medical facility in this country. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re watching that very carefully.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There obviously are very tight monitoring protocols in place to ensure that individuals who have recently traveled in West Africa and are entering this country are being properly screened both as they enter the country but also for a number of days after they have arrived. \xc2\xa0Those protocols are in place, are being closely administered -- carefully administered. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd the President continues to believe that the risk to the American public is not entirely eliminated until we\xe2\x80\x99ve entirely eliminated the Ebola virus from West Africa. \xc2\xa0And we are still seeing -- despite the progress that has been made, there\xe2\x80\x99s still too many communities in Africa that are fighting this deadly disease. \xc2\xa0And the President wants to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re devoting the necessary resources from the United States to combat this outbreak and to try to stop it in its tracks, but were also going to continue to urge the international community to step up and fulfill the responsibility that they have to fight this outbreak as well.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Again, as long as this outbreak is still underway in West Africa it poses a risk to citizens of countries around the globe, and we\xe2\x80\x99d like to continue to see governments and organizations and citizens from countries around the globe assist in the response of this effort.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And my last question, I want to tackle a question that I needed an answer for yesterday and will come at it a different way. \xc2\xa0Reverend Al Sharpton said, as it relates to President Obama going to Ferguson -- he told me on the phone last night, he says an invite -- if the President were to go to Ferguson, an invite would need to come from the family and come from the community leaders there. \xc2\xa0Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for, for the President to go to Ferguson?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, it\'s not. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What are you waiting for?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, the President wants to have a national discussion because there are communities all across the nation who are grappling with some of these issues, who are grappling with the challenge of having effective law enforcement that also has the trust of the community that their sworn to serve and protect. \xc2\xa0That is difficult work. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWhat we do know -- the good news is what we do know is that the more trust that a law enforcement agency has from the community the more effective that law enforcement agency can be in fighting crime. \xc2\xa0So building those kinds of relationships and facilitating that kind of transparency and accountability is critically important to the basis work of law enforcement. \xc2\xa0Our men and women in law enforcement have very difficult jobs. \xc2\xa0These are individuals who walk out the door every morning, kiss their kids goodbye and go to work, knowing that they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice to put their life on the line to protect the community. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s honorable work. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s work that is worthy of our respect and appreciation. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut we also know that those individuals are going to be more effective in their job if they do have the trust in the community that their serving. \xc2\xa0So this is a complicated issue. \xc2\xa0This is one that communities across this country have been dealing with for decades. \xc2\xa0So it\'s not something that were going to solve over the course of a few weeks, or not one that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to solve in the context of one specific trip, but rather something that were going to address through a sustained effort and a sustained dialogue. \xc2\xa0You heard from the President directly himself yesterday indicate his desire to lead that effort.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When you talk about trust and solutions, are you looking at something that could be a short-term solution, a major short-term solution that could really shake up the system or the structure -- the systemic structure that has been there for so long? \xc2\xa0Maybe January, February, or after Holder leaves, or before Holder leaves -- you keep talking about trust and solutions. \xc2\xa0What could that be and what could that bring?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there is one solution that\xe2\x80\x99s going to work for every community across the country. \xc2\xa0I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need, is were going to need to see a commitment from local leaders and local law enforcement stepping up to the plate and deciding what reforms are going to work best for their agency and work best in their community to try to build this bond of trust that we believe is so critically important to fighting crime. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd this was the nature of the conversation that the President had with law enforcement and civil rights leaders and state and local elected officials over in the EEOB just yesterday. \xc2\xa0This is difficult work. \xc2\xa0And there are several ways in which the federal government can support those efforts at the local level, whether it\'s additional training, grants for new technology, including body-worn cameras -- there might be other equipment that could be of assistance in this effort. \xc2\xa0There certainly are other resources that can be provided to help implement best practices. \xc2\xa0Things that work well in one community could be transferred and implemented in another community to have a positive effect on the relationship between the law enforcement agency and the community they serve. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo there are a lot of ways that the federal government can be helpful in this effort, and the President is interested in mobilizing resources at the federal level to do exactly that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tJohn.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0On Sunday, Taiwan had very significant elections in which pro-independence candidates routed the ruling Kuomintang Party. \xc2\xa0And the call for independence in Taiwan went up. \xc2\xa0China has long said that independence would mean harsh action from them against Taiwan. \xc2\xa0Is this something the President is following and -- he talks about hot spots so often -- and is the administration still fully committed to the Taiwan Relations Act to protect the Republic of China on Taiwan?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0John, I can tell you that the President has been briefed on the outcome of the elections, but for more details on our policy, let me have one of my colleagues at the National Security Council follow up with you to make sure we get you the right answer to that. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0The other thing I wanted to ask was, Congressman Dan Mica of Florida rereleased a report he did four years ago when Democrats were in charge in the House about government assets being mismanaged by so many different government agencies, the General Services Administration and eight others. \xc2\xa0He recommends selling this to private business to manage some of the government buildings and properties and says he has bipartisan support. \xc2\xa0Is this something the administration would embrace -- the selling of federal assets to the private sector?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know this is something that the Office of Management and Budget has been focused on quite a bit under this President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, that there has been a concerted effort to reduce costs, to cut red tape, and to deal with surplus federal government assets. \xc2\xa0And I know that\xe2\x80\x99s been done to save taxpayers not just hundreds of millions of dollars, but I believe even billions of dollars. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s thanks to the cost-cutting efforts of senior members of the Obama administration.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen Representative Mica\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, but it\'s certainly something we would take a look at. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tChris.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple of quick things. \xc2\xa0First, on Ebola. \xc2\xa0I just wondered, the fact the President has gone out obviously shows some level of concern. \xc2\xa0How concerned is the White House that the money might not come through? \xc2\xa0And can you give us a little sense now, because he\xe2\x80\x99s been quite below the radar, although he\xe2\x80\x99s out there now, on Ron Klain\xe2\x80\x99s role, particularly as it relates to talking to members of Congress? \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I can tell you, as I mentioned to Michelle, the administration does believe that the funding for these Ebola priorities should be taken very seriously by members of Congress. \xc2\xa0There are early indications --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How concerned are you that it might not get done?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there are Democrats and Republicans in Congress who have indicated that they share the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view that these are priorities, that there is a need to redouble our efforts to improve readiness in this country, and a need to redouble our efforts in West Africa to stop that outbreak in its tracks so we can entirely eliminate the Ebola risk to the American people. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThese are worthy efforts; the President has called them a top national security priority. \xc2\xa0I know there are Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill who share that view. \xc2\xa0Now, as I also mentioned, just because Democrats and Republicans believe something is a priority doesn\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee it\'s going to get done in Congress.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this administration continue to forcefully advocate for its passage. \xc2\xa0And we are hopeful, as I mentioned earlier, that it will be included in an omnibus proposal that would pass through the Congress before December 11th. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAs it relates to Mr. Klain, I know that he\xe2\x80\x99s accompanying the President to the National Institutes of Health today and will be participating in those activities while the President\xe2\x80\x99s there. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any specific calls that he himself has had with members of Congress, although I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule it out.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is his role still open-ended?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0In terms of, does he plan to leave? \xc2\xa0Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking? \xc2\xa0Open-ended in terms of time, or open-ended in terms of something else?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Open-ended in terms of time.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I see. \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any plans that are in place for Mr. Klain to leave. \xc2\xa0I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of important work to ensure that we are stamping out this Ebola outbreak that remains to be done. \xc2\xa0And I am pleased to report that Mr. Klain will be here for the foreseeable future to make progress against that goal.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tVictoria, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0Were any U.S. intelligence agencies involved in the reported capture of a wife and son of al-Baghdadi?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have seen those reports about the Lebanese indicating that they had detained an individual who fits that description. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have much that I can share with you about this. \xc2\xa0I certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about any intelligence agency activities from here. \xc2\xa0But I know that the Lebanese government has talked a little bit about what they\xe2\x80\x99ve learned, and so I would refer you to them for that information. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you talk about whether the U.S. has been involved in any interrogation of this woman and the possible son of al-Baghdadi?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to do that, no.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Ebola, has the President reached out to any lawmakers regarding funding?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there are any presidential conversations to share with you. \xc2\xa0I know that there have been\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t-\xe2\x80\x93 well, actually I take that back. \xc2\xa0I know that this is something that they discussed when the President convened that lunch here with the congressional leaders shortly after the election. \xc2\xa0This is one of the things that was on the agenda, because, again, the President does believe that this is an important national security priority and the President urged leaders in both parties to be supportive of efforts to dedicate necessary resources to fighting the Ebola outbreak and to improving readiness here in this country. \xc2\xa0So this is something that the President has discussed with congressional leaders.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was there any thinking that maybe taking the call public might be counterproductive in the sense that there is a sort of naming and shaming element to it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any naming and shaming going on in this instance at least. \xc2\xa0This is a situation where we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of Republicans articulate their support for funding these priorities. \xc2\xa0We certainly would welcome that support, and rather than shame them, we would actually compliment them for focusing on important priorities. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s important work that needs to get done, though, in making sure that the necessary resources are included in this omnibus proposal and that an omnibus proposal gets through the United States Congress before December 11th. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s important work to be done. \xc2\xa0It\'s important for the American people to recognize that work is still on the to-do list, and we hope that Congress will confront that quickly.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThanks a lot, everybody. \xc2\xa0Have a good afternoon.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t1:57 P.M.
