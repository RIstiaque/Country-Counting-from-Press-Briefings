Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>11:44 A.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good Monday morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements at the top of this briefing, so I will go straight to the Associated Press.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President will be heading up to New York for the U.N. General Assembly meetings.\xc2\xa0 How does he intend to frame the U.S. response to some of the hot spots in the world right now, whether it be Syria, the unrest in the Middle East, the issue with the potential concern of Israel confronting Iran? What does he hope to accomplish in his speech?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 The United Nations General Assembly always provides an opportunity for the President to put the international situation in context and to put forward a vision of U.S. leadership, and that\'s what he will do tomorrow.</p>\n<p>I would expect the President to address the recent unrest in the Muslim world and the broader context of the democratic transitions in the Arab world.\xc2\xa0 As he has in recent days, the President will make it clear that we reject the views in the video that has caused offense in the Muslim world, while also underscoring that violence is never acceptable -- a message that has been echoed by the leaders he has personally reached out to in places like Egypt, Libya and Yemen.\xc2\xa0 He will also send a clear message that the United States will never retreat from the world. The United States will bring justice to those who harm Americans and the United States will stand strongly for our democratic values abroad.</p>\n<p>With respect to Iran, we have consistently framed that issue around Iran\'s profound failure to meet its international obligations with respect to its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, the United Nations General Assembly present -- the UNGA presents another opportunity for him to underscore that Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he see this, though, as a couple days of do no harm, or is this a real opportunity for him to make progress on these issues?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think it is a real opportunity.\xc2\xa0 The President always looks forward to the opportunity to address the General Assembly.\xc2\xa0 As you recall from last year, he gave a very important speech where he made clear the United States\' positions with regard to the Middle East peace process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it\'s a real moment for the United States to assert its values and its leadership role, to make clear where we stand in the midst of this remarkable period of transformation in the Arab world; how U.S. leadership, combined with the leadership of other nations, is helping the peoples of that region to overcome decades of tyranny and move towards democratic forms of government that are more responsive to their aspirations, that respect the rights of women and minorities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And he will also address, as I just mentioned, the most recent unrest, the fact that the United States government condemns and finds reprehensible the content of the video -- the anti-Muslim video -- but that the United States government was not responsible for it, and it is absolutely our position that there is never justification for the kinds of violence -- for any violence in response to a video.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll make that clear as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are some reports that the White House is intending on providing an executive order on cyber security.\xc2\xa0 Could you discuss that?\xc2\xa0 Are we going -- expecting any movements there, and could you tell us anything about the standards that might be set for it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 The President takes the issue of cyber security very seriously.\xc2\xa0 He had hoped that Congress would act legislatively on it, but I have no preview to give you of next steps.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any discussions of -- with Congress during a lame duck session?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 One would hope that action could be taken and progress could be made with Congress, but I have nothing specific for you on that.</p>\n<p>Dan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 In the 60 Minutes interview yesterday, the President, in talking about whether he felt any pressure from Israel on Iran, he said that, I\'m going to block that out -- any noise -- he says, "I am going to block that out, any noise that\'s out there."\xc2\xa0 Who represents that noise that the President was referring to?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President was making clear that his commitment and this country\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Israel and Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security is as strong as ever and unbreakable in nature.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a lot of noise around this issue at times. His point was clearly that his objective is to take every step possible to enhance Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security as part of our strong relationship with Israel.\xc2\xa0 It is demonstrated by the unprecedented level of cooperation this administration has had with Israel on matters of defense and security.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a fact testified to not just by the President and representatives of his, but by the Defense Minister of Israel, Ehud Barak, and others in the Israeli government.</p>\n<p>He is also quite clear that he is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And he has marshaled a consensus internationally that has never existed before behind a policy that pursues a diplomatic track with Iran as we attempt to compel Iran to give up its nuclear weapons ambitions on the one hand, and then a track that through punitive sanctions puts enormous economic and political pressure on Iran and isolates Tehran further and further from the world, making it clear that the price of refusing to abide by its nuclear -- by its international obligations with regards to its nuclear program is very high.</p>\n<p>As he has said, the President believes that the window of opportunity for a diplomatic resolution to this matter will not remain open indefinitely, and he retains all options on the table for keeping that commitment to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In that same interview, he was talking about the Arab Spring and support for the democratic reforms that took place there, but went on to say while that was the right thing to do, he knew there would be \xe2\x80\x9cbumps in the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s happening now, is it not bigger than just a bump in the road?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President was making clear that in this historic transformation that\'s taking place in the region, progress will not always come in a straight line, that there will be challenges in the region and in individual countries as they make that transition from decades of autocracy and tyranny to what we all hope will be governments that are more responsive to their people\xe2\x80\x99s aspirations, that are more democratic, and to economies that are more robust and prosperous and therefore more beneficial to millions and millions of residents of the region.</p>\n<p>But this transformation will not happen overnight, and it will encounter challenges along the way, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 And certainly the unrest in recent weeks represents one of these periods of challenge that the countries in the region must overcome.\xc2\xa0 I would point out that in Libya, there was a rather remarkable demonstration the other day against the militias that are trying to hijack the democratic transition in that country.\xc2\xa0 Average citizens in Libya, in Benghazi, protesting against the militias that they hold responsible for the unrest, they hold responsible for the murder of four American personnel.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a sign that the transition continues, even as it meets challenges.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Republicans jumping on the term -- the words that he used, as \xe2\x80\x9cbumps in the road,\xe2\x80\x9d sort of minimizing the vast challenges that exist in the region.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, is not minimizing what we all recognize as historic transformations taking place.\xc2\xa0 And the President is certainly not minimizing the challenges that those transformations are facing, as these countries in the region that have experienced or are experiencing democratic transitions move forward with them, move forward to systems of government that are hopefully more responsive to their people\xe2\x80\x99s aspirations -- more democratic, fairer and better for their people.</p>\n<p>I understand that Republicans in this case are searching for reeds to grab onto, but I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on these matters are very clear and very strong.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any bilats added to the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule in New York?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward very much to participating at the United Nation General Assembly.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be there later today through tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 He will speak, as you know, tomorrow morning to the General Assembly in remarks that I previewed just a moment ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has, just in the last few weeks, had extensive consultations with foreign leaders, including the leaders of Egypt, Israel, Yemen, Turkey, Libya, and those consultations will continue -- not just with leaders in the region but with leaders around the world.\xc2\xa0 It is part of the job of being President that that be the case, and he will certainly encounter many leaders tonight in New York as well as tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The complaint this morning about the line \xe2\x80\x9cbump in the road\xe2\x80\x9d is not that it\xe2\x80\x99s minimizing the Arab Spring, but it\xe2\x80\x99s minimizing the death of -- violent death of the U.S. Ambassador, three others.\xc2\xa0 And what -- when he said \xe2\x80\x9cbump in the road,\xe2\x80\x9d did he mean not to draw a parallel or not to define that event in Benghazi?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question, Ann, because that assertion is both desperate and offensive.\xc2\xa0 The President was referring to the transformations in the region, to this process that has -- only began less than two years ago, as we saw in Tunisia, and continues to this day with remarkable transformations occurring in countries around the region.\xc2\xa0 And obviously in these countries there are huge challenges, huge obstacles to the kinds of change that the people in these countries are demanding, to the kinds of governments that are democratic in nature and responsive to the interests of average citizens in these countries.</p>\n<p>That was the context of the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think I would say what I said to Dan, which is that there is a certain rather desperate attempt to grasp at words and phrases here to find political advantage, and in this case that\xe2\x80\x99s profoundly offensive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Ahmadinejad told reporters in New York this morning that he does not worry about the threat of an attack, especially by Israel, because \xe2\x80\x9cwe have defensive means at our disposal,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwe are ready to defend ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you think President Obama has not made it clear that he still has a military option?\xc2\xa0 Has he been too vague about that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s been vague at all.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been exceptionally clear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like President Ahmadinejad got the message.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, President Ahmadinejad says foolish, offensive and sometimes unintelligible things with great regularity.\xc2\xa0 What he should focus on is the failure of his government, of Iran, to abide by its international obligations, to abide by United Nations Security Council resolutions.</p>\n<p>That has resulted -- that failure has resulted, because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, in unprecedented pressure being applied to Tehran, being applied to Ahmadinejad\xe2\x80\x99s government that has resulted in diplomatic isolation as well as extreme economic consequences for Iran.\xc2\xa0 And that pressure continues.</p>\n<p>As you know, we, with our international partners, are regularly taking steps to increase pressure through punitive sanctions and other means on Tehran, as we continue to -- with the effort to try to compel Iran to make that choice to give up its nuclear weapons ambitions, to abide by its international obligations, and to, through doing that, have an opportunity to rejoin the community of nations.</p>\n<p>Thus far, Iran has failed to do that, and so the pressure will continue.\xc2\xa0 And let me be very clear, as the President has been -- every option available, and that includes the military option, remains on the table when it comes to keeping the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Iran not acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly on the bilaterals, you mentioned that he would see leaders tonight -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a party.\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting tonight\xe2\x80\x99s event -- that he will have any substantive talks with other leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not previewing any conversations he may or may not have.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not giving any details on encounters or conversations that he\xe2\x80\x99s yet to have.\xc2\xa0 All I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that he looks forward to it.\xc2\xa0 He will see a number of leaders, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, tonight; he will see more tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 He is giving remarks at the General Assembly tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And broadly speaking, he is intensively engaged, as he has been since he took the oath of office, in matters of foreign affairs and national security.\xc2\xa0 And just in the last several weeks, as you know, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve read them out, the President has been intensively engaged with leaders in the region, including the leaders of Israel, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Turkey and others.\xc2\xa0 And that will continue.\xc2\xa0 It is part of the job and a part of the job he takes extremely seriously.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you please let us know if he does have any chats?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll apprise you as I can.</p>\n<p>Wendell, and then Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In light of that, what do you make of the Republican complaint that the President has time to tape The View and no time for Prime Minister Netanyahu?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Wendell, Prime Minister Netanyahu is not in New York in the days the President is in New York, and the President is not in New York in the days when Prime Minister Netanyahu will be in New York.\xc2\xa0 The President just recently had a conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu that lasted more than an hour, I believe, and that was just one in countless conversations that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, the President has met with and spent time on the phone with Prime Minister Netanyahu more than with any leader since he took office.\xc2\xa0 And that is a reflective of the importance of and the closeness of the relationship between the United States and Israel, the importance of and the priority that the President places on America\xe2\x80\x99s support for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, as demonstrated by the unprecedented level of assistance that this administration has provided Israel for its security, the unprecedented level of cooperation between our militaries and intelligence communities in the effort to enhance Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.</p>\n<p>And that cooperation and deep partnership continues every day.\xc2\xa0 And the President had a very constructive conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu recently and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will in the future.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton will be meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu in New York, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, as I said, the President will be speaking with the Prime Minister as he does with some regularity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On this comment about the \xe2\x80\x9cnoise,\xe2\x80\x9d does the President think Prime Minister Netanyahu is involving himself in U.S. domestic politics?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I would point you to what the Prime Minister himself said when he appeared on American television I think a week ago Sunday.\xc2\xa0 And he said, A, that he\xe2\x80\x99s not interested in involving himself in American politics and, B, that he knows that President Obama is firmly committed to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a policy that\xe2\x80\x99s backed up with the most comprehensive international consensus that\xe2\x80\x99s ever existed against Iran, with the most punitive sanctions that have ever been imposed on a nation against Iran, with a degree of isolation that is unprecedented with regards to Iran, and with the firm commitment that every option available to him remains on the table in dealing with this challenge.</p>\n<p>Yes, Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I just want to try one more follow-up on the bilateral meetings.\xc2\xa0 What is the justification for the President not having sideline discussions with these world leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview every minute-by-minute of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule when he\xe2\x80\x99s in New York.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, the President just in recent weeks has had intensive consultations with leaders in the region, with the leaders of Turkey, of Egypt, of Israel, of Yemen, of Libya, of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And that process will continue.</p>\n<p>It is a simple fact that when you\xe2\x80\x99re President of the United States, your responsibility as Commander-in-Chief never ends, and you are constantly engaged in matter of foreign affairs and national security.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what this President is doing.\xc2\xa0 He looks forward to being able to present his case to the United Nations to make clear what the United States stands for, what its views are, what his views are in response to the recent unrest in the Muslim world, what American values are and how we project them, and why we support the democratic transitions in these countries in the region and why it is so important that the international community support those democratic transitions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that he has ongoing discussions with these world leaders, but given that he\xe2\x80\x99s missing an opportunity to sit down and talk with them, how does it not send a message that he\xe2\x80\x99s more concerned about not doing any harm in the weeks leading up to the election than actually --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I encourage you to await the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- addressing these pressing problems?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I thank you for the question, and I think that if you wait to hear the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech you will find it to be very bold and forthright about what his views are and what the United States -- the interests of the United States are with regards to this region and the unrest that\'s currently taking place within the broader context of the so-called Arab Spring.</p>\n<p>These are profound changes that are happening in the region and in the world, and the United States has led under President Obama and will continue to lead because it must lead.\xc2\xa0 And we cannot, as the President will say, we cannot retreat from the world.\xc2\xa0 We must engage, and we must promote our values.\xc2\xa0 We must absolutely defend our interests.\xc2\xa0 We must hold to account and bring to justice those who kill Americans or would kill Americans, and that is the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment with regards to those who killed four Americans in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 You will hear some very clear things from the President tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And I urge you to wait for those remarks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, just one more on comments that President Obama made over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy biggest disappointment is that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed the tone in Washington as much as I would have liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that he can change the tone in Washington if he\xe2\x80\x99s granted another four years, or is he waving the white flag at his Republican --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely convinced that with the insistence of the American people that the tone can change, that together we can bring about that change in Washington.\xc2\xa0 As he made clear, it requires the voices of average Americans across the country making clear to their elected officials in Washington that they will not tolerate the kinds of partisan gridlock that is often waged and engaged in for the sake of small-bore political advantage at the expense of the interests of average Americans across the country.</p>\n<p>And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about how he hopes that if he is reelected, elected officials in Washington, in Congress will begin to move forward on some of these very important issues that have divided us, but to which there are fairly clear bipartisan solutions, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a willingness to compromise.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, and has been reported widely, when Republican leaders in Washington decided, in some cases on the day of his inauguration, that their agenda would be driven by a desire to defeat him, when the leader of Republicans in the Senate said that his number-one objective as leader of the Republican Party in the Senate was to defeat the President -- if he\xe2\x80\x99s reelected, that agenda, that priority is taken away because he will no longer be a candidate for office, he will be serving his second term.\xc2\xa0 And that presents an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to come together, to set aside maximalist positions, and deal with some of these difficult issues that have challenged us in these last several years.</p>\n<p>I would also point out that even with the kind of lack of tonal change in Washington, and even with the kinds of disagreements we\xe2\x80\x99ve had, this President with this Congress has been able to accomplish significant things, including extension of the payroll tax cut, including a measure by Congress ensuring that 7 million American students won\xe2\x80\x99t have their loan rates doubled, including a number of issues that are very important to the American economy and the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the opportunity for greater cooperation exists, we hope, after this election.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in the 60 Minutes interview the President also said that Israel was \xe2\x80\x9cone of our closest allies in the region,\xe2\x80\x9d and I guess the Middle East. Who is our closest ally?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say numerous times that Israel is our closest ally in the region.\xc2\xa0 We have an unshakeable bond with Israel.\xc2\xa0 We have a commitment to Israel and to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security that is profound and unique.\xc2\xa0 And that is demonstrated by the policies of this administration as well as the policies of the President\xe2\x80\x99s predecessors.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as I just said in answer to some other questions, President Obama has taken action to assist Israel with its security that is unprecedented.\xc2\xa0 The depth of our cooperation, the amount of our assistance has never been greater.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Israeli leaders verify that.</p>\n<p>The President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon is categorical and clear.\xc2\xa0 He, upon taking office, took an approach that changed the dynamic of this situation, a dynamic, which, prior to him taking office, had much of the world divided on the issue.\xc2\xa0 He has through his efforts unified the international community in pressuring Iran and viewing Iran as the problem.\xc2\xa0 And the result has been an unprecedented regime of sanctions, as well as isolation that this President believes needs to be pursued because the surest way to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon is if Iran itself decides to forego nuclear weapons in a verifiable way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know you said the President has gotten readouts, has had consultations with leaders throughout the region.\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t there something different between having a phone conversation and meeting and talking with someone in person?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President will see a number of leaders tonight and tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But I would make the point that he does not wait for the annual meeting in New York to have meetings with or consultations with foreign leaders.\xc2\xa0 He has a fairly robust schedule of meetings with and conversations with foreign leaders.\xc2\xa0 The ones I just mentioned have had to do with the recent unrest in the Arab world.\xc2\xa0 But those kinds of consultations continue all the time, including in earlier parts of this year and continuing to this day -- regular consultations with leaders in Europe over the situation in the eurozone, as well as with leaders in different parts of the world over different issues.\xc2\xa0 And that continues and will continue going forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing the reason you\xe2\x80\x99re getting so many questions about the absence of bilats is that last year the President had 13 bilateral meetings with key foreign leaders during his U.N. visit; this year, you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell us of any.\xc2\xa0 So what is different about last year and this year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, I would simply say that this President looks forward to speaking tomorrow, will lay out clearly what his views are on the recent unrest in the Muslim world, on the United States\xe2\x80\x99 role in the region, the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s absolute commitment to holding accountable and bringing to justice those who killed Americans, his firm belief that while the video was offensive and disgusting and was the product of -- was the work of a handful of individuals and in no way represented the views of the United States government or the American people, violence and reaction to it is unjustified.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He will discuss broadly the American role in the transformations taking place in the region.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue, as President, as he has over these past several weeks, and he will going forward, his intensive consultations with leaders in the region over the current period of unrest in the Muslim world.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is the President does not wait for an annual meeting to have consultations with or meetings with foreign leaders, and they will continue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the U.N. meeting has always lent itself to a number of bilats, but not this year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have no meetings to announce to you, Mark.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule includes the reception this evening.\xc2\xa0 It includes his speech tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that I don\'t have details for you.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly clear, based on the President\xe2\x80\x99s engagement with foreign leaders just in the last several weeks, that he is intensively engaged in matters of national security and foreign policy as he has been throughout his presidency.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He is the host of that reception tonight?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe that\'s the case, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you leaving the door open to him having bilats and saying we just don\'t have any on schedule?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have no bilats scheduled.\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t want to -- I can\'t give you a minute-by-minute account of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule since it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May we follow on Mark?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If Ahmadinejad or Chavez, any others come up to the President if they\'re invited tonight, will the President speak to them?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Connie, I just -- that kind of thing has happened in the past.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t anticipate who he\xe2\x80\x99ll run into.</p>\n<p>Karen -- I mean Kate, sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s okay.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. have any apprehension about Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the U.N. later this week?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there a concern that possible Israeli actions on Iran or what Netanyahu said recently could further add to the turmoil and the tension in Egypt and Libya, other countries in the Middle East?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just point you to the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s appearances on American television a week ago Sunday, refer you to the remarks I just made.\xc2\xa0 This President will continue to work with Prime Minister Netanyahu, with the Israeli government on their shared objective of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t anticipate any other issues with that beyond the importance of this objective and the fact that Iran has thus far stubbornly refused to abide by its international obligations.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Netanyahu will be meeting with Secretary Clinton, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that they will go over the same subjects in terms of our shared commitment to this objective, and the same subjects with regards to U.S. support for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security that the President and Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed in their lengthy phone conversation just recently.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no concern that any remarks he could make could be incendiary to -- and cause more riots and tension in parts of the Middle East?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s purely speculative, and the answer is no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one quick question.\xc2\xa0 Do you know -- why didn\'t the President say that Israel is the closest ally in --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has said this -- this was a lengthy interview.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear again and again and again that Israel is our closest ally in the region, that we have a unique relationship with Israel, bonds with Israel that are unlike our bonds with any other nation.\xc2\xa0 We have an unshakeable commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, and we have proven that commitment -- this administration has -- with unprecedented assistance to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he misspoke in the interview?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, again, has made clear on numerous occasions that Israel is our closest ally in the region.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Friday, Governor Romney released his tax returns for 2011 and a summary of the last 10 years.\xc2\xa0 Does that resolve the tax return issue for President Obama?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s a question I think best directed to the campaign.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken of it here, though, in terms of the President believes that as a candidate that Governor Romney has an obligation to the American people to be forthcoming.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I would say, Bill, as I have in the past, the President believes that the tradition of candidates releasing their entire returns, many years of them, is a useful and valuable one for the American people.\xc2\xa0 It\'s certainly one that he has abided by.\xc2\xa0 I have noted that it began I guess just coincidentally with Governor Romney of Michigan back in 1968 and it\'s a process this President think is important, even if it might be uncomfortable.\xc2\xa0 But when you run for President, you should be an open book, and that\xe2\x80\x99s his view.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So therefore, he did not meet the test --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the campaign has spoken to this.\xc2\xa0 But the President\'s view hasn\'t changed, which is that it is an important part of the process of running for President to demonstrate, by the release of your complete returns for many years, an openness to the American people about who you are and your financial past, and that that\xe2\x80\x99s a useful tradition that has been abided by, by most major party candidates since it was begun in 1968.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could you detail anything about the President and the CGI?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we\'ve read out any or provided any details yet previewing the President\'s speech at the Clinton Global Initiative.\xc2\xa0 He looks forward to giving those remarks.\xc2\xa0 He thinks that the work of the Global Initiative -- President Clinton\'s Global Initiative is very important.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure we\'ll have more details for you as we get closer to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me ask you this as well.\xc2\xa0 Do you think poverty, especially as the U.S. Census Bureau has come out with American poverty issues -- 1 in every 6 Americans are in poverty -- do you think he\'s going to address issues of global poverty at the CGI?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to preview his remarks at this time.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the broader issue is one that is of great significance and that the President views as very important, because it\'s all about global economic growth and improving the plight of people in poverty around the world is an important objective because it increases stability, improves the lives of people around the world, and it\'s very much a focus of his foreign policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what\'s the campaign and the White House response -- basically the White House -- on the fact that Mitt Romney will be addressing the CGI as well this year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there is a tradition, at least since the CGI has been up and running, for this to be the case.\xc2\xa0 I believe Senator McCain spoke to CGI four years ago.\xc2\xa0 And the President thinks that\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly appropriate</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, to get back to the topic du jour for a moment -- the President does seem to understand, though, that some of the "noise," as he put it, is being caused by the fact that he\'s not meeting Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 Is that a safe assumption on our part?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Safe assumption that the "noise" is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, that he understands that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is a consumer of the news that you produce, as we\'ve discussed.\xc2\xa0 He\'s aware of trends in the news.\xc2\xa0 I think his focus is on the importance of the relationship that the United States has with Israel, the importance of his commitment and the United States\' commitment to Israel\'s security, the importance of the shared goal that he and Prime Minister Netanyahu have of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and the steps that we are taking with our international partners to meet that commitment and ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of what he is focused on, with regards to these issues -- with the U.S.-Israeli relationship, and, in particular, the challenge faced by Iran\'s persistent refusal to abide by its international obligations.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, over the weekend the Congressional Black Caucus held as part of its annual dinner a forum on the issue of same-sex marriage.\xc2\xa0 Views reportedly differed, but there was a lot of opposition to the President\'s support for marriage equality.\xc2\xa0 Even the Reverend Jesse Jackson said he supports same-sex marriage and (inaudible) understand why the issue had gained providence.\xc2\xa0 How would you evaluate the continued support of the black community to the President as a result of his support for marriage equality?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President said at the time and firmly believes that people have different views on this issue, and he respects that.\xc2\xa0 He has made clear that his support for the right of every American to decide who he or she loves and the right to marriage is a matter of civil marriage, and that religious institutions -- churches and -- have their own sacraments and decide what they are.\xc2\xa0 And he respects differing views on this.<br/>\n\tHe expressed his opinion and he has taken positions on different matters of policy, but he certainly respects the views of others.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has talked about his support for marriage equality in subsequent speeches, but would you expect the President to make his case for support for marriage equality if he were to address a venue specifically for the black community?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of ifs and bits of speculation there.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very clear about his position.\xc2\xa0 He had a number of conversations at the time when he made his views public, and I\'m sure, given the opportunity, he will express his views in the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Victoria.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said in the 60 Minutes interview that if Mitt Romney wanted to start a war he should say so.\xc2\xa0 Does he actually think that Mitt Romney does want to start a war?\xc2\xa0 Was he simply exasperated, or was he being provocative?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he was saying what he has said in the past, which is that while there has been a lot of rhetorical criticism from Republicans, including Governor Romney, about the President\'s approach on Iran, there is no substantive difference that we can discern.\xc2\xa0 And if the distinction then is a willingness or desire to go to war, then that should be clearly stated, because otherwise, the things that have been called for by critics -- punitive sanctions, diplomatic and political isolation -- the kinds of actions that this President has taken and has led on in his effort to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, are the same that his critics say should be taken.</p>\n<p>So I think that if there is -- if the issue is what the distinction is -- if the distinction is a willingness to go to war, then it should be clearly stated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is part of the reluctance to meet, say, with President Morsi, that it might just not look good to meet with an Islamist President at this point in the election cycle?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President spoke with President Morsi of Egypt at length very recently.\xc2\xa0 I read out in considerable detail that phone conversation, and I am sure that President Obama will continue to have consultations with the Egyptian leader going forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He made clear in that conversation that he expects the government of Egypt and the governments of other regions in the\xc2\xa0 -- other countries in the region to abide by their obligations to provide security to diplomatic facilities that they host.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation he had with other leaders in the region.</p>\n<p>So I think he was -- we were very clear about the fact that he had this extensive conversation with the Egyptian President, the contents of that conversation.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure there will be more consultations going forward.</p>\n<p>Steve, then Donovan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that the U.N. speech is coming 40-odd days before the election, how much of it should be viewed as a sort of accounting and a justification of the foreign policy that the President\'s achieved over the last four years?\xc2\xa0 And in that sense, is this year\'s speech perhaps more aimed as much of a domestic audience than the normal kind of foreign audience that you would expect him to speak?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is not a campaign speech.\xc2\xa0 This is a speech in which the President will make clear his views, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s positions and America\xe2\x80\x99s role with regards to a lot of transformation that\'s happening in the world, and that will be the focus of his remarks.</p>\n<p>Donovan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 At the risk of asking the same question a number of times, on Mark\xe2\x80\x99s question, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that we actually got an answer.\xc2\xa0 He gave you some stats that last year the President has 13 bilats during the General Assembly, and this year there is zero.\xc2\xa0 What is the specific reason?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President -- I can tell you again that the President has had extensive conversations with leaders in the region where there has been unrest of late.\xc2\xa0 He will continue to have those conversations.\xc2\xa0 He will see leaders from a variety of regions tonight at a reception in New York as part of the General Assembly meeting, and will deliver very important remarks tomorrow at UNGA.\xc2\xa0 And his consultations and meetings with foreign leaders will continue going forward as they -- with the same kind of intensity that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen of late as dictated and required by events in the world and by this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to U.S. national security interests.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is his scheduled too packed this year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has obviously got a busy schedule.\xc2\xa0 He has a busy schedule all the time.\xc2\xa0 It is a fact that he has in recent weeks been intensively engaged in matters of foreign affairs.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s part of being President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here at home, how soon is the President going to sign the CR?\xc2\xa0 And also now that Congress has left, and given the drought this summer, how anxious is the White House to get a farm bill?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, a comprehensive farm bill is something that Congress should have acted on and did not, and that is unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a -- as for the CR, I don\'t have a timing for you.\xc2\xa0 We can get back to you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Goyal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, personally, how does the President feel about the United Nations itself as an organization as far as Human Rights Council and other issues are concerned?\xc2\xa0 And second, if he\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with President Zardari -- Pakistan is also burning because of this anti-Islam -- or Muslim --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no scheduling announcements to make in terms of encounters with foreign leaders.</p>\n<p>Look, the President believes that the United Nations can act effectively, but does not always act effectively.\xc2\xa0 It did act effectively and it has acted effectively in terms of isolating Iran, taking aggressive action to hold Iran accountable for its failure to live up to its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 It acted effectively in response to the imminent threat to citizens in Libya.\xc2\xa0 It has failed to act, the Security Council, because of vetoes by Russia and China in response to the heinous actions of President Assad in Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President\xe2\x80\x99s views are case-by-case and very clear about when the United Nations has come together, when the United Nations Security Council has acted appropriately, and when it has not.\xc2\xa0 I mean, beyond that, I don\'t have a broader assessment for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, since the Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh, is not coming this year in New York at the U.N., has the President spoken with him?\xc2\xa0 Because India has recently passed the opening of the doors for the foreign conference, including hundreds of American companies go to India.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have any other foreign leader conversations to read out to you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, in the back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 First is, Romney has released a new ad on China, and the Obama campaign reacts to that.\xc2\xa0 Do you think this might sour future U.S.-China relations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The ad by Governor Romney?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, the overall China bashing --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I got this question fairly recently.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we have an extremely important, broad relationship with China, and there are significant, vast areas of cooperation and there are areas of disagreement.\xc2\xa0 The President makes clear and has made clear since he took office that when there are clear indications of unfair trade practices that harm American workers or harm American companies, his administration will take action.\xc2\xa0 That was true with imports of Chinese tires and it\xe2\x80\x99s been true of, I believe, eight actions taken up at the World Trade Organization.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment, that he believes that if we have a trading relationship that\xe2\x80\x99s fair, that allows for fair competition by American companies and American workers, that that\xe2\x80\x99s beneficial for both countries and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly beneficial for the American economy and American workers.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s his approach.</p>\n<p>But it does not mean that we cannot continue to cooperate with China, as we have on a variety of issues.\xc2\xa0 Our relationship is very complex, it is very broad, and it is very deep.\xc2\xa0 And the President is committed to all aspects of it, and he is committed to making clear, through the actions that he\xe2\x80\x99s taken and in his conversations with Chinese leaders, where we disagree and where we need to remedy inequities that have existed in the past that have put American workers and American companies at a disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second question -- does President pay attention to recent China-Japan dispute over Diaoyu Island?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I addressed this in I think my last televised briefing and I would refer you to those comments.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:32 P.M.
