<h1>Press Briefing By Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, 12/9/2009</h1>
b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>1:45 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, I\'ll just get slightly organized.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said not too long ago that a signing on a START I replacement would happen soon, and I\'m wondering if you can flesh that out and if that might be something that\'s going to be happening in conjunction with the President\'s trip to Copenhagen perhaps.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We do not have an agreement yet.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we continue to take part in negotiations with the Russians on a replacement START treaty.\xc2\xa0 Obviously our hope is to get one done, but can\'t plan for a signing ceremony until something is done and we\'ve certainly made no arrangements for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you close to a signing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\'re getting closer and making progress on an agreement.\xc2\xa0 I know there are still issues that have to be worked out that stand in the way of that ultimate agreement.\xc2\xa0 And our principals continue to meet and brief the President on what\'s happening, and that will continue until we do get an agreement.\xc2\xa0 We\'re optimistic that we can get one.\xc2\xa0 Whether or not that happens by Copenhagen at this point is just hard to say.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to ask about the jobs.\xc2\xa0 Some congressional Democrats have said that they\'d like a jobs package but could cost up to $200 billion.\xc2\xa0 Now, the White House has been very careful to put no price tag on the President\'s initiatives, but is there a cost ceiling that you\'d impose on the efforts to boost jobs, given you\'re trying to cut deficits in the future?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President would say is the ideas in the areas that he outlined yesterday are targeted approaches to creating an environment where businesses can start hiring again.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believed he had a good meeting today with Democrats and Republicans, and began by outlining a couple of the things that he talked about yesterday\xc2\xa0 -- first and foremost, how do we help small businesses, zero capital gains tax for small business, incentives for hiring, incentives for depreciation, and things like that.\xc2\xa0 And the President mentioned, along with infrastructure, the second thing he talked about, the President discussed with Democrats and Republicans that indeed those were initiatives that in the past have enjoyed strong bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think the President believes there\'s a commonality to these ideas that he\'s proposed and that he\'s heard from Capitol Hill that they\'ve proposed that we think we can find agreement on and hopefully get some progress on.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what that ultimate figure is.\xc2\xa0 Obviously part of what the President wanted to discuss with leaders today was what might be in that package. This is not a one-way street.</p>\n<p>I will say when it comes to the deficit, the President agreed with and reiterated the fact that we have to do -- we have to have a plan for addressing in the medium- and long-term fiscal responsibility.\xc2\xa0 The President also reiterated that we are not going, though, to solve that problem of our long-term fiscal health if our growth rate is where it was in the first quarter of this year, which is in excess of -6 percent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me just, for your -- some visual stuff that the President talked about.\xc2\xa0 This just gives you a sense of where we\'ve been, right?\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to go to that in a second.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t worry, the big board is coming.\xc2\xa0 Save the big finale.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, this just gives you a sense of the average in quarters of our jobs picture.\xc2\xa0 In the first quarter the average was nearly negative 700,000 jobs; in the second quarter, minus 428,000; in the third quarter, minus 199,000.\xc2\xa0 In the previous two months we\'ve gone from minus 111,000 to minus 11,000.<br/>\nSo obviously what happened in the beginning of the year -- we\'re seeing progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What I talked about a second ago, in terms of economic growth, the first quarter we saw our economic growth contract in excess of 6 percent; second quarter, negative 0.7; and then for the first time in a year, positive job growth -- negative 11,000 jobs lost was, sadly, the most positive jobs report that the country has enjoyed in almost two years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now that Keith has spoiled my big surprise.\xc2\xa0 This I think gives you a sense -- and some of you have seen this when we did briefings on the Recovery Act -- this gives you a sense of the genuine depth that we\'re in in terms of employment.\xc2\xa0 This number is employment, full employment, at the time that each recession began.\xc2\xa0 So we have 1990, 2001, and 1981.\xc2\xa0 This continuum shows the number of months since that recession began, and these percentages show you where we are in terms of employment.\xc2\xa0 This gives you a sense of the sheer depth that we\'re trying to pull ourselves out of.\xc2\xa0 And it also gives you a sense of why the President believes we have to take strong, targeted, but continued action to address joblessness.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the jobs hole is very large, but is there a ceiling, is there a price tag that\'s too high?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that we\'ll work through Congress -- work with Congress on.\xc2\xa0 I will say I do think that -- I mean, even Leader Boehner said that he would like to be there to support a plan for jobs.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\'s certainly a positive development.\xc2\xa0 We hope that there will be bipartisan help and support for dealing with something that we know affects everybody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which of these charts was the one that the President showed John Boehner?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This one.\xc2\xa0 But I mean, this is what everybody in the meeting saw.\xc2\xa0 This again is just -- this is a chart we\'ve used before.\xc2\xa0 As you guys know, where these lines go from solid to dotted is where it\'s marked that -- by the dating committee that the recession ended.\xc2\xa0 So you see that the point at which the recession ends is -- and this is not updated, but shows you that in the most two previous examples, 1990 and 2001, when the "recession ended" wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the bottom of the jobs picture.</p>\n<p>Again, it just gives you a sense of the type of problem in employment that we have facing our country -- why the President believes we need to take strong action.\xc2\xa0 Plus I just wanted to use the board.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It looked really good.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions, the first one on the bipartisanship issue.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you have the President coming out saying that he wants to work together, but just moments later you have Republican leaders coming out saying that the White House just wants to blame Republicans, saying that this administration just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, how do you move forward together if that\'s the climate coming out of this meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you come together understanding this.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, the American people have watched for decades the blame game.\xc2\xa0 If the blame game put people to work we\'d all be rolling in money.\xc2\xa0 The blame game -- I\'m glad some people want to continue playing the blame game; that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get anybody a job.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cut people\'s taxes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is time -- I will say the President -- has the President been frustrated about this?\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We took some extraordinary actions.\xc2\xa0 We wish there would have been more Republican support for taking those actions and pulling our economy back from an economic cliff, falling into another Great Depression.</p>\n<p>Setting all that aside, we\'re now at a certain point where we have got to begin to fill in the enormity of the hole that this economic downturn created.\xc2\xa0 The President is willing to work with Democrats and Republicans -- and again, I think it was important that the President started out the meeting by mentioning that two of the ideas that the President had talked about in his speech -- two of the three ideas were ideas that have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>We heard throughout the recovery debate that there needed to be more money put into infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President outlined.\xc2\xa0 We heard in -- even up to as recently as the past few days, we have to help small business get access to capital, cut their taxes, ensure that we\'re doing all that they can to create an environment for them to hire more.\xc2\xa0 The President agrees.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s time that everybody took "yes" for an answer.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if the attitude is that this administration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get it, is this administration then willing to navigate this alone?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President will do what has to be done to help the American people.\xc2\xa0 The President is hopeful, through this meeting today, that Republicans agree.\xc2\xa0 But again, if the President outlines ideas that the Republicans have previously supported, and then Republicans seem unwilling to support the ideas they supported then now, you can leave it up to others to judge why it is they don\'t want to participate in a solution that we all agree and we\'ve said in the past would put people back to work.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They say they can\'t sign on to spending more money.\xc2\xa0 That\'s all -- they say he\'s fiscally irresponsible.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, rich, given the fact that the largest driver in our fiscal irresponsibility were a series of programs that weren\xe2\x80\x99t paid for -- tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 that weren\xe2\x80\x99t paid for; Medicare prescription drug benefit that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t paid for; wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that weren\xe2\x80\x99t paid for.\xc2\xa0 Again, the debate that we\'re having on health care now is partly about how to pay for it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The second leading driver in our fiscal irresponsibility has been the downturn in the economy.\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, we are not going to find ourselves lifted out of our fiscal situation if our economy contracts at 6 or 6.5 percent a quarter.\xc2\xa0 There isn\xe2\x80\x99t an economist on the planet that you could find that would say, yes, your economy can contract at 6.5 a quarter, 6.4 percent a quarter, and you\'ll be able to lift your way out of a budget deficit or increasing debt.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\'s what the President believes -- that\'s why the President believes we have to take some further steps to ensure that we get back to economic growth, but also that we get back to a medium- and long-term recipe for fiscal responsibility.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have an unrelated question, on the military.\xc2\xa0 At West Point last week, the President talked about signing a letter of condolence to the family of each American who gives their life in Iraq or Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 What about the families of military personnel who take their own lives -- does the President believe that those families deserve a letter of condolence as well?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the previous policy that didn\xe2\x80\x99t write those letters can and should be reviewed, and that review is ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much longer -- I know it\'s been under review here for some time.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the review was announced sometime in the past couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update on it, but I can certainly get it.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President reviewed earlier in the administration the rules surrounding photography at Dover, leaving -- based on the recommendation from the Secretary of Defense -- leaving that decision up to the individual families of the deceased.\xc2\xa0 Some have decided and some have not decided to make those transfers public.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully we can conclude this review shortly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After his speech, one military family told CNN that the President\'s comments were painful to them because their son took his own life, and they have yet to receive a letter of condolence from the President.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s why we\'re reviewing it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\'s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what would you say to that family?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The first thing that I would say and I\'m sure the President would say is to thank that family for the courageous service that they exhibited on behalf of all of us in this country so that we might enjoy the freedoms that we have.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- regardless of what happens, nothing lessens the amazing contribution and sacrifice that\'s made.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what the President would tell that family and would tell other families.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they feel that the sacrifice has sort of been diminished or minimized.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s -- again, that\'s precisely why the President wanted to review this policy.\xc2\xa0 If the President didn\'t care, the policy would remain unchanged and unexamined.\xc2\xa0 The President cares deeply and has asked for that review to take place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\'t have a time frame on when he might --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will keep you updated on where they are.</p>\n<p>Helen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions, Robert.\xc2\xa0 How does the President feel about the dropping of the public option in health care?</p>\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I think you all should have heard the President\'s comments at the announcement on community health care centers where he supports the ideas that we\'ve read about from the Senate in the past few hours as good policy and a way to increase the choice that people have through greater competition and in helping to move legislation to reform our health care system forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other question is, does the President feel any embarrassment upon accepting a peace prize when he\'s escalating a war, a big war?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Helen, the President will obviously address the notion --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in his speech, audibly -- the President will address the notion that last week he authorized a 30,000- person increase in our commitment to Afghanistan, and this week accepts a prize for peace.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I will say, Helen, that the President understands and again will also recognize that he doesn\'t belong in the same discussion as Mandela and Mother Theresa.\xc2\xa0 But I think what the President is proud of is the steps that this administration has taken to reengage the world; that through that reengagement we see some of that reengagement is to bring increased peace and stability to this big planet, and is -- he is proud that the committee recognized that this nation has once again reemerged and engaging the world in greater pursuits.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\'re going to war and he\'s accepting the peace prize.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And something he will -- something he will, again, address directly in the speech tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a follow-up?\xc2\xa0 Obviously it\'s a historic trip for the President.\xc2\xa0 Has the President shared any of the thoughts that he shared, sentiments with the former Vice President who also was a recipient of the same prize?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think most of the discussion that was had with Vice President Gore was -- dealt with upcoming meetings on climate change in Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you also give us a bit of a preview of the trip itself, who\'s traveling, what\'s happening over there, when they came back --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me get those guys to send stuff around.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President and the First Lady, as I talked to you guys earlier -- or yesterday, Maya and Konrad will also travel aboard Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll get any additional friends or family.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just to follow, the President was saying, when he was addressing a school in Virginia, that if he had a choice, he would have a dinner with Mahatma Gandhi.\xc2\xa0 That means, as far as this award is concerned, peace award, he is also a believer in Mahatma Gandhi\'s ideas of peace and nonviolence.\xc2\xa0 Is that something fit --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Is that something --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Something fit with Mahatma Gandhi and his -- the President\'s thoughts and ideas?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think what he\'s -- certainly he\'s been asked if he could gather thoughts from those that walked on this Earth before him, there are a number of people, including Gandhi, that obviously he\'d be interested in getting their thoughts on.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s addressed specifically tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, he has a great respect in India.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AIDS advocates are taking a shot at the five-year plan for the President\'s emergency program for AIDS because it decreases the number of people who will receive anti-retrovirals over the next five years -- as opposed to the number who received them in the last five years -- in favor of cheaper alternatives for health care at a lower level, something that apparently was proposed by Dr. Emanuel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some -- I don\'t have any guidance from OMB on that, on what their involvement has been.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President cares deeply about this issue and has talked not just about medicine but steps that have to be taken in terms of prevention to ensure anti-retrovirals are not necessary.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir -- yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President -- sir, gosh -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was looking at Steve before you, so --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Did the President in the meeting with Congress tell the Republicans and Minority Leader Boehner that they almost seem to be rooting against recovery?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President did mention, and I think Republicans agreed, that the room was not without politics, and that politics obviously has -- I think politics has clearly played a role in many of their statements and votes on the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s any big secret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He thinks Republicans basically want the jobless rate to stay above 10 percent --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President would like Democrats and Republicans alike to prove to the American people that we can set aside whatever narrow political agendas anybody has in order to address the severity of the economic downturn and the joblessness that\'s resulted from it.\xc2\xa0 And I can think of nothing better than taking the President up on, again, two of the ideas that have normally enjoyed very bipartisan support:\xc2\xa0 increasing our investment in infrastructure, which will create jobs; and help to hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the country in terms of getting access to credit; tax incentives for hiring.</p>\n<p>Look, again, the most important thing is those things in a nonpartisan environment would get the support of Republicans and Democrats alike.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that should be any different with this President, nor would it or should it be with any other President.\xc2\xa0 I think we have a challenge that the American people have laid before us, and that is to solve the problems that they have without getting involved in that blame game.\xc2\xa0 And I think --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t the President part of that blame game, too?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he took the partisan swipe yesterday in that speech.\xc2\xa0 I mean, even here you talked about their failed stewardship on the deficit.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this administration doesn\'t miss an opportunity to blame the past administration.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look -- well, Savannah, I appreciate the ability to forget what happened every -- to forget every --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But my point --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, but understand we\'ve -- I appreciate the ability to forget anything that happened before we got here.\xc2\xa0 The President didn\'t -- the President inherited an economic downturn, he inherited a massive budget deficit.\xc2\xa0 He understands one thing: The American people put him here to solve the problems that were created however and by whoever they were created.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President is going to do.\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to make decisions that won\'t be altogether wildly popular with the American people.\xc2\xa0 But I think he believes that the American people will understand that we\'re making those tough decisions to pull ourselves back from falling into another Great Depression.</p>\n<p>It is hard to argue, Savannah, it is hard to argue that the steps taken in the Recovery Act didn\'t directly lead to the first economic growth in a year.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t believe me; ask John McCain\'s economist who said we created jobs, that we put ourselves on a path towards economic growth.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not me.\xc2\xa0 That\'s -- that was our rival\'s chief economist in the campaign.</p>\n<p>I think what the President believes is we have a unique opportunity -- setting aside all of that -- to move forward on behalf of the American people; to do it in a way that truly addresses their problems without falling into the convenient political back-and-forth and games that have always governed Washington.\xc2\xa0 We can show the American people this -- at this time and this year that it\'s possible to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said the President does recognize that he\'s got the job now, so now it falls to him to fix it.\xc2\xa0 Is there any statute of limitations, though, on how often he may mention what he inherited or the mess he inherited or how the past administration failed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, it would be easy to put it all in a box and just forget about it, but we didn\'t get here overnight.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to get out of our problems overnight.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not part of the blame game.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just -- it\'s a fact of life.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s part of the blame game.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think it is.\xc2\xa0 Again, people made conscious decisions to support tax cuts in 2001 and 2003.\xc2\xa0 People made conscious decisions to support an increase in -- to add a benefit to Medicare without paying for it, right?\xc2\xa0 We know that. People made conscious decisions to authorize wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and not pay for them.\xc2\xa0 The President recognizes that the era of continued free lunches is over.</p>\n<p>Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on health care.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to see if I can get you to be a little more specific on this Senate tentative deal.\xc2\xa0 It involves two pieces -- a new health care plan put together by the Office of Personnel Management and an expansion of Medicare to the near-retired, 55 to 65.\xc2\xa0 Does the President want to see -- would the President need to see both of those pieces as the deal moves forward, are they dependent on each other?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think a lot of the details of this obviously are being examined currently by CBO.\xc2\xa0 I hesitate -- not having been in the room and the administration wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the room right before they walked out and announced this, my sense is -- I don\'t want to prejudge this, but my sense is that these two pieces fit together in a way that might be hard to break apart.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And my other question was what role did the White House play in brokering this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No different than the role we\'ve played throughout this process in providing technical support and advice.\xc2\xa0 Again, this was -- throughout this process the -- obviously we were aware of the negotiations that were ongoing, but not in the room as this was tentatively agreed to, as you said, and announced last evening.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one thing on jobs.\xc2\xa0 I understand that the President is never going to accept this demand that there would be no new spending for jobs.\xc2\xa0 But the other two pieces --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Republicans had three suggestions:\xc2\xa0 a freeze in federal spending, no tax increases until unemployment declined to a certain level --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been pretty -- let\'s be clear, the President has been pretty clear on taxes and the President has cut taxes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the other was no new regulations.\xc2\xa0 There are tax increases slated for when the Bush tax cuts expire.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if he would entertain this idea that you would create some kind of moratorium on tax increases until there\'s --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\'t want to get ahead of the budget process that\'s ongoing.\xc2\xa0 I think the President reiterated his support for, in that room, some certainty on taxes, and reiterating again that he had cut taxes.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any clarity yet on the charity decision?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the President is yet to make final decisions on that.\xc2\xa0 If we have that -- as soon as we have that we\'ll pass it along.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will it be announced before he accepts the prize?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hope so, but I don\'t know the exact answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But for sure he\'s not going to get a check with his medal, right?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not believe that\'s the case because that then becomes -- then we fall into Jonathan\'s problem about taxable income.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What charities are being considered?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s given obviously to a very broad range of charities in the past.\xc2\xa0 He has helped use money to create micro-financing projects much like his mother worked on in different parts of the world, and all of those are certainly actively under consideration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on climate change, the omnibus bill has been assembled and there\'s $1.3 billion in there to help developing nations meet the standards for global warming.\xc2\xa0 Is that the figure that the President takes to Copenhagen next week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some guidance from the climate guys on this.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know whether that\'s a final number or not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does that sound?\xc2\xa0 Does that sound about right?\xc2\xa0 Is it adequate?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll ask them if that sounds about right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be any added values -- will the U.S. be offering something else other than --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me talk to -- and see what he has on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one other question, different subject?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the state of play with Japan and the negotiations over the airbase relocation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re continuing to engage the government of Japan in negotiations that will maintain our alliance as well as reduce the impact of our bases on local communities.\xc2\xa0 We have an agreement with the previous administration in Japan.\xc2\xa0 We set up a working group to discuss the implementation of that agreement and we\'re anxious for those conversations to continue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say we have an agreement, is the U.S. still opposed then to relocation under the new --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have an agreement, but what this working group is going to discuss is the implementation of what\'s already been agreed to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There have been reports of a breakdown in talks.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I think the only way to make progress is to continue that working -- standing up that working group and having that discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that, Robert --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- would the President be open to meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama in Copenhagen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We did that like a couple of weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know where -- again, I think this is appropriately being handled right now with our ambassador there and others in terms of making progress.\xc2\xa0 I think this was discussed just a couple of weeks ago and I think the working group working, we would believe, is the best way to continue that progress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So not at the top level?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one group that didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the President\'s speech on jobs yesterday was the Congressional Black Caucus.\xc2\xa0 You might say that\'s just a group, but since he\'s the first African American President --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, correct the record --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You may say that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, all right, just -- go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying he\'s the first African American President --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\'s be fair and balanced.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the -- is the President concerned that they are not satisfied with his jobs plan?\xc2\xa0 Does the President plan to reach out to CBC members?\xc2\xa0 Where do things stand on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- Congressman Clyburn was a member -- is a member, obviously, of the leadership and was in the meeting today.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I will say, the President said yesterday that the three ideas that he outlined with some specificity don\'t represent the totality of all of what the President would like to see.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this was discussed in that larger meeting, that we need to extend safety nets in terms of unemployment insurance and COBRA extensions.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President discussed increases in both exports as well as continued aid to states and localities.\xc2\xa0 And there may be other targeted ideas that the administration works through between now and even the beginning of the year.</p>\n<p>I think that dialogue will continue, discussing with members of Congress from both parties about how we can best address the situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maxine Waters says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pick up the phone to call members.\xc2\xa0 Does that bother the President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Does it bother the President why?\xc2\xa0 That she said that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it\'s true.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask -- another subject?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The EPA carbon dioxide ruling, some businesses have expressed concerns about what more regulations may mean in terms of jobs.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe in any way that these regulations could have a positive benefit regarding jobs?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\'s no question.\xc2\xa0 First of all, this was a process started not under this EPA but under a previous EPA, based on a Supreme Court decision handed down in 2007 that required the EPA to look into this.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, I think as the President talked about even yesterday, we have an ability through incentivizing a clean energy economy to create the type of demand that\'s necessary to create more and more clean energy jobs.</p>\n<p>Somebody is going to build, as I\'ve said in here before, somebody is going to build the wind turbines that power our homes.\xc2\xa0 Somebody is going to build those solar panels.\xc2\xa0 The only question is who is going to do it.\xc2\xa0 By locating those manufacturing facilities here it can be Americans that build those, rather than having us import them from somewhere else.</p>\n<p>Keith.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the Senate deal, in the past we\'ve had some trouble getting you to say that the President supports a specific policy in the health care debate.\xc2\xa0 Is it correct that he supports that, the policy of that deal--</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In this event the President went right around me and said it himself.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but is this sort of a second-best to the public option?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he did support a public option.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that he\'s willing to accept, or would he rather have had --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not only would he -- I quote the spokesperson who as recently as 45 seconds ago said he supports it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he rather have had a public option --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, you ask me if the President would rather have won the lottery.\xc2\xa0 It\'s an interesting hypothetical that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We do hypotheticals now -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'d disagree with you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not hypothetical, it\'s in the House bill.\xc2\xa0 I mean, does he support that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re making progress.\xc2\xa0 The President supports this process in terms of both good policy and as a way of moving that process forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow, now that the Democratic senators have reached this compromise on the public option, does the President feel that he did everything he could to push specifically for a public option --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- especially since that was his preferred measure of choice and competition?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And he\'s continued to meet with senators in order to make progress.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m following up, too.\xc2\xa0 I read his comments and heard his comments from the community health care thing, but is he saying that he supports this as a vehicle to a conference committee product, or is he saying as a final product that he would support this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, it is hard for me to deign what is going to happen a week from now.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t even tell you what I\'m going to have for dinner.\xc2\xa0 So instead of projecting and predicting the outcome of a conference committee, just quote the President on what he said in terms of supporting both the policy and the moving forward notion in progress.</p>\n<p>But understand, again, sometimes we miss it.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes we focus on the twigs in the forest, not even the trees, to understand that we\'re, again, likely one step closer to seeing comprehensive health care reform that we\'ve had Presidents talk about for 70 years.\xc2\xa0 That\'s important.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Without a public option.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 With increased choice and competition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not saying you approve the Senate over the House version?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not saying you prefer the Senate over the House version.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m just trying to get the bill through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you guys were not in the room when it actually came down, do you feel that -- does the White House feel that it has a clear understanding of what is actually in the Senate deal?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Say again?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House feel that you all have a clear understanding of what\'s in this deal?\xc2\xa0 We\'re waiting to hear from CBO.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to see anything on paper until CBO gets more involved, but do you understand --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think anybody is going to see a full set of details until -- obviously, a series of points have gone to CBO to make some estimates and some predictions on a full range of things, and we certainly will await that, as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your general sense is it -- is what the President saying is he supports in concept the notion of making available to the public something akin to what government employees have an option of?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President certainly talked about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that what this is?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you think --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\'s certainly part of it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, as Jonathan said, there\'s two different -- as I understand it and as I think people here understand it, there\'s two different aspects to it that would increase choice and competition.\xc2\xa0 Obviously one part of that is something akin to what is set up under FEHPB.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is this akin to -- would this turn health care into something like a regulated utility?\xc2\xa0 Is that a good comparison?\xc2\xa0 Is that how much regulation --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d be out of my depth to discuss the -- the truth is I don\'t know enough about the regulation of utilities.</p>\n<p>Bill, and then I\'ll come back.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, again, we don\'t know all the details, but it seems -- not talking about the Medicare part of it, but the other part that you were just discussing with Margaret -- that it offers a choice among another whole set of private insurance plans.\xc2\xa0 So how does that offer the competition that the President was talking about if it\'s just more private insurance plans on top of the 1,300 they already have?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, understand, Bill, that somebody is going to -- there\'s going to be 30-some-million people that will go into -- have access to different plans.\xc2\xa0 The person that puts together the best plan that\'s the most affordable is what people are going to buy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the incentive of a system that allows increased choice and competition.</p>\n<p>I think it\'s clear people will have more choices than they have now; that that competition, as we\'ve talked about in here, will foster progress and costs.\xc2\xa0 As I read I think in the morning papers, there are even incentives -- not incentives, there\'s a mandate for the fact that a certain percentage of money involved in health insurance has to be actually spent on -- can\'t be spent on paperwork.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what drives up a lot of these costs.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that\'s a series of different incentives that will improve the system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the President does call some members of the Congressional Black Caucus.\xc2\xa0 According to the Hill, John Conyers said the President called him, concerned that he had made some demeaning comments about him on a certain radio show.\xc2\xa0 How would you describe the relationship between Congressman Conyers and the President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has respect for Congressman Conyers.\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- I don\'t know the exact word the President used.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believed the criticism was untrue.\xc2\xa0 Suffice to say he reached out and touched someone.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Peter.\xc2\xa0 Only like the older people in the room got that joke.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And I just realized that I\'ve suddenly dated myself with something that a healthy number of people --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re talking about landlines.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know, I know.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\'m trying, you know?</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the issue of jobs in the African American community, obviously the jobless rate among blacks is much more severe than among white Americans.\xc2\xa0 In the President\'s job bill, apart from shoring up the social safety net, is there anything he\'d like to see done, particularly targeted at helping the black community?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think what the President believes is that the plans that he outlined will help white America, black America, Hispanic America, Asian America.\xc2\xa0 Go through the weatherization, the retrofitting alone, we believe that policy like this creates a huge incentive that will increase jobs, that hopefully will begin to provide important training and the development of a skill that is obviously desperately needed not simply to jumpstart an economy, but also to meet our goals for energy efficiency and clean energy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So whether it is the unemployment rate in all of America, whether it\'s the unemployment rate in black America, Hispanic America, or whether it\'s the under-employment rate, the President believes the ideas that he outlined are targeted and responsible in addressing those problems.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Does he have any -- as the first African American President, the President received strong support from the black community.\xc2\xa0 Does he feel any special sense that the black community unemployment rate is something that he wants to make a special focus?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, Peter, I don\'t think the President believes that we should address only one part of the unemployment rate.\xc2\xa0 I think this is a graph that impacts us all.\xc2\xa0 As you mentioned, there\'s a greater number of unemployment African Americans than the national rate.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a greater number of unemployed Hispanic Americans than the national rate.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the plans that he outlined have the ability to address both the national as well as the black and the Hispanic community.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a follow-up on that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll get back to you in a second.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier this year, the President didn\'t seem too thrilled when he had to sign the omnibus for fiscal 2009.\xc2\xa0 Is he at all upset now that the Congress is poised to pass another and has only gone through, I think, five of the 12 individual bills, despite being under total Democratic control?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that we have -- I don\'t know the degree to which the omnibus as it is presently constituted -- let me get some guidance from Legislative Affairs on sort of where we are.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President believed and was hopeful that we could get a budget and a series of appropriations bills on time, and believes we should continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 I think that anybody would say that the process of either omnibus legislation or continuing resolutions that fund the government are not the ideal way to go about doing this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he will sign --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some guidance from Legislative Affairs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on the issue of jobs and the black and brown community -- there\'s some advocacy groups that are wondering if this administration will be working with SBA, because there seems to be a problem -- the federal government is not meeting its goal of minority set-aside procurement contracts. And with that, they say if the federal government were to do that, that would create jobs.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m happy to look at what those statements are and get an answer from folks at SBA on the exact --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Again, on the issue of jobs in the black and brown community -- and the numbers are much higher than the average -- there are unique circumstances to be detailed.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House trying to push more of a green economy -- caulking for cash, and things of that nature?\xc2\xa0 Black and browns are not jumping for these green jobs.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not rushing to get training for this.\xc2\xa0 How is the administration going to afford that, as they\'re trying to balance out unemployment rate in those communities and push this project?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll tell you what he has told people that have asked him this specifically in regards to the African American unemployment rate is what I said in here earlier.\xc2\xa0 Somebody is going to build these wind turbines.\xc2\xa0 Somebody is going to build these solar panels.\xc2\xa0 Somebody is going to be involved in the skills necessary to retrofit individual houses, apartment buildings, businesses, and what have you, in order to make them more efficient.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have to decide as a country that we\'re going to do that\xc2\xa0 -- not import wind turbines, not import solar panels, and not seek somebody else to do the type of skilled retrofitting that\'s necessary to meet our clean energy goals, to save individuals and businesses money on their heating and cooling bills, as well as creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that that is a special challenge that we have and a special challenge that all of us must meet.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:30 P.M.
