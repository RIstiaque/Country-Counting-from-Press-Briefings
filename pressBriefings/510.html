Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p class="p2">12:10 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a sparse crowd.\xc2\xa0 Must be the weather.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s too early is what it is.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s a little early.\xc2\xa0 I have a parent-teacher conference.\xc2\xa0 So I\'ll try to get out by 1:00 p.m.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We like it early.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good, okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, glad to be of assistance.</p>\n<p class="p2">I have no announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 Welcome here on this rainy Monday after what was almost a spring-like weekend -- a little chilly, but we\'ll take it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Julie Pace.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 There have been a lot of developments in Eastern Ukraine over the last 24 hours or so, with pro-Russian separatists seizing an administration building, calling for a referendum that looks similar to the one that happened in Crimea. Does the White House believe that Russia is behind these developments?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a very good question, Julie.\xc2\xa0 We\'re concerned about several escalatory moves in Ukraine over the weekend and we see those as a result of increased Russian pressure on Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 As you noted, we saw groups of pro-Russian demonstrators take over government buildings in the Eastern cities of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk.\xc2\xa0 And there is strong evidence suggesting some of these demonstrators were paid and were not local residents.</p>\n<p class="p2">In Donetsk, a handful of pro-Russian separatists in the barricaded Donetsk oblast government administration declared the creation of the \xe2\x80\x9cDonetsk People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic,\xe2\x80\x9d announced a so-called referendum on May 11 seeking to join Russia, and requested Russia send in military peacekeepers.\xc2\xa0 These people lack the legal authority to make any of those decisions.</p>\n<p class="p2">If Russia moves into Eastern Ukraine, either overtly or covertly, this would be a very serious escalation.\xc2\xa0 We call on President Putin and his government to cease all efforts to destabilize Ukraine and we caution against further military intervention.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say that some of these people were paid and were not local residents, do you think that they were being paid by Russia?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we can divine from the strong evidence that some demonstrators were paid and that they were not local residents, and I think that at least suggests that outside forces, not local forces, were participating in the effort to create these provocations.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not going to --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you mean by outside forces, Russian forces?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we can say -- what\xe2\x80\x99s clear is this is a result of increased Russian pressure on Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And we see it in the troops that have massed on the border.\xc2\xa0 We see it in a variety of developments internally within Ukraine in the regions of the country where there are more ethnic Russians in some of the concerns expressed about the fate of ethnic Russians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this along throughout this crisis out of Moscow where there have been discussions or assertions about ethnic Russians being mistreated, and certainly at the time when that first started, there were statements to that effect that bore no resemblance to the actual truth at the time.</p>\n<p class="p3">So all of this is of concern to us, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear that should Russia take action that violates Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity further, or violates Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty further, there will be further consequences.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President signed two executive orders, and the second one creates authorities that would allow the United States to level more additional sanctions aimed at sectors of the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 Our partners in Europe and elsewhere have indicated a likeminded approach should there be further troubles.</p>\n<p class="p2">Now, I say that, but I want to remind you that we are continuing to push for a diplomatic resolution to this matter, a de-escalation of the crisis.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with -- or at least engaged in conversations with Russia and others about the need to have a dialogue between the Russian and Ukrainian governments that can be joined by international partners, the need for Russia to pull its forces back to its bases and to the levels that existed prior to the crisis, and for a series of other steps that need to be taken so that this situation does not escalate.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you received any concrete signs from the Russians since the Kerry-Lavrov meeting that they are actually interested in a diplomatic solution?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we continue to be engaged with Russia in discussions, including at the level of Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov.\xc2\xa0 We also are engaging with our European Union partners and others, and importantly, directly with the government of Ukraine on these issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And I wanted to take this opportunity to applaud the steps that Ukraine has taken to continue disarming and reintegrating irregular forces, including parliament\xe2\x80\x99s action to order law enforcement agencies to disarm immediately these groups.\xc2\xa0 And that I think reflects the fact that the government in Ukraine has been handling this very difficult situation responsibly, and that has certainly not been the case with the government of Russia.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I can just ask quickly -- the White House and State Department both said at the end of last week that the President and Secretary Kerry would have a meeting to discuss the future of the U.S. role in Mideast peace talks.\xc2\xa0 Has that meeting taken place yet?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any meetings involving the President to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President and Secretary Kerry are in regular contact about that issue, Middle East peace, as well as the many others that confront us around the globe, including the situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, Secretary Kerry has a standing meeting with the President, and I assume that that will be one of many topics that they discuss when that meeting takes place.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Russians had talked of pulling back some forces in Eastern Ukraine, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Has that happened?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no update on our view of that, and I think that our last statement regarding those reports was that we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen any evidence to suggest that there had been an actual pullback of forces.\xc2\xa0 And I think General Breedlove had said that.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And basically what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in Eastern Ukraine, do you see this as a repeat of the Crimea scenario?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think circumstances are obviously different in the regions that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, but we do see developments that are of concern, as I just noted, in Donetsk and Kharkiv and Luhansk, other areas of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And we note the presence of a significant number of Russian troops on the border, as has been the case now for some time.\xc2\xa0 And we monitor those developments and we have warned Russia against further intervention in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 In order to resolve and deescalate the situation, Russia needs to move those troops back from the border region and to begin negotiations directly with the Ukrainian government.\xc2\xa0 As I noted before, we are prepared to impose further sanctions on sectors of the Russian economy should the situation escalate.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are those sanctions ready to go, ready to announce as soon as you detect some movement?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to delve too deeply into the process, but you can be sure that when the President signs an executive order of the kind that he signed, the second one -- which deals with the potential for sanctions on sectors of the economy -- that a certain amount of work goes into preparing that executive order, and work continues should the authorities contained within it be employed.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, Jay -- sorry -- now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve hit the 7 million mark on Obamacare, will this allow the President to have more time to push his policies -- equal pay, minimum wage -- be able to promote those policies more?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the way I would answer that is to say that the effort underway since October 1st -- from October 1st to March 31st, and particularly in the wake of the troubled rollout of the website, while enormously distracting for a lot of folks and something that required a lot of attention so that we could get it right, even then did not prevent the President from focusing on his number-one objective, which is to take action wherever possible, with Congress when possible, using his executive authority or his convening power when necessary, to expand opportunity for Americans around the country; to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re putting in place policies that reward hard work and responsibility.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing that, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue doing that.\xc2\xa0 You know he\xe2\x80\x99s got an event tomorrow on equal pay.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to take action using his executive authority in that arena, even as he calls on Congress to do what it should, which is to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.</p>\n<p class="p3">So, look, I think that, as we noted last week, that was an important milestone and we were all gratified at the extraordinary work that went into hitting the 7 million signup mark.\xc2\xa0 And that number has only increased since then as those who were already in line, who had begun the process of signing up but weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to finish it by March 31st continue to sign up.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s all to the good.\xc2\xa0 But the President is going to be focused on what he was focused on in the past, which is expanding opportunity and rewarding hard work.</p>\n<p class="p2">Michelle.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Putin was warned before they took action in Crimea.\xc2\xa0 So the warnings that everyone issues now and the fact that we already have sanctions in place, do you think that there\xe2\x80\x99s any evidence that what has been done already towards Russia is a deterrent to them doing anything further?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to prove a negative.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, they\xe2\x80\x99ve had troops on the border in Ukraine --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, based on the conversations that have happened.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve had troops on the border in Ukraine for some time.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t be sure about Russian motivations.\xc2\xa0 We are concerned about the presence of those troops.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about developments within Eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, as you noted, that further transgressions by Russia will be met with and responded to by further sanctions, including in the areas outline in the executive order the President signed.</p>\n<p class="p2">So there are costs associated with the actions that Russia has taken already, and there could be further costs coming as a result of the actions that Russia has already taken.\xc2\xa0 And there will certainly be more costs if Russia takes further action.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But even in that last conversation between the President and Putin, did Putin reiterate that they have no further designs on Ukraine?\xc2\xa0 And also, he was supposed to put something in writing if he wanted to go further with discussion. Did that ever happen?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the first question, we\xe2\x80\x99ve read out in some detail the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with President Putin.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to public statements by Russian officials and note that whatever is being said by Russian officials is not something we consider the last word.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously looking at Russian actions, and that includes actions on the border, actions within Ukraine.</p>\n<p class="p2">On the question of the so-called U.S. proposal that the two Presidents spoke about a week ago Friday, without getting into detail, Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov continue to discuss how to deescalate the situation.\xc2\xa0 And the U.S. is fully prepared -- or rather fully coordinated with the Ukrainian government on these discussions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But within the context of these conversations, as you know, the general elements of an off-ramp that we have proposed include international monitors, a pulling back of Russian forces, and direct Russia-Ukraine dialogue, supported by the international community, as the Ukrainian government proceeds towards constitutional reform efforts and prepared for elections on May 25th.</p>\n<p class="p2">Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to note the responsible approach that the Ukrainian government has taken in these last weeks, despite the enormous pressure they\xe2\x80\x99ve been under because of the situation precipitated by Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions in Crimea and elsewhere.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we can\'t really say if they\xe2\x80\x99ve put something in writing since --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, there have been conversations.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go into detail about the way they\xe2\x80\x99ve communicated.\xc2\xa0 But Russian officials understand what we have proposed very clearly, and we have been in discussions about our proposal, supported by our partners, for deescalation.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly hope that those conversations produce a decision by Russia to deescalate.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jon.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, we just passed the anniversary of the start of the Rwandan genocide, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s any -- even your own analysis, this anniversary comes as we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen unfold in Syria, another mass humanitarian crisis, mass killing, more than 2 million displaced people.\xc2\xa0 Are we looking again at another \xe2\x80\x9cnever again\xe2\x80\x9d moment?\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern within the White House not that the United States necessarily could have stopped what\xe2\x80\x99s happened there, but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly been a failure on the part of the world community to stop yet another mass killing that is approaching the magnitude of what we saw in Rwanda?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I thank you for the question.\xc2\xa0 Let me say a couple of things about Rwanda, and then I will address the question about Syria.\xc2\xa0 You saw the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said, we join with the people of Rwanda in marking 20 years since the beginning of the genocide that took the lives of so many innocents and which shook the conscience of the world.\xc2\xa0 At this moment of reflection, we also remember that the Rwandan genocide was neither and accident, nor unavoidable.\xc2\xa0 It was a deliberate and systematic effort by human beings to destroy other human beings.\xc2\xa0 The world\xe2\x80\x99s failure to respond more quickly reminds us that we always have a choice.</p>\n<p class="p2">The President believes and the United States believes that in the face of hatred, intolerance, and suffering, we must never be indifferent.\xc2\xa0 We must remember the humanity we share and work together as an international community to prevent atrocities and to bring an end to genocide once and for all.</p>\n<p class="p2">On the question of Syria, we remain deeply committed to the Syrian people and are assisting those affected by the violence through our approximately $1.7 billion now in humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve consistently said that those responsible for atrocities in Syria must be held accountable.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve supported the U.N. Commission of Inquiry and other institutions helping document atrocities and build the foundation for transitional justice.</p>\n<p class="p2">We are helping Syria\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors, Libya -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq cope with the spillover from the conflict, and we are coordinating with partners to counter the threat of extremism.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to push for the elimination of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons, in coordination with the United Nations and OPCW.\xc2\xa0 We are continuing to look at what more we can do to end the conflict and ease the suffering of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">I think that the United States, this administration have -- we have acted aggressively in supporting the Syrian people, in assisting the opposition, in working with our partners to try to put pressure on the Assad regime, a regime that has committed unspeakable atrocities.\xc2\xa0 We have taken the case with our partners to the United Nations repeatedly.\xc2\xa0 We have been blocked by Russia at the United Nations Security Council, and I think the fact that you can number Assad\xe2\x80\x99s friends on one hand demonstrates that the world community has elevated what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Syria so that everyone understands the appalling nature of the regime and the need for the world to act.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to press in every way we can to assist the Syrian people.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you may think you\xe2\x80\x99ve acted aggressively, as you said, but you can\'t think that the efforts of the United States have been successful here, or the world community.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, certainly the war continues.\xc2\xa0 The killing continues.\xc2\xa0 What we are constantly doing is reviewing and assessing what else we can do.\xc2\xa0 These kinds of discussions when bad things continue to happen in a place like Syria, always can be reduced to the question of, is the United States going to use its military forces to try to do something?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the only question, though, right?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And we may -- well, but I\xe2\x80\x99m getting there for you in a way, and I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that we assess all options and we make decisions based on what we believe is the right course of action to take in support of the Syrian people and in support of our national security interests.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a quick question on the issue of equal pay.\xc2\xa0 The President has cited a figure of women making 77 cents on the dollar compared to men.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at the -- a couple people have looked at White House salaries.\xc2\xa0 There was an AEI study that said the median salaries in the White House, women make 88 percent of what men make.\xc2\xa0 And I think PolitiFact had a similar study back during the campaign.\xc2\xa0 How do you explain what appears to be a wage gap here at the White House?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say a couple of things about this.\xc2\xa0 We know that closing the gender wage gap is a key part of our economic agenda, women\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.\xc2\xa0 And here at the White House equal pay legislation deems that there should be equal pay for equal work, and that\'s what we have -- men and women in equivalent roles here earn equivalent salaries.</p>\n<p class="p2">For example, we have two deputy chiefs of staff, one man and one woman, and they earn the same salary.\xc2\xa0 We have 16 department heads, over half of them are women, all of whom make the same salary as their male counterparts.</p>\n<p class="p2">And I think that it is worth noting, as anyone who participates in our senior staff meetings can see, that we have here in the White House over half the women -- over half the staff are women and fulfilling key senior leadership roles across the board, including Deputy Chief of Staff Alyssa Mastromonaco, Counterterrorism Adviser Lisa Monaco,\xc2\xa0 National Security Advisor Susan Rice, White House Counsel Kathy Ruemmler, Senior Adviser to the President Valerie Jarrett, Direct of Domestic Policy Cecilia Mu\xc3\xb1oz, Director Communications Jennifer Palmieri, Director of Legislative Affairs Katie Beirne Fallon, Director of Scheduling Danielle Crutchfield, and Director of Management Administration Katie Kale.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And what that tells you is the President has enormously qualified people in the most senior spots in the White House and they\'re --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why is that the median salary of women in the White House is 88 percent of men then?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that those studies look at the aggregate of everyone on staff, and that includes from the most junior levels to the most senior.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that we have -- as an institution here -- have aggressively addressed this challenge.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, though, at the 88 cents that you cite, that is not 100, but it is better than the national average.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to the bottom line that women who do the same work as men have to be paid the same, there is no question that that is happening here at the White House at every level.</p>\n<p class="p2">Bill.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You made the point earlier that the administration is prepared to impose further sanctions on Russia -- sector sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Do you have buy-in from the Europeans?\xc2\xa0 Because sector sanctions will hurt both their economy and that of the U.S.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As the President noted when he spoke on the morning that he signed that second executive order, imposing those sanctions on the Russian economy and sectors of it would not be our preferred course because there would be harm done to the U.S. economy, to the global economy, to the European economy, but it would be necessary to do so if Russia engaged in further transgressions against Ukraine.</p>\n<p class="p2">What you saw when the President visited Europe and had meetings with our closest allies in Europe was just what you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked about, which was a buy-in, if you will, a consensus among our European allies that this would be the next step that would have to be taken if the Russians engaged in further transgressions.</p>\n<p class="p2">So, obviously I\'m not going to speak for the European Union or individual European countries, but I would point you to what European leaders said while the President was in the Netherlands and in Belgium, and note that from Chancellor Merkel to Prime Minister Cameron to leader after leader in Europe, you have seen very strong statements about what Russia has done and very firm commitments to holding Russia accountable for the transgressions that have already occurred and for any potential further transgressions.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given the reporting that we\'ve seen since the European meetings, there seems to be a discrepancy between what Russia -- what Europe would sanction and what we would call -- or what would cause us to sanction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not sure of the reporting that you refer to.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we have been working very closely with our European partners, as well as Japan, as part of the G7 meeting, on this issue and feel that we\'ve achieved a very strong, joint commitment when it comes to how to respond and how to act should Russia engage in further transgressions.</p>\n<p class="p2">Ed.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on Jon\xe2\x80\x99s question about pay equity.\xc2\xa0 So you\'re basically saying that women at the senior levels here make equal or more than men, but if you\'re at the lower level and you\'re a woman on the White House staff, you don\'t make as much?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, that would be a misreading and misinterpretation of what I said.\xc2\xa0 Everybody at every level here at the White House is paid the same for the same work, male or female.\xc2\xa0 And that is reflected at the most senior levels here where half or more than half of the department heads are women; some of the most senior positions in the White House are filled by women, including National Security Advisor, Homeland Security Advisor, White House Counsel, Communications Director, Senior Advisor, Deputy Chief of Staff.\xc2\xa0 It goes on and on.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how do we get to the 88 cents?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I just explained that, but I\'ll do it for you as well, and that is that when you look at the aggregate -- and this includes everybody from the most senior levels to the lowest levels -- you\'re averaging all salaries together, which means including the lowest-level salaries, which may or may not be, depending on the institution, filled by more women than men.\xc2\xa0 But at every level here at the White House you\'re paid the same for the work that you do regardless of your gender.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But couldn\'t federal contractors, some of them say that that\'s what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing as well but the numbers are off because of what you just stated?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The equal pay issue, Ed -- and I\'m glad you\'re taking an interest in it -- is focused on ensuring that, for example, Lilly Ledbetter was in a circumstance where she had no idea that she was being paid less than men who were doing the same work until she was informed well after the fact through an anonymous tip.\xc2\xa0 And the legislation the President signed in his first week in office addressed that issue.\xc2\xa0 The actions he\xe2\x80\x99s going to take tomorrow, using his executive authority, address those issues, and they have to do with making sure that women are not discriminated against when they\xe2\x80\x99re doing the same job and being paid less for it.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And Senator Reid is going to have a vote tomorrow, I believe, on this issue, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is putting out what they\xe2\x80\x99re calling a GOP pay gap and saying that there are Republican senators who are preventing women from making the same amount as men.\xc2\xa0 A couple weeks ago when I asked you about this issue and asked you if midterm election-year politics had anything to do with this you said you were offended at that question, that politics had nothing to do with this.\xc2\xa0 With the DSCC pushing this issue in that way, do you still stand behind the idea this is not a political issue?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s like saying the DSCC pushing the minimum wage or pushing any agenda item that they believe is important policy is about the midterm elections.\xc2\xa0 I would remind you that the President of the United States, the first law he signed, first bill he signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter bill.\xc2\xa0 That was a long time from any election.\xc2\xa0 So the actions the President is taking this week, the action that he supports that the Democratic senator is taking reflect a commitment that he\xe2\x80\x99s held and proven his interest in from the very beginning of his time in office.</p>\n<p class="p2">Peter.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on immigration, we heard from former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, who said something -- I\'m curious to get some of the White House\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts on this.\xc2\xa0 He basically said that those people who come to the country illegally do so because they have no other means to provide for their family.\xc2\xa0 And he said what they did is \xe2\x80\x9cnot a felony.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s an act of love. It\'s an act of commitment to your family.\xc2\xa0 I honestly think that\'s a different kind of crime.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the White House view that as a different kind of crime?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see former Governor Bush\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.\xc2\xa0 It\'s clearly the case that -- and I\'ve heard former President Bush talk about this, too, and as you know former President George W. Bush was a firm supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And he would say -- and I would note this -- I remember in the 2000 campaign, which I covered, that he would stand before rock-ribbed Republican audiences and talk about how family values don\'t stop at the Rio Grande.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what former Governor Jeb Bush is talking about.\xc2\xa0 And certainly the President would agree with that -- which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we\xe2\x80\x99re not a nation of laws and that we don\'t need to enforce our border security, which we do, and this President is obviously committed to that.\xc2\xa0 But we need to reform our immigration system. It\xe2\x80\x99s broken.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And I believe both former President Bush, former Governor Bush support comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And that reflects a broad consensus across the country that exists.\xc2\xa0 Senator John McCain -- sponsor of comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 That consensus exists.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s not ideological, it\'s not partisan -- it\'s got Democratic support and Republican support, and big-business support and labor support, support from evangelical communities, support from law enforcement communities.</p>\n<p class="p3">And the reason why there is this consensus is because the need is so clear and the benefits of comprehensive immigration reform are so clear to our economy, to our security, to our capacity to innovate, and also to ensure that we\'re showing the kind of compassion when it comes to some of these issues that the President talked about recently.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess then, does that desire to have that sense of compassion, or your answer there gel with -- The New York Times put out an analysis today saying that internal government records show that since President Obama took office, nearly two-thirds --or two-thirds of nearly 2 million deportation cases involved people who had committed only minor infractions.\xc2\xa0 They note traffic violations, no criminal record at all.\xc2\xa0 Do those two gel?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 Ninety-eight percent of ICE\xe2\x80\x99s total removals last year met one or more of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s civil immigration enforcement priorities.\xc2\xa0 Other than convicted criminals, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s priorities include those apprehended while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States, illegal reentrance -- individuals who return to the U.S. after being previously removed by ICE; and fugitives from immigration court.</p>\n<p class="p3">It\'s important to note that 82 percent of the individuals removed from the interior of the U.S. were previously convicted of a criminal offense, and 72 percent of these individuals were convicted of an ICE level 1 or level 2 offense.\xc2\xa0 These individuals we\'re convicted of aggravated felonies, other felony offenses, or three or more misdemeanors.</p>\n<p class="p3">Additionally, 93 percent of all of ICE\xe2\x80\x99s non-criminal removals were recent border crossers, repeat immigration violators, or fugitives from immigration court.\xc2\xa0 It\'s important to remember that under U.S. law it is a felony to attempt to reenter after being removed, so those individuals fall into one of ICE\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement priorities.\xc2\xa0 And I think that points out one of the challenges here and one of the reasons why we need to reform our system comprehensively.\xc2\xa0 Because, as the President has made clear, he remains deeply concerned about the pain too many families feel from the separation that comes from our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And the President has directed Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to do an inventory of the department\xe2\x80\x99s current practices to see how the department can conduct enforcement more humanely within the confines of the law.</p>\n<p class="p3">So you have the facts before you, which is that we have, when it comes to enforcement prioritization, taken steps to make sure that in this case, 82 percent of the individuals removed from the interior were previously convicted of a criminal offense; 93 percent of all of these non-criminal removals were recent border crossers and repeat immigration violators.\xc2\xa0 And yet there is still this issue of the pain of separation and the need to take action.</p>\n<p class="p3">That\'s why we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform. That\'s why it would be such a good thing for the House of Representatives, for Speaker Boehner and Republican leaders Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy to listen to the voices out in the country calling for comprehensive immigration reform, listen to the business leaders calling for it, across the country calling for it, to the law enforcement leaders calling for it.\xc2\xa0 Listen to the economists who talk about the boon immigration reform would provide to our GDP, to deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 Listen to those who argue about how important it is to ensure that all of our employers across the country are playing by the same rules.\xc2\xa0 Listen to those out in Silicon Valley and elsewhere who are enormously concerned about the need to keep talent that comes to the United States, individuals who come and study here in fields like engineering and computer science, to let them stay here so that they can build businesses here and the United States can continue to be the leader in these high-tech fields that are so valuable to our economic growth.</p>\n<p class="p3">So there are just so many great reasons to pass this.\xc2\xa0 There are so many conservative reasons to pass this.\xc2\xa0 And the President sincerely hopes that Republicans in the House hear those voices, hear those conservative arguments as well as the humane arguments -- not that those are contradictory necessarily -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even get a laugh out of that?\xc2\xa0 And then take action.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quickly, tonight in Dallas, the NCAA National Championship game will be held.\xc2\xa0 You can give me the President\xe2\x80\x99s pics -- UConn -- invited him on to the bandwagon -- versus Kentucky.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Like so many of us, his picks washed out in the brackets.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So UConn invited him on to the bandwagon -- now is the time to get on.\xc2\xa0 But I want to ask you more seriously, though, about the University of Kentucky, which starts five freshmen as part of what\xe2\x80\x99s the one-and-done rule.\xc2\xa0 A lot of people think that\xe2\x80\x99s no way to run a university athletics program or it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad tradition that\xe2\x80\x99s being created in college sports.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of schools inviting kids in basically for one season in an effort to groom them for the pros, as opposed to for the academic opportunities that it\xe2\x80\x99s intended for?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I confess, Peter, that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that conversation with him.\xc2\xa0 I know the President has addressed questions like this in some of the interviews he\xe2\x80\x99s done with ESPN and other outlets on issues related to sports and academics within sports.\xc2\xa0 I know the President believes firmly that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for our student athletes to get an education, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific response from him on the question of Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s freshmen.</p>\n<p class="p3">Carol.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said in answering Jon\xe2\x80\x99s question that the wage gap between men and women in the White House is better than the national average.\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s just based on the data that Jon told me.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say that, do you mean that that\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for the White House?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there still work to be done in this regard?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s work -- there\xe2\x80\x99s work to be done across the country and we need to engage in that.\xc2\xa0 I think that on the fundamental issue of do employers pay women equally for the same work, the White House record is crystal clear and the answer is yes.\xc2\xa0 And not only that, but I think on a separate but related matter, when it comes to ensuring that there are women in senior positions, the White House can point to the very senior women on the staff here in positions ranging from White House Counsel to communications to national security and note that the President has enormously qualified individuals in those positions who happen to be women.</p>\n<p class="p3">But the broader issue is one that we all as a nation have to address and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is committed to it.\xc2\xa0 The focus, obviously, of the Paycheck Fairness Act and the equal pay-related executive actions that the President wants to take is to ensure that women are not being paid less for the work that they do -- the same work that men do.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And very quickly on Ukraine, just to clarify -- you said that any intervention in Eastern Ukraine either overtly or covertly by Russia would be a serious escalation of the crisis, which would elicit these sector sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And you also said that the U.S. blames the current unrest on increased Russian pressure in the area and there\xe2\x80\x99s strong evidence that these protestors have been paid.\xc2\xa0 So given all of those facts, is it fair to say that these developments meet the threshold for the U.S. imposing sanctions?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that, if you look closely at how I answered the question, that we would consider Russia moves into Eastern Ukraine both overt and covert to be a serious escalation. We have the authorities already to impose further sanctions, and the President and his team will continue to assess Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions and whether or not to impose those further sanctions.\xc2\xa0 We also have the authorities to impose further sanctions for the transgressions already made by Russia when it comes to Crimea.</p>\n<p class="p3">So we are concerned about this.\xc2\xa0 We have seen evidence, strong evidence that some of the demonstrators were paid, as I said, and were not local residents.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to monitor developments on the border and the positioning and disposition of Russian troops on the border, and that is a concern.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not announcing new sanctions.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we have the authorities [that] are there.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get a sense of is whether when you guys talk about any increased action by Russia, that that would elicit these new sanctions that the President signed the executive order to have the authority to do.\xc2\xa0 Does what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last 24 hours meet the threshold for imposing those new sanctions?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking whether or not you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that, but would this particular action be enough to elicit those sanctions?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that is a way of asking that question so what I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is that we are concerned about what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to monitor developments there to make clear to Russia that there will be costs for further transgressions, violations of Ukraine\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity, even as we engage with Russia in an effort to encourage Russia to deescalate the situation and to pursue a diplomatic resolution to the crisis.</p>\n<p class="p3">Stephen.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say that there\xe2\x80\x99s strong evidence of outsiders being involved, is that a way of saying that you believe the Russian covert services are using a tactic they\xe2\x80\x99ve used before of paying outsiders and bringing them in to incite incidents?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I would say is that there is evidence that some of the demonstrators are not local, that some of them were paid.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to peel back the onion any further, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen strong evidence of that and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been some evidence of that nature that\xe2\x80\x99s been reported on in the press.\xc2\xa0 And this is a matter of serious concern.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to parse it further than that except to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re -- the kinds of things that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in Ukraine are the kinds of things that are of concern to us -- the potential that there might be incidents provoked that create a pretext for other kind of action, certainly developments that are not unprecedented in this kind of history.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re watching very closely.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can just ask about the Afghan elections over<span class="s1">*</span> the weekend.\xc2\xa0 Does the evidence so far -- I know the results sort of take a while to come in -- suggest that the candidate that emerges from this process is going to look for a less contentious relationship with the U.S. than President Karzai?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the best way to answer that question is to say that, first of all, we commend the millions of Afghan men and women who went to the polls on April 5.\xc2\xa0 And the campaign period over the past two months was full of open and responsible debate among the candidates and the Afghan people turned out in force to choose the direction of their country.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s important about this process is that it was and continues to be Afghan owned.\xc2\xa0 The Afghan people secured this election, they ran this election, and most importantly, they voted in this election.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important milestone.</p>\n<p class="p3">Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re still early in the process.\xc2\xa0 The results will take some time to be tabulated and our perspective is simply that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a preferred candidate because the future of Afghanistan is up to the Afghans to decide.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to a productive relationship with President Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s successor, whomever that may be.</p>\n<p class="p3">April.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two topics.\xc2\xa0 Going back to something Jonathon asked on Rwanda and Syria, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the President and this administration is constantly reviewing and assessing facts on the ground, what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Syria.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, understanding that Former President Bill Clinton, when he left office, said he had regrets about not moving into Rwanda faster and sooner -- he could have saved, he thought, at least a third of those who were killed in the genocides there -- are there any regrets as you\xe2\x80\x99re going through the reviewing and assessments of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Syria?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I would say a couple of things on the comparative, which is that from the moment the Assad regime began slaughtering its own people, we spoke forcefully and clearly in opposition to that and we began mobilizing an international response in terms of aid to the Syrian people and actions to isolate the Assad regime and to help build up an opposition that emerged obviously from scratch.</p>\n<p class="p3">So I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that while the tragedy continues to unfold there, the fact of the assault on the Syrian people was one that this country and others responded to and acted on quickly.</p>\n<p class="p3">There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that it continues to be a terrible situation and that we continue to evaluate what we can do and what we can do with our partners to further isolate Assad, further put pressure on him.\xc2\xa0 We continue to implore the Russians to reconsider their support for this horrendous tyrant.\xc2\xa0 They have continually blocked action by the United Nations Security Council because of their support for Assad.\xc2\xa0 And we think obviously history is not on the side of Assad or the side of Assad\xe2\x80\x99s protectors.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So, again, when you talk about moving more forcefully in the comparative, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had discussions here and the President has talked about considerations he has made when it comes to at least the suggestion that the U.S. ought to move in, in varying degrees, militarily in Syria and he has deemed those not to be the right courses of action when it comes to improving the situation in Syria and enhancing our national security.</p>\n<p class="p3">So this remains a very difficult challenge for the United States and for the international community, and we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to work with our partners on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the next issue, the selfie issue.\xc2\xa0 How far-reaching will this ban go or has there been a determination that there will be a ban officially on selfies with the President?\xc2\xa0 And what have been the conversations with Samsung and David Ortiz himself?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no discussion of a ban.\xc2\xa0 I think that was --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s Dan Pfeiffer from yesterday.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He was saying, I think humorously that the end of all selfies -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he just meant the White House.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this a nationwide ban on selfies?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to use our executive authority to\xc2\xa0 -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p3">No, look, we have a standing approach to issues like this when the President\xe2\x80\x99s image is used for commercial purposes.\xc2\xa0 I think Dan spoke yesterday about the fact that White House Counsel had been in communication with her counterpart at Samsung.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details on that but we believe this issue will be resolved and we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the same approach on this matter as we have when we\xe2\x80\x99ve had similar incidents or cases when the President\xe2\x80\x99s image has been used for commercial purposes.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How far reaching is this going to go?\xc2\xa0 Are you just talking to Samsung?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s office reaching out to David Ortiz to find out more?\xc2\xa0 Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you talk about it?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I am talking about it.\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99re not reaching out.\xc2\xa0 I am talking about it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying we talked to Samsung and that\xe2\x80\x99s the sum total of the action with regards to this particular incident.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the President feel about this?\xc2\xa0 Did he feel bad about being duped in the selfie?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about that.\xc2\xa0 I have I think told some of you that the President obviously didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that there was a Samsung play here, if you will.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not treating this any differently than we did in the past when there was a matter concerning the use of the President\xe2\x80\x99s likeness for commercial purposes.</p>\n<p class="p3">I think I promised you and then I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to run to a very important meeting.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s current view on the outlook for the Israeli-Palestinian talks, given the reception that Secretary Kerry received on his last trip with everyone and the long-term analysis you all have?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met last night to discuss ways to overcome the crisis in the talks.\xc2\xa0 The meeting was serious, it was constructive, and both sides agreed to reconvene today to continue the effort.</p>\n<p class="p3">The issue now is whether the parties can demonstrate that they are willing to make the difficult decisions necessary to move the process forward.\xc2\xa0 The parties understand what the choices are and they understand that these are not decisions that the United States or any other country can make.\xc2\xa0 The parties themselves have to make them.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously played a role, an important role in trying to facilitate these negotiations, these discussions, but ultimately the decisions that have to be made need to be made by the parties themselves, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to engage in whatever way we can to try to facilitate this.\xc2\xa0 But as I think others have said, this issue hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone unsolved for so long because it\xe2\x80\x99s easy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s precisely because it\xe2\x80\x99s so difficult that it has resisted a resolution for many, many years and resisted the sincere efforts of administrations of both parties over these many years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But the fact that these challenges are so intractable doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t try.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it means you\xe2\x80\x99re obligated, as the United States of America, to try, even if the odds are ever long.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re always going to be long in this situation, but not impossible.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we engage.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do they seem a little longer now?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I never would put odds.\xc2\xa0 I would say that the sides continue to talk.\xc2\xa0 We continue to participate in a way that we hope helps facilitate progress.\xc2\xa0 And beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Mickey Rooney -- do you guys have a statement, or anything on Mickey Rooney, on the passing? \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Certainly a titan of the industry, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a -- and certainly our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything beyond that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Thank you.</p>\n<p class="p2">END<br/>\n\t1:04 P.M.
