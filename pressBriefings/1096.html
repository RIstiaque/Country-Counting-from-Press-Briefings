EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you guys came out on casual Friday today.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we thought we\xe2\x80\x99d do this a little early today so that we could expedite your weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay had a couple of meetings with the President this morning, so he suggested that I mind the store, and he promised that you would all be nice to me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll be evaluating that proposition over the course of the next 20 minutes or so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll try and jump around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do this gaggle-style, so hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll just -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll move around here relatively quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Ben, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go ahead and start.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions about -- (laughter) --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Old habits die hard.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did I say Jay?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Next time you can call me Robert.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Or Dana, I guess.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re on a roll, West Wing weekend.\xc2\xa0 So yesterday the President said over the coming weeks he\xe2\x80\x99ll be rolling out jobs proposals week by week.\xc2\xa0 Can we expect to see any of these in August?\xc2\xa0 For example, next week on the bus tour?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get out of -- ahead out of what the President will do on the bus tour.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the bus tour is an opportunity for him to travel through three states in the Midwest, to get outside of Washington, D.C., which he\xe2\x80\x99s not had the opportunity to do very often over the last several weeks, and hear from Americans in local communities about how the difficult economic recovery has impacted them in their community and their businesses.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific to preview for you now about what he might say next week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or about the timing of these --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And he also said that there are some in Congress right now who would rather see their opponents lose than see America win.\xc2\xa0 Pretty damning statement there.\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s he talking about?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the frustration that the President articulated yesterday in Michigan was frustration that you had seen him articulate several times over the last month or so. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the President was frustrated that there were a small number of people in Congress who were willing to put their party ahead of country.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that he was profoundly frustrated by.\xc2\xa0 It is something that has had a -- clearly has had an impact on the economy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that he was not pleased by.\xc2\xa0 I think he even described it yesterday as a self-inflicted wound.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the -- that\xe2\x80\x99s something that he hopes -- I guess I should say it this way:\xc2\xa0 I think that he views that as something that the American people are pretty frustrated by, or at least the vast majority of the American people are frustrated by, and he\xe2\x80\x99s hopeful that we can bring about a change in tone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow a little bit on that.\xc2\xa0 So when he rolls out his ideas, does he mean specifically that every week there will be ideas, or was he speaking more broadly that over the next several weeks he\xe2\x80\x99ll be rolling out ideas?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that he was speaking more broadly.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he was committing to a 9:30 a.m. Monday morning announcement for the next several weeks.\xc2\xa0 But rather I do think that he was talking about -- and Jay mentioned this from the podium here earlier this week -- that there are a number of things that the American people expect of their President in these difficult economic times.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, that is continuing to advocate for policies that have bipartisan support that could be beneficial to the economy right now.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, that involves interacting with policymakers and talking about the economy.\xc2\xa0 It certainly involves talking to his counterparts in other countries, the leaders of other countries, about the international impact of the recent volatility we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But another of those things is offering up even more ideas and continually being on the hunt for the kinds of ideas that will create jobs and strengthen our economy moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- this falls pretty cleanly in line with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, the meeting with the CEOs, can you just tell us how many?\xc2\xa0 Any names? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have names later this afternoon, but I can tell you that the meeting that the President is having today is similar to the meetings that he\xe2\x80\x99s had pretty regularly over the last -- frankly, since he took office two and a half years ago -- because he does view this as an opportunity to talk to these business leaders, to these leaders in the private sector, who will ultimately be the venue where our economic recovery is driven; that he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to them about how the -- about how the economic challenges are affecting their individual companies, but also their broader sectors; and that this is an opportunity for that dialogue to take place.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President looking forward to Tim Pawlenty mowing Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s lawn?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Or maybe your lawn?\xc2\xa0 If you could spell out for him the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I live in a condo, so it might be a little awkward.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that I caught a little bit of the debate yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I understand that the President did not have the opportunity to watch the debate last night.\xc2\xa0 I have not had a chance to talk to him about it yet this morning.\xc2\xa0 I do anticipate that he\xe2\x80\x99s read some of the news coverage, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is the sense here at the White House about it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, one thing Jay set up as a marker on the gaggle yesterday was that you\xe2\x80\x99d be looking -- the White House generally would be looking to see if Republicans have any new ideas, if they\xe2\x80\x99re not -- in his words -- \xe2\x80\x9cretreads\xe2\x80\x9d of old economic job plans.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your sense?\xc2\xa0 I mean, were there new ideas?\xc2\xa0 Are there things the President might take seriously?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, one of the things that I was struck by, and there were others at the White House who were struck by this, that the -- was the moment when they were asked about whether -- these candidates were asked about whether they would consider a proposal on a 10 to 1 ratio in terms of $10 in spending cuts for every dollar in revenue increases, and all of them raised their hands indicating they would not even consider a proposal like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that I think indicates that -- well, let me say it this way, the American people -- that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly not where the American people are.\xc2\xa0 That is a position that would require -- that basically puts these candidates in a position of not even asking corporate jet owners to assume one-tenth of the burden that we\xe2\x80\x99re asking college students to bear; that middle-class families -- that they would not even consider asking millionaires and billionaires to bear one-tenth of the burden that middle-class families would be asked to bear in a deficit reduction package. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s just something that is -- does not reflect where, frankly, the majority of Democrats, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect where the majority of independents, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect where the vast majority -- or I should say a large number, if not a majority of Republicans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last quick thing -- on \xe2\x80\x9cGood Morning America,\xe2\x80\x9d David Axelrod seemed to be hedging about whether the President is going to Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard.\xc2\xa0 He said his family is going on vacation; he may join them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If he can.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If he can.\xc2\xa0 So is that sort of if there\xe2\x80\x99s something going on with the economy he will not go?\xc2\xa0 Or are you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve covered the White House long enough to understand that any time that Presidential travel plans are made that they are subject to change.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you at this point that this President is planning to spend some time with his wife and two daughters in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard before his two daughters go back to school later this week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 Any chance he would travel outside of Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard for any kind of economic events while here\xe2\x80\x99s up there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no current plan for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the bus trip next week, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to Iowa, where the Republicans are having their straw poll tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Is that a political choice?\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the bus trip next week considered a political event?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because the President views it as one of the chief responsibilities in office to spend some time outside Washington, D.C., talking to people all across the country about the economy and about how they\xe2\x80\x99re impacted by the policy decisions that he\xe2\x80\x99s making here in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 That isn\xe2\x80\x99t just an appropriate thing for a President to do, it\xe2\x80\x99s something that a President should do.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s going to spend time in Minnesota, in Iowa, in Illinois doing exactly that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why Iowa?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Why Iowa?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because of the Republican events this week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, the -- there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a very robust debate about the economic policies in this country that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing in Iowa.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that the Iowa people are paying very close attention to.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s also a debate that\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Minnesota.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also a debate that\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Illinois.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to go to all three states to talk about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ari.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To go back to what Ben said earlier, when the President talked about some in Congress who would rather see their opponents lose than America win, he never said the word \xe2\x80\x9cRepublican.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does he think there are any Democrats who feel that way?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what the President was talking about was, he was talking about the dysfunction in our political system, primarily in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I think that he was frustrated by the way that that debate was conducted, even -- here we are, almost a week and a half after those discussions were concluded. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the President is hopeful that when Congress comes back from its recess that members of Congress will have heard from constituents, much like the President has heard, which is that this political dysfunction is not what the people voted for.\xc2\xa0 The American people voted for divided government but they did not vote for a dysfunctional government.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that has left the President pretty frustrated.\xc2\xa0 And he is optimistic that when Congress comes back that -- or at least he\xe2\x80\x99s hopeful that when Congress come back that we\xe2\x80\x99ll detect a noticeable change.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think there\xe2\x80\x99s blame to share across both parties, or does he think all the blame belongs within the Republican Party in Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear from the rhetoric that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Republicans that they were the source of the intransigence in this debate.\xc2\xa0 And I -- and, frankly, that\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of intransigence that the President thinks is not helpful; that we need to be in a position where we can put the country above a political partisan affiliation; that there is an opportunity for us to find common ground on a range of things, not just on deficit reduction, which the President and the Speaker obviously had a vibrant dialogue about, but also about a number of these other job creation opportunities, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s passing these free trade agreements, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s extending the payroll tax cut, that there is an opportunity for bipartisan action to put in place policies that will be beneficial to this economy not just in the long term but also in the short term.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The President has some specific policy ideas for job creation:\xc2\xa0 infrastructure bank, trade deals, renewing the payroll tax cut, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 If he\xe2\x80\x99s now considering some different economic proposals, is that -- does that suggest that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe the package that he\xe2\x80\x99s put together is adequate for the economic crisis?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 I think the way -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t describe it as him looking for different economic proposals.\xc2\xa0 I think this is a situation in which he\xe2\x80\x99s looking for additional economic proposals, additional things that we can do to get our economy moving again. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that there are a number of things that Congress can and should do right away, and things that the President would sign right away.\xc2\xa0 But the President, as I mentioned, he views it as his responsibility to be on the hunt for new ideas all the time.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about with the business leaders in their meeting today.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about with small business owners and other folks that he meets along the trail of the bus tour next week.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s something that he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be engaged in moving forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to follow up, given the polarization in Congress, is it realistic to think that the President can get a jobs package through that would create jobs on the scale that\xe2\x80\x99s needed to reduce the unemployment rate 250,000 a month, given that the House in particular shows no appetite for spending programs?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to make economic predictions or even projections from the podium here, but what I can tell you is that there are some -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan support for some policies that would no doubt do some things that are very constructive for our economy.\xc2\xa0 And the President is hopeful that folks will get on that right away.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, obviously this is something that the Congress is going to have to work out, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be engaged in a dialogue with Congress about how exactly to implement those policies.\xc2\xa0 But these are clearly policies that can have a significant impact on growing the economy both in the short term and in the long run.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the CEO meeting, was this meeting at all in response to the market turmoil that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this week and in general sort of the economic troubles around the world?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned earlier, Laura, these are the kinds of meetings that he\xe2\x80\x99s had many times with business leaders in the private sector since he took office two and a half years ago.\xc2\xa0 So I would not describe those meetings as a reaction to that, but I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that they will be discussing those kinds of things in the meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But was it set up this week after you knew about what was going on in the markets?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I got to tell you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly when this was put on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, but, again, this is not as if -- this is not -- obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s done meetings like this pretty often and pretty regularly because he does believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to consult with leaders in the private sector on these kinds of issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when it was added to the schedule.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that they\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly talk about those -- about these issues and about this market reaction here at that meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does he want to hear from them about the market?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned, I think that he\xe2\x80\x99s interested in hearing about their perspective on the economy, about the way that sort of our slow economic recovery has impacted their individual business.\xc2\xa0 He wants to hear from them how it\xe2\x80\x99s impacted their broader -- the sector that they are operating in, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s open to ideas.\xc2\xa0 If they have suggestions for things that we can do to get our economy moving, then he\xe2\x80\x99s open to hearing those as well.\xc2\xa0 I think that he expects this to be a genuine dialogue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kristen. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Going back to the bills that the President has asked Congress to pass right now, some congressional leaders are saying there really are a number of steps or changes to these bills that have to happen before they get through both chambers, so are there discussions going on right now behind the scenes to try to get these bills into a shape where they could actually pass through both chambers?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the kinds of proposals that the President and others in this administration have talked about at length are the kinds of things that already have bipartisan support, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the President -- as my answer to Kara alluded to, there are certainly some things to be worked out, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that these aren\xe2\x80\x99t the kinds of things that should pass pretty quickly with strong bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 Both because, frankly, if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to act in the best interests of the country, and if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to put that ahead of party, and if we genuinely are in a circumstance in which we are more interested in seeing America succeed than our political opponents lose, then the kinds of things that are going to be beneficial to our economy and have bipartisan support are the kinds of things that should move pretty quickly through the Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also -- okay, really quickly -- there are fresh signs that Elizabeth Warren might run for office in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to her about this?\xc2\xa0 Is he encouraging her to run?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the last time that they spoke.\xc2\xa0 My guess is that he\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of things on his plate that involve something other than recruiting candidates for the United States Senate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re doing great.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I will say this -- I mean, there has been an active dialogue that\xe2\x80\x99s been underway between the United States trade representative, other members of the administration, with the appropriate congressional leaders in the committees of jurisdiction.\xc2\xa0 We are in a place where we have seen Republicans advocating for passing these free trade agreements for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President was engaged in a pretty difficult exercise in working with the South Koreans and the Colombians and the Panamanians on these trade agreements, to put them in a place where we could be sure that these are trade agreements that would be in the best interest of American business and American workers.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these three trade agreements combined would create or support about 70,000 jobs here in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 So there is bipartisan agreement about this, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, when are you going to send them over?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, clearly the legislative mechanics are something that I\xe2\x80\x99m not intimately steeped in.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason -- I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s agreement here about the benefits of these trade agreements getting through the Congress, both here at the White House and Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll refer you to either Congress or to the USTR about the legislative mechanics of this.\xc2\xa0 But there is bipartisan agreement on this and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we should move on really quick.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back to the Vineyard briefly.\xc2\xa0 Did you suggest --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All I meant to do was to state the obvious to those of you who have covered the White House for such a long time, which is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel schedule is always malleable.\xc2\xa0 But in this case we anticipate that the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans to spend time with his family in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard will move forward as scheduled.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Rebecca, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 When the President arrives on the bus tour next week, what kind of reception is he expecting from the people, and what -- and economic conditions, what is he waiting to see down there?\xc2\xa0 What is he expecting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that he\xe2\x80\x99ll see a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 I think one is, I do think the President will be pleased -- or I should say it this way, the people will be pleased to see the President outside of Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 I do think that Democrats, independents and Republicans expect to see their President of the United States outside of Washington, D.C., out from behind the podium, spending time talking to the American people in their communities about the economy and the range of other issues that are being discussed here at the White House and how they\xe2\x80\x99re influenced by those policy debates.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that -- so I think that the American people, regardless of whether, frankly, they\xe2\x80\x99re supporters of the President or not, will be pleased to see the President outside of Washington, D.C., and out among the people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do think that the President does anticipate that he\xe2\x80\x99ll detect a little frustration about the dysfunction in Congress, and the strident position of some in Congress to put their partisan affiliation ahead of the country.\xc2\xa0 I think that there will be people who are frustrated by that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I also anticipate that there will be some people who are supporters of the President, who voted for him last time, who will have some questions for him about the compromises that he was willing to make in the context of this deficit debate.\xc2\xa0 But that is something that the President believes is an important part of leadership, and an important part of resolving this problem is moving off our maximalist positions and demonstrating a willingness to compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think -- there will be -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on this.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Vilsack and Dan Pfeiffer are doing a conference call later today.\xc2\xa0 So if you have additional questions or need some additional language on this, then I would refer you to that call.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before I go, we will do a week ahead, although I think everybody sort of knows largely what\xe2\x80\x99s included here.\xc2\xa0 So -- but I\xe2\x80\x99ll go ahead and do the reading here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will travel to Minnesota to begin his three-day bus tour in the Midwest.\xc2\xa0 While in the Midwest, the President will discuss ways to grow the economy, strengthen the middle class, and accelerate hiring in communities and towns across the nation, and hear directly from Americans, including small business owners, local families, private sector leaders, rural organizations, and government officials.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President knows we must do everything we can to promote economic growth, restore confidence in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s future, and enhance the sense of optimism for future generations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After arriving in Minnesota, the President will host a town hall event in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, at Lower Hannah\xe2\x80\x99s Bend Park.\xc2\xa0 Later that day, the President will hold a town hall in lovely Decorah, Iowa.\xc2\xa0 I highly recommend it for those of you that have not been there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, the President will hold a Rural Economic Forum in Peosta, Iowa. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday, the President will hold town hall meetings in Atkinson and Alpha, Illinois, before returning to Washington, D.C.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say those cities --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
