Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:03 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 Happy Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 Hope you had an enjoyable Veterans Day, which reminds me that, as you probably know by now, the President is enjoying lunch with servicemembers at Molly Malone\'s, an establishment here in Washington, in advance of the annual dinner he\'ll be having with combatant commanders tonight.</p>\n<p>I have a couple of toppers to give to you.\xc2\xa0 First, I wanted to note that the First Lady delivered remarks today at Bell Multicultural High School, a high school in the Washington, D.C. area.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady\'s remarks continued to expand her focus on issues of youth empowerment and education, in particular working to achieve the President\'s North Star goal that by the year 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0In her remarks, the First Lady spoke directly to young people about committing to their education so that they can create a better future for themselves and their country.\xc2\xa0 Following the First Lady\'s remarks, she was participating in a conversation with a 10th grade class at Bell about her own personal story of working hard toward her education.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Education Arne Duncan also participated.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I wanted to note that at 5:30 p.m. today the Senate will have a cloture vote on Nina Pillard, another of the President\'s three nominees to the D.C. Circuit Court.\xc2\xa0 Pillard is an accomplished litigator and professor.\xc2\xa0 Her career includes landmark accomplishments on behalf of women and families, such as helping defend the constitutionality of the Family and Medical Leave Act and helping open the doors of the Virginia Military Institute to female students.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0It is time for Senate Republicans to stop playing politics with our courts.\xc2\xa0 Fifteen of the last nineteen judges confirmed to this court were nominated by Republican Presidents -- 15 of the last 19.\xc2\xa0 But now that a Democratic President is fulfilling his constitutional duty and nominating judges, Republicans make cynical arguments in an effort to maintain an ideological edge.\xc2\xa0 More of President Obama\'s nominees to the D.C. Circuit have been successfully filibustered than those of any other President in history.\xc2\xa0 We urge the Senate to consider all of these nominations on their merits, starting with tonight\'s cloture vote for Nina Pillard.</p>\n<p>Finally, I wanted to note a phone call the President had earlier.\xc2\xa0 This morning, President Obama spoke with President Aquino of the Philippines to express our deep condolences for the lives lost and damage caused by super Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda, one of the largest, strongest storms to ever hit land.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, the President directed the administration to mount a swift and coordinated response to save lives and provide assistance to alleviate suffering.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>USAID and the Department of Defense are providing significant assistance to the people of the Philippines.\xc2\xa0 Even before the storm reached land, USAID had deployed a disaster assistance response team to the area.\xc2\xa0 After landfall, U.S. Marines were some of the first to help deliver supplies for the relief effort.\xc2\xa0 American aircraft are delivering vital assistance and equipment.\xc2\xa0 The United States is also providing food aid to feed tens of thousands of people in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the aircraft carrier USS George Washington and several escort ships are on their way to the Philippines.\xc2\xa0 On arrival, they will help expand search-and-rescue operations, provide medical care, and serve as platforms for a base of helicopters working to deliver supplies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our State Department and USAID team on the ground is coordinating with local officials and other organizations.\xc2\xa0 And in the days ahead, the United States will continue to work with the Philippines to deliver whatever help we can as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And with that, I take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Julie, I just want to remind people I think we have a preset for the President\'s announcement at 2:00 p.m.\xc2\xa0 Yes, Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to get your reaction to a comment that President Clinton made in an interview that was posted today.\xc2\xa0 He was talking about health care, and he said that President Obama should honor his commitment to people who have lost their health care or are losing their health care under the President\'s law, even if it means changing that law.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with that comment?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as you saw the President say in an interview with NBC last week, the answer is yes.\xc2\xa0 The President has tasked his team with looking at a range of options, as he said, to make sure that nobody is put in a position where their plans have been canceled and they can\'t afford a better plan, even though they\'d like to have a better plan.\xc2\xa0 So you heard the President address this very issue in his interview last week.</p>\n<p>And I think it\'s important to note that President Clinton in that interview also said, and I quote, "The big lesson is that we are better off with this law than without it."\xc2\xa0 And he said, "The enrollment period did not come off well because the national website wasn\'t ready.\xc2\xa0 But this happened once before.\xc2\xa0 It happened when President Bush put in the Medicare drug program for seniors, which was not as complicated, but had exactly the same problem with the rollout.\xc2\xa0 It was a disaster.\xc2\xa0 There were people that lost their prescriptions for their existing medicine, and they fixed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President, as you know, has pledged to ask his team, task his team to look at potential actions that could be taken to address this problem, because his focus is on making sure that people get quality and affordable health insurance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what the President said appears to be slightly different from what President Clinton said.\xc2\xa0 President Clinton seems to be talking about anybody who is losing their plan.\xc2\xa0 And what the President said, and officials afterwards said, was that they were focused more on people who were getting cancellations and then maybe weren\'t getting subsidies to cover higher premiums.\xc2\xa0 So is what President Obama is looking at more narrow than the broader universe of people getting cancellations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly the point we\'ve made is that for more than half of those on the individual market who because their plans were not grandfathered in -- they did not exist or they were not participants in those plans prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act -- more than half of those individuals will have higher quality insurance with better basic protections at the same or lower cost.\xc2\xa0 Roughly half -- or maybe that is roughly half -- more than half will qualify for subsidies.\xc2\xa0 Some will qualify for Medicaid in those states where Medicaid has been expanded.</p>\n<p>For the universe of people of -- that smaller group of people within that 5 percent of the population for whom the fact that they\'ve gotten a cancellation notice because they purchased plans perhaps in the last couple of years that do not meet the minimum standards and they are facing challenges in terms of affordability, the President has asked his team to look at ways to address that problem.\xc2\xa0 And that goes to the point he made about the vast majority of Americans here who, if they\xe2\x80\x99re in employer-provided insurance or Medicare or Medicaid or VA, will not have any changes if they don\xe2\x80\x99t want them.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the only changes they\xe2\x80\x99ll see have to do with improvements to benefits.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another point on health care, there are some reports out about enrollment numbers, putting them at about 40,000 to 50,000.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that those numbers are accurate?\xc2\xa0 And if not, can you tell us when the administration expects to put out numbers?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I cannot confirm those numbers.\xc2\xa0 There have been a variety of reports saying a variety of different things.\xc2\xa0 The administration will be releasing data about enrollment in the middle of the month -- I anticipate it will be later this week -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along, consistent with the way that data like this is released for other programs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I would add two things.\xc2\xa0 First, it was always the case, even prior to the problems with the launch of the website, that enrollment in the first month would be low.\xc2\xa0 That is the experience we saw in Massachusetts and it is the experience we expect here -- because especially for healthier, younger people, the pattern of behavior is to shop around, to wait before you purchase when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to purchase before December 15th in order to have insurance on January 1st, which is the earliest possible date for coverage.\xc2\xa0 So we expect that pattern to play out with the marketplaces in the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the fact that the website has been so challenging and so problematic in that first month means that the enrollment numbers will be even lower than expected.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific figures.\xc2\xa0 I have not seen specific figures.\xc2\xa0 But I anticipate that we will be releasing data about enrollment by the end of the week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific date set?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke last week about gaps and problems with the rollout of the website that need to be fixed.\xc2\xa0 What are those gaps?\xc2\xa0 And what fixes would you anticipate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he was referring to -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll quote -- \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve assigned my team to see what we can do to close some of the holes and gaps in the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And he was addressing the issue of cancellations and some of the concerns that he has about individuals who have had their existing policies canceled, and that issue has obviously gotten a lot of attention.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The problems with the website, which you just mentioned, are being addressed by a team of tech experts as well as by Jeff Zients, who\xe2\x80\x99s verseeing that team.\xc2\xa0 And they essentially have a punch list of problems that need to be fixed in different areas of the website, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been working through that punch list and making progress -- gradual progress each day.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the website is functioning better today than it was a week ago or 10 days ago, and certainly much better than it was in the first two weeks of October.\xc2\xa0 But there is more work to be done as Mr. Zients has said.</p>\n<p>So that work continues.\xc2\xa0 And our goal is to have that website functioning effectively for the vast majority of Americans by the end of this month.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if it\xe2\x80\x99s not up to par by the end of the month, do you have a plan B in place, alternative?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We expect it to be functioning properly and effectively for the vast majority of Americans by the end of the month.\xc2\xa0 What we have been doing since the issues with the website arose, it has focused -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve expanded our efforts to create ways through which Americans can get more information about the options available to them, both by in-person consultations or over the phone; they can also apply and enroll by mail.\xc2\xa0 So those efforts continue.</p>\n<p>But we expect -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m citing here -- those closer to the ground, that the site will be functioning effectively by the end of the month for the vast majority of users.\xc2\xa0 I think I said last week, and I would reiterate, and I think I said the week before, that any website of this size and complexity will occasionally have issues with it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true of major websites today in the commercial sphere.\xc2\xa0 But we expect it to be functioning effectively for the vast majority of users so that they can navigate through it, review their options, find out whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re eligible for tax credits, and choose coverage that fits their needs, both their financial needs and their coverage needs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether Todd Park will testify before Congress tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to point out the administration\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary cooperation with the six separate congressional committees currently conducting oversight into the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 As you have all seen and covered, administration officials have testified at numerous committee interviews and briefings, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve testified at more than two dozen congressional hearings, including four in just the last two weeks.\xc2\xa0 The administration has also produced thousands of pages of documents, and our cooperation on these issues continues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The subpoena issued by House Republicans on Friday is an unfortunate and unnecessary step, since we made clear several times that Todd Park is willing to testify.\xc2\xa0 The issue for us is not a question of if he will testify, but when.\xc2\xa0 We had hoped the committee would work with us to find an alternative date to give Mr. Park time to focus on his immediate task at hand, which is getting the website fixed.\xc2\xa0 This is a goal that is ostensibly shared by the very House Republicans now demanding his appearance on Wednesday -- an appearance that would take him away from his work on the website.\xc2\xa0 In fact, Chairman Issa told CBS News a few weeks ago that he wanted the website fixed and \xe2\x80\x9cfixed quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Well, Todd Park is very much engaged in the effort of fixing it as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I have no update on that except to tell you that the Office of Science and Technology has said they are reviewing the subpoena and they will respond as appropriate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask about Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Iran\xe2\x80\x99s I guess foreign minister has sort of rejected the claim that it was Iran that was the result of the failure to reach an agreement in Geneva recently, and has said that divisions among Western nations were the cause of the failure of the talks.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on that?\xc2\xa0 Is it really up to the West to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can tell you is simply that the P5-plus-1 were unified on the proposal that was put forward, and that the Iranians did not accept that proposal, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a statement of fact.\xc2\xa0 There was important progress made at these negotiations, and they were cordial and substantive and serious.\xc2\xa0 But as I said, the P5-plus-1 were united there and we remain united in our proposal to Iran and our approach to these negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Gaps remain, and there are still important issues to be addressed between the P5-plus-1 and Iran, and that is why there will be a break, as you know, and the P5-plus-1 will resume negotiations with Iran on November 21st and 22nd.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I want to caution everyone, because there\xe2\x80\x99s been a substantial amount of speculation about the details of the proposal, against believing rumors and incorrect reports or prejudging outcomes.\xc2\xa0 Both the P5-plus-1 and Iran have been very disciplined in keeping the details of the negotiations private, and that is a sign of the seriousness of what is taking place, and it has also allowed us to make the progress that we have made.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get into details about our negotiating positions.\xc2\xa0 But to be clear, the purposes of these negotiations is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s one objective here.\xc2\xa0 The reason why we are here, the reason why negotiations are taking place, is because of the very focused effort in building an international consensus and building a punitive sanctions regime around Iranian behavior and Iran\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to comply with its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 Because of that effort, over the several years since it\xe2\x80\x99s been in place, we now have a diplomatic opening.\xc2\xa0 We have a willingness, because of the concentrated effect of these sanctions, by Iran to pursue the possibility of resolving this diplomatically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Resolving this diplomatically is the best way to resolve it; it is the responsibility of the President to pursue a diplomatic opening.\xc2\xa0 Because the best way to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon is to achieve an agreement through diplomacy -- an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s verifiable, that\xe2\x80\x99s transparent, and that requires Iran to take concrete steps.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The alternative is military action.\xc2\xa0 The President has never taken any option off the table, and he does not now and will not.\xc2\xa0 But it is his responsibility as President to pursue a diplomatic opening, to see if it is possible to resolve this issue peacefully.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any assurance that Secretary Kerry can provide lawmakers on the Hill when he speaks to them that would persuade them to hold off on tightening sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman are briefing the Senate Banking Committee tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s part of a broader effort to consult with Congress and update them on the P5-plus-1 negotiations, as well as our consultations with our allies.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to the issue of new sanctions legislation, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember no one is suggesting an open-ended delay for new sanctions, because there may come a point where additional sanctions are necessary.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it is important for Congress to reserve its ability to legislate for the moment when it is most effective in order to give the current P5-plus-1 negotiations the best chance to make real progress in achieving our shared goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So again, this is not about being for or against sanctions.\xc2\xa0 This administration has imposed the most crippling sanctions in history against Iran, and we appreciate the leverage those sanctions have given us and we appreciate the partnership that Congress has given us in that effort.\xc2\xa0 But this is a decision to support diplomacy and a possible peaceful resolution to this issue.\xc2\xa0 The American people, justifiably and understandably, prefer a peaceful solution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And this agreement, if it\xe2\x80\x99s achieved, has the potential to do that.\xc2\xa0 The American people do not want a march to war.\xc2\xa0 And it is important to understand that if pursuing a resolution diplomatically is disallowed or ruled out, what options then do we and our allies have to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along, as we have ratcheted up sanctions and increased the isolation and pressure in Tehran, that the window for resolving this diplomatically was open, but that it would not remain open forever.\xc2\xa0 And short of an agreement, Iran will continue to make progress in its nuclear program.</p>\n<p>So we need to pursue this.\xc2\xa0 We need to see if Iran is serious.\xc2\xa0 And any deal that we and the [P5-plus-1] might reach with Iran will be one that absolutely meets our standards that would be verifiable and concrete.\xc2\xa0 Any initial relief as part of the first phase would be reversible and modest.\xc2\xa0 It would not in any way change the sanctions architecture that\xe2\x80\x99s in place, but it would allow for essentially putting some time on the clock, because it would halt [progress on] Iran\xe2\x80\x99s program and roll back aspects of its program.\xc2\xa0 And if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do that, the United States won\xe2\x80\x99t agree to it.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, getting back to former President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s comments, you were saying at the beginning of the briefing that the President does agree with what former President Clinton said.\xc2\xa0 But former President Clinton did say, \xe2\x80\x9cI personally believe even if it takes a change in the law, the President should honor the commitment the federal government made.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So the President agrees even if it takes a change in the law, that this pledge is going to be kept?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I just said, Jim, is that the President has instructed his team to look at a range of options, and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t announced one way or the other -- although, understandably, you and others ask us for details on what is under consideration, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t announced any potential fixes or moves that we might be able to make to address this problem.\xc2\xa0 But the President is, as you heard him say in his interview with NBC -- he\xe2\x80\x99s very interested in trying to address this problem, and looks forward to being presented the options that he might be able to pursue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you be in a situation where if you were trying to help people keep the plans that they have now, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you might be trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube?\xc2\xa0 And that hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of Americans have received these notifications already, how do you go back and allow those people to keep those insurance plans?\xc2\xa0 That just seems practically impossible.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would say, Jim, is that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics about avenues that might be available to the President to address this problem until he\xe2\x80\x99s chosen which option he wants to pursue.\xc2\xa0 The broader thing that we have to remember here is that the overall majority -- overwhelming majority, rather, that the American people either get their insurance through their employers and will not see a change, get their insurance through Medicare or Medicaid or the VA and will not see a change, except for those changes that improve the coverage they get and improve the benefits they get, because they apply to everyone -- not just those who purchase plans in the marketplaces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Others, as you know -- because some states have made the decision to help their own constituents, their own people, by expanding the Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act -- will extend insurance to hundreds of thousands, millions of Americans who will become newly eligible for Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 And then, others will be able to find an array of options available to them for purchase through the marketplaces.</p>\n<p>Now, that effort, in terms of the shopping period, has been made more difficult, frustratingly so, because of the problems with the website.\xc2\xa0 But there is a team focused daily, seven days a week, on making improvements to that website so the American people have a better experience while they\xe2\x80\x99re shopping for plans and registering and enrolling for coverage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And getting back to the interview that the President did with NBC, he apologized to the people who were losing their plans despite the assurances he gave.\xc2\xa0 But what about whether or not the statement itself was misleading -- \xe2\x80\x9cif you like your plan, you can keep it\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 The Senate Whip Dick Durbin was on CNN earlier today, and he said that perhaps if a couple of sentences had been added to the end of that pledge, that might have clarified things.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President gave a pretty extensive interview in which this was the central topic of discussion, and I would point you to what he said.\xc2\xa0 He obviously expressed regret about the fact that the law has not addressed some of these individuals the way that he would like, and therefore he has asked his team to come up with some solutions that he can review.</p>\n<p>So the overall effort here has to be on implementing the Affordable Care Act, standing up the marketplaces so that these millions of Americans are presented with the far better options that the Affordable Care Act allows them for affordable, quality health insurance for many of whom that\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s been out of reach for a long time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And he is focused on getting it right -- because it is a fact that, come January 1st, there will be millions more Americans with insurance coverage who didn\xe2\x80\x99t have it before, and there will be millions -- other millions of Americans who will have higher quality insurance than they had before.\xc2\xa0 They won\xe2\x80\x99t be subjected to a marketplace in which insurers could charge Julianna double for the same plan that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got because she\xe2\x80\x99s a woman.\xc2\xa0 They can\xe2\x80\x99t put a lifetime or annual cap on the benefits that you receive.\xc2\xa0 They can\xe2\x80\x99t carve out exemptions for certain conditions, chronic conditions that you might have, that you might need benefits to cover.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that is the underlying purpose of the Affordable Care Act -- to make sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s a structure in place that creates higher competition under the private sector model that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had, keeps down prices, and allows millions of Americans to get access to affordable, quality insurance and health care that they have not had in the past.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on those enrollment numbers, is the administration confident that those numbers will be accurate given all the problems with the insurers being able to sort through the data and figure out which applications are correct and properly submitted, and so forth and so on?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to work very hard over at CMS and HHS to compile the data and present the most accurate data available.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question in light of the fact that some on Capitol Hill have been demanding data daily.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made the point that, consistent with the release of data for other programs, that is in the interest of everybody to do this on a monthly basis so that the data is as accurate as possible.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been crystal clear the number is going to be low for the first month.\xc2\xa0 Is there any number that would concern the White House?\xc2\xa0 Is there any number that is so low --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can guarantee you that the number that is released will be lower than we had hoped and anticipated because of the problems with the website.\xc2\xa0 And that is why it is so important to focus our energies on fixing the problems, and that goes to the subpoena we were talking about earlier, and the attempt to remove somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s very much a key part of the effort to fix the website from his job for a certain amount of time.\xc2\xa0 And it raises questions about how sincere critics are when it comes to joining with us in the effort to try to fix the problems that exist.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking -- all that, I said you made it very clear, as I said.\xc2\xa0 But is there any number that would be so low that you would say, wow, alarm bells are going off, we have a problem?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jon, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a very creative way to try to set expectations.\xc2\xa0 And the only expectations I\xe2\x80\x99ll set is that we expect them to be low.\xc2\xa0 We expected them to be low as a percentage of the overall number of people who would enroll by the end of the six-month period in any case, because that is the experience that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Massachusetts and in similar kinds of programs.\xc2\xa0 Younger, healthier people, especially, tend to wait until the last minute to enroll in these kinds of programs.\xc2\xa0 And overall, I think, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re young or old, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to enroll until a certain time, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to take your time to look at your options and wait until late in the process.\xc2\xa0 That was certainly what happened in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you\xe2\x80\x99re defining enrollment, there\xe2\x80\x99s been some reporting about how the numbers would be.\xc2\xa0 Are you going to be including people who have picked out a health care plan and put it in their shopping cart but haven\xe2\x80\x99t actually paid for it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to HHS and CMS for how they define enrollment.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that it is consistent with the way Massachusetts did it.\xc2\xa0 It is consistent with the way the states are doing it.\xc2\xa0 The marketplace experience or process ends when a person selects a plan -- essentially presses \xe2\x80\x9cenroll\xe2\x80\x9d in a plan.\xc2\xa0 And after that, it becomes a contract between the private insurer and the individual.\xc2\xa0 So the process they\xe2\x80\x99re using, as I understand it, will be consistent with what Massachusetts did and with what the states are doing.\xc2\xa0 And more details obviously will be available when those data are released.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the number of people who enroll going to be lower than those that have been receiving cancellation notices?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I would simply ask you to wait until the data are released.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the enrollment figures will be low and were going to be low anyway.\xc2\xa0 They will be significantly lower because of the challenges posed by the faulty website.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What will that say?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what kind of message is that if more people are receiving cancellation notices than have actually been able to enroll?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that it would say two things.\xc2\xa0 One, the history of these kinds of programs -- and Massachusetts is the best model -- show that enrollment is very slow early on.\xc2\xa0 I think there were only 123 people in Massachusetts who enrolled in the first month.\xc2\xa0 And while it\xe2\x80\x99s a small state, it\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonably populous state, and 123 is a very low number.</p>\n<p>In the end, I think more than 36,000 people enrolled in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 So I think as a guidepost, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good indicator, even without troubles with the website of what kind of sort of phased-in process of enrollment we\xe2\x80\x99re likely to see.\xc2\xa0 That lowness will be undoubtedly compounded by the problems with the website that have made it so much harder for individuals to shop and enroll.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a clarification on the Bill Clinton -- he said even if it takes changes to the laws, is the White House open to legal changes to an act of Congress to address this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All I can say at this point, Jon, is that the President has asked his team to come up with a range of options, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not focused on any particular one.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re looking at ones that effectively address the problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those that have been described here are within the context of the law and working with state insurance commissioners.\xc2\xa0 Is that the orbit the President is looking at and asked his team, meaning they don\xe2\x80\x99t include seeking a change to the law that would have to go through Congress?\xc2\xa0 Because people who have talked to me about it believe the legislative climate is just too difficult to look in that direction.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would beg your indulgence and give you the same answer I just gave Jon, which is that at this time, the President has asked his team to look at the options that might be available to pursue.\xc2\xa0 And once we have an announcement to make, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make one.</p>\n<p>I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that he wants to address this problem and have as many people who are affected here helped as possible.\xc2\xa0 And so he would look for an option that is effective rather than one that cannot be achieved.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you acknowledge that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard to do?\xc2\xa0 People who are experts in this area have said insurance policies have already gone out and it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to retroactively, as Jim mentioned, un-cancel something; that you need state insurance regulatory permission to do that -- that that\xe2\x80\x99s why you need to have these conversations with the state insurance commissioners.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the law itself has very-defined poverty levels -- 400 percent -- if you are above that, how do you create a new subsidy tranche for people who don\xe2\x80\x99t fall into that income category that\xe2\x80\x99s just defined by the law?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this seems like a very difficult thing for you to handle outside of a legislative fix.\xc2\xa0 Would you acknowledge that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think in general these issues are challenging, which is why it took a century of effort for it to come to fruition -- the passage of comprehensive health insurance reform.\xc2\xa0 And you described some of the general challenges that are out there.\xc2\xa0 I would send you over to CMS and their daily briefing for more details.\xc2\xa0 My guess is they\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask that you wait for details about what the President is going to decide until --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- they\xe2\x80\x99ll send us here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, probably not to send you over here, but to simply say what I can tell you, which is I\xe2\x80\x99m not really going to discuss in any detail the options the President might be considering, because when he makes a decision we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>And just to clarify, because it\xe2\x80\x99s been described this way to me -- what the President is looking at is for those who are in the individual market, who don\xe2\x80\x99t qualify for subsidies but that their premiums are higher than they can afford, this is kind of a -- to use your phrase, the elegy from the past -- a slice of a slice of a slice.\xc2\xa0 Is that what the President is trying and asked his team to identify and solve?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to overly define the universe because that\xe2\x80\x99s work that\xe2\x80\x99s being done by policy experts, but I think that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair characterization?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\'s a fair characterization of people who are most affected by this problem.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, if you\'re somebody who enrolled in a plan and you now have a -- and paid for it and it was a substandard plan, and now you are eligible for Medicaid, because you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, the President is not asking his team to figure out those --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So what I\'m saying is it\'s obviously not every individual in the individual market today.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I\'m not going to get into defining the population here.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll let the policy experts --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the timeline for this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a timeline for it, except the President asked for something, and when he asks for something people tend to work on it very quickly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very good.\xc2\xa0 On Iran, quickly.\xc2\xa0 It sounded here, Thursday, as if you had rhetoric to describe what you thought might happen, and it didn\'t happen.\xc2\xa0 And the theory behind what was trying to be accomplished in Geneva was sort of a cap on a cap -- the Iranians cap where they are and the P5-plus-1 agrees to cap sanctions.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a general formulation I\'ve seen as describing what was being sought.\xc2\xa0 Is that still the goal?\xc2\xa0 Or did this experience in Geneva make the U.S. and the P5-plus-1 reconsider this idea of an initial agreement that would come before a much bigger one?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is our approach, and the P5-plus-1\'s approach, to essentially phase this in, in two phases.\xc2\xa0 The first phase would halt progress on Iran\'s nuclear program and roll back key aspects of the program.\xc2\xa0 The second component of that, the relief component, would -- the only relief we would consider would be limited, it would be temporary, and it would be reversible.\xc2\xa0 We would take no steps -- and this addresses the cap on sanctions -- it would take no steps that undermine the architecture of our sanctions regime.</p>\n<p>I think I described it last week as essentially a spigot that you could turn down a little bit or turn up, but it would be something that would be easily reversible.\xc2\xa0 It would be temporary, and it would require steps taken by Iran to halt progress on its nuclear program and to roll back certain aspects of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I can tell you that the areas that we are concerned about, our most serious concerns are the possibility of Iran producing a sufficient quantity of highly enriched uranium for one nuclear weapon, which is commonly referred to as a \xe2\x80\x9cbreakout capability.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Two, the possibility of Iran stockpiling centrifuges or increasing the efficiency of those -- of the centrifuges they have.\xc2\xa0 Also, Iran\'s ability to produce plutonium using the Arak reactor.\xc2\xa0 And finally, bringing unprecedented transparency and monitoring of Iran\'s program.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0So those are the four areas around which the negotiations are focused when it comes to actions, concrete actions that the P5-plus-1 is asking Iran to take.\xc2\xa0 And again, when it comes to the relief component of this, it\'s very important to be clear:\xc2\xa0 The sanctions regime stays in place.\xc2\xa0 We built the regime working with our allies, the most punishing regime in history.\xc2\xa0 And it has had a profound effect, and it has created this opportunity potentially for resolving this international challenge diplomatically.\xc2\xa0 We ought to pursue that option, pursue that opportunity.\xc2\xa0 But as Secretary Kerry and the President and others have made clear, we will only reach an agreement, we and the other members of the P5-plus-1 with Iran, if it\'s a good deal that ensures concrete Iranian actions that are verifiable and transparent.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You asked a rhetorical question a few months ago:\xc2\xa0 What options then do we have?\xc2\xa0 This is the Chief Executive -- the President of the United States, the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 He knows the answer to that question.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No question.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made abundantly clear throughout his presidency that he takes no options off the table, and that remains true today when it comes to dealing with the potential for Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 But it is his responsibility to pursue a diplomatic resolution of this problem if one is available, and we have to test whether or not it is available.\xc2\xa0 It is in the interest of the American people that we do that.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if pursuing a diplomatic opening is something that some say we should not do, they ought to be explicit about the fact that they\'re suggesting the only alternative is use of force.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we should never take the use of force off the table, but that it is his responsibility as Commander-in-Chief, his responsibility as President to take advantage of the impact of this comprehensive sanctions regime and the opening it has created to see if Iran is serious about resolving this peacefully.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question.\xc2\xa0 It was credibly reported last week that already the administration had slightly eased up on some of the financial sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Josh Rogin reported that last week.\xc2\xa0 Can you categorically say whether or not any softening or easing of the sanctions has been undertaken in order to signal to the Iranians that this would be a worthwhile endeavor for them to engage in?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not aware of that, and I would refer you to Treasury when it comes to financial matters.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the sanctions regime is in place and it is extremely broad and punishing and effective.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to alter it in a way?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the specific programs function in different ways.\xc2\xa0 So for specifics about those programs that especially deal with financial matters and institutions, I would refer you to Treasury.\xc2\xa0 But there has certainly been no agreement reached that would provide any kind of relief with the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there was not an agreement in Geneva; there was progress, and it was a productive and substantive, cordial series of negotiations, and very serious.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s only even moderate, modest relief if the Iranians agree to concrete actions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the President troubled by security concerns in the healthcare.gov website which one CMS memo described as \xe2\x80\x9climitless\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you are elliptically referring to the selectively released memo to CBS that -- by the committee, in the habit that it tends to embrace, which had to do with portions of the website that are not and will not be operative until the spring.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the fact of the matter is security is a constant issue that is addressed.\xc2\xa0 The head of CMS and others have discussed this in their testimony, and it is absolutely imperative -- and we go through this process rigorously -- to ensure that security is maintained so that people\xe2\x80\x99s personal data is protected.\xc2\xa0 And that is the case, and it will continue to be the case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he support Senator Hagan\xe2\x80\x99s call for an investigation of cost overruns?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, if I can very quickly, getting back to what President Clinton said.\xc2\xa0 He said that he thought the President should honor the commitment and let them keep what they\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\xc2\xa0 So just to be very clear, is the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to try to look for fixes to let people keep the plans that they already have, or to accommodate them in terms of new plans they would be required to get through Obamacare?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Peter, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to review the options available to the President.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let him review those options and make a decision about how we want to move forward on this issue, which he said on your network is one that concerns him.\xc2\xa0 Once a decision is made, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 We spoke with one of the architects of both the plan -- the Massachusetts health care system and the Obamacare health care system, who said a variety of things, and basically said that if some people are allowed to stay on their old plans and other people are then forced to get in the Obamacare system because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any coverage, then the whole system collapses; basically, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way to balance both.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House acknowledge that there is no way to make both of those work?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s written into the law that those with grandfathered plans can stay on those plans indefinitely, so I think that would --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to the additional people, people who presently have plans through 2013 -- so after the March 2010 date through 2013.\xc2\xa0 In other words, if the President tries to accommodate for saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you like your plan, you can keep your plan,\xe2\x80\x9d and says, you bought your plan in July of 2012; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it to come out that way, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let you keep your plan -- according to the architects of both plans in Massachusetts and the federal plan, the system would collapse.\xc2\xa0 It creates an imbalance.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House concede that much?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All I would say is I think this gets to some of the proposed legislation, that any fix that would essentially open up for insurers the ability to sell new plans that did not meet standards would create more problems than it fixed, because it would essentially allow insurers to offer plans that charged women double, or didn\xe2\x80\x99t cover basic services, or imposed caps and then charged prices that undercut prices of other plans that kept to the basic coverage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cover it in that system.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, but Peter, I think, again, the law as written allowed for the grandfathering in of any plan if somebody wanted to keep it that was in existence prior to the passage of the law.\xc2\xa0 So obviously, there is some capacity for that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also true, depending on the state and what\xe2\x80\x99s allowed by state insurance rules, that insurers have the option and insured individuals on the individual market have the option of taking early renewal of existing individual insurance plans.\xc2\xa0 But that obviously depends on the state and depends on the insurance company.\xc2\xa0 Some insurance companies haven\xe2\x80\x99t offered those early renewals as I understand it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a little -- I know that muddies up the clarity of your question, but the clarity of your question doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really apply to the pretty complex circumstances here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then, very quickly, you said a little bit earlier that while you\xe2\x80\x99re considering potential actions right now, and while the desire is that by the end of the month the vast majority of Americans will be able to enroll through the website, I guess the question very simply is:\xc2\xa0 Right now, is the White House telling Americans who are considering enrolling right now that they should not go to the website and do not begin that effort until December 1st?\xc2\xa0 Are you saying, hey, try it, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t promise you it will work right now</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying all along that the website has functioned at a sub-effective level since October 1st, but there have been those who have been able to enroll, shop.\xc2\xa0 And as --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this a good use of your time right now, or is the message, wait?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think every individual ought to avail himself or herself of the options that are presented here in terms of getting information.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly a good place to go if you want to shop for, look at the options broadly that you have, type in your ZIP code and other data.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess, is it safe and does the information get through accurately?\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to tell those people that it\xe2\x80\x99s safe and the information will get through accurately?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is safe, and I would refer you to CMS and HHS for more details.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is -- again, somebody was just citing reports of enrollment figures.\xc2\xa0 The fact is whatever the numbers are that we release, people are getting enrolled.\xc2\xa0 They are simply having a much more difficult time because of the website than is acceptable, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have to make sure that the website improvements continue so that the -- you said the vast majority of the American people.\xc2\xa0 I think you meant --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of the uninsured.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the vast majority of Americans who want to explore their options on the marketplaces, which are really designed for about 15 percent of the American people, are able to do so.</p>\n<p>New York Times.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just one last time to make sure I understand.\xc2\xa0 Forget about what the President\xe2\x80\x99s options are.\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify for us what the problem is he wants to solve?\xc2\xa0 Is it helping people keep their insurance, or is it helping people afford new insurance that they are going to be still required to get?\xc2\xa0 Those are not -- that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do with what the options are that are in front of him.\xc2\xa0 Which is the problem that he\xe2\x80\x99s pledging to fix?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President address this in his interview.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was confused, so help me.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that the President is concerned about those individuals who find themselves -- because they either purchased insurance in the last year or two since the Affordable Care Act passed, or there\xe2\x80\x99s been so much churn in the market that their plans were changed and downgraded, and they are confronted with a situation where even though the coverage is better, the cost may be a challenge for them.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to define the affected population here more specifically because I think I want to let the policy people do that who are looking at the options here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re -- I mean, without necessarily saying it 100 percent, it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re heading towards that latter piece where you\xe2\x80\x99re saying the real concern here is the affordability question, and that the direction you guys are heading is, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to let people keep substandard plans -- which, frankly, you guys have always railed against anyway and say that they\xe2\x80\x99re awful.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to let people keep those, we\xe2\x80\x99re simply going to find a way somehow, with extra subsidies or something -- which are the options that you\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about -- to fix the affordability question.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve accurately diagnosed the problem that is most concerning to the President.\xc2\xa0 How he assesses the options available for addressing that problem, I will leave to him and to the experts who are compiling the options.</p>\n<p>What is not, I think, an effective fix is one that, as envisioned on the Hill by some legislation, that would simply tell insurers that they can sell substandard plans to anybody who might purchase them, because that would cause more problems and create more problems and do more harm than any good it would do for individuals in this market who might be affected.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last quick question on a different subject.\xc2\xa0 Does the President still retain full confidence in Mr. Clapper going forward -- the DNI?\xc2\xa0 There were some suggestion in some article today in our paper, that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Some -- like, you make it sound like something on a blog in -- you know?\xc2\xa0 The President does, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I just follow up on what we were just talking about?\xc2\xa0 Because you\xe2\x80\x99re addressing the legislation, can you clarify?\xc2\xa0 The President is saying that Senator Landrieu\xe2\x80\x99s approach and Congressman Upton\xe2\x80\x99s approach, which is gaining some Democratic sponsors, is in his view the wrong approach to resolve the problem of those who got transition letters in the individual market.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I would tell you is that the Upton bill allows insurers to sell 2013 plans in 2014 to anyone.\xc2\xa0 It does not just continue 2013 plans in 2014 for people enrolled in those plans.\xc2\xa0 That creates the problem that I just described, and creates all sorts of problems for insurers who are trying to sell plans that meet the basic standards.\xc2\xa0 And it allows those insurers who would sell those 2013 plans that either charge you double or put caps on benefits, or do any of a number of things that make those plans insufficient when it comes to basic coverage, and basically sell them to any takers.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, if the coverage is substandard, they would at least potentially be able to undersell those plans and undermine the basic premise of the Affordable Care Act, which is to provide basic benefits for affordable, quality health insurance for everyone.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the same would be the case for the Senate --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the details on that.\xc2\xa0 I would just say that, broadly speaking, that applies to the Upton legislation, that broadly speaking that -- we do not see that as fixing the problem, we see that as throwing the baby out with the bathwater.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one practical follow-up.\xc2\xa0 You were talking earlier about the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to find an option that would be effective.\xc2\xa0 You know that this population of people, however small it may be, have until practically December 15th, relatively speaking, to try to find new insurance January 1.\xc2\xa0 Some people have suggested that even if the President had the legal authority to expand the subsidies -- in other words, to change the income levels -- if he were able to do that through executive action, that would have to be programmed in to healthcare.gov and new software would have to be written, new coding, all that.\xc2\xa0 As part of the effective, is the President open to the idea of any kind of option that would change healthcare.gov in the next month?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Alexis, I think those and other questions are excellent, but I will stick to what I said before, which is I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to describe or get into detail about the specific options available to the President that his team is working on.\xc2\xa0 Once the President reviews those options and makes some decisions, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an announcement for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me move around a little.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0 The President, when he was interviewed by Chuck Todd, talked about how federal regulations guided the website construction.\xc2\xa0 Are federal regulations prohibiting a new -- a totally new creation, a whole new website to kind of eradicate what\xe2\x80\x99s going on now and just bring out something new before the 30th, or on the 30th of November?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what he was saying, but for more details about the regulations that govern the creation of a federal website, I would have to refer you to CMS to start, because they obviously take the lead on this one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think that there are issues with, as the President discussed in his interview, federal IT programs that have been a persistent problem.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a related but bigger issue that I know concerns the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0 Does this White House now wish they would have followed some of the conversations and the guides from some leaders on Capitol Hill who suggested that you do not focus primarily on the website -- use more navigators, more phone, more grassroots help to get people involved in or enrolled in the ACA?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s always been part of the effort, the broad effort to get information to people, help educate people about the options available to them and the benefits available to them.\xc2\xa0 It was never just limited to the website.\xc2\xa0 I think what the President believes is that the website should be working more effectively and should have been working more effectively on October 1st.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important portal through which Americans across the country should be able to and will be able to get information that they need and enroll in affordable insurance plans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0 In the initial offering on October 1st, you had momentum there, you had everyone looking at it.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost that momentum now that there are so many glitches and it\xe2\x80\x99s found out that there\xe2\x80\x99s been low enrollment?\xc2\xa0 Do you think you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost that momentum for people --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that this has created a challenge.\xc2\xa0 And we have to work even harder to make sure that those Americans who have benefits available to them through the Affordable Care Act and through the marketplaces are getting the information they need so that they can make decisions about their insurance coverage.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s on us, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working hard to make sure that happens.</p>\n<p>The goal here has always been not an effective website so much as an effective marketplace for Americans to get the quality, affordable health insurance that they deserve.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it is -- the criticism of the website is legitimate, it is a problem, it is frustrating, and the President is more frustrated than anyone about it, as he has said.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he has tasked this team of experts to make the fixes necessary to bring it up to standard.</p>\n<p>It is important throughout this to remember what the status quo looks like; to remember what the health insurance marketplace looked like in the United States and why a century of Presidents engaged in efforts to try to reform it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, health care inflation was astronomical and increasing at a rate that made it unsustainable for employers and individuals and for the government in the long term.\xc2\xa0 Something needed to be done and is being done to bring that cost growth under control.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And do not forget that even as we have these challenges with the website and other challenges associated with the standing up of the marketplaces, that since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the three years of slowest growth in health care costs ever recorded, essentially in a half a century.\xc2\xa0 And that has extreme benefits for the long term -- for individuals, for the government, and for private employers.\xc2\xa0 And in the meantime, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get the website right and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get the marketplaces right, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure that the goal here is achieved, which is to deliver the benefits to the American people that the Affordable Care Act promises.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And if we do that -- and millions of Americans who were not insured have insurance, and other Americans who were underinsured who had crummy insurance have better coverage -- then we will have achieved the objective.\xc2\xa0 Because coupled with the reduction in the growth of health care costs and the expansion of affordable, quality insurance to the American people, we will have achieved what the Affordable Care Act set out to do and what this President set out to do, and against some pretty entrenched establishment interests here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\'s a reason why it hasn\'t been achieved in the past -- because a lot of forces fought against it.\xc2\xa0 And citing President Clinton is absolutely appropriate, and it\'s important to remember that he tried this.\xc2\xa0 He tried to reform our health insurance market, and that effort was blocked.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the American people deserve quality, affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 They deserve the certainty of knowing that they will not go bankrupt because they get sick.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the goal here.\xc2\xa0 The implementation of this website is not meeting anybody\'s standards here and we admit that.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s a problem and we\'re fixing it.\xc2\xa0 But don\'t forget the goal.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t forget the objective.</p>\n<p>Julianna.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House announced today the President is going to Cleveland on Thursday to deliver a speech on the economy.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any more details of what exactly he is going to be --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure we will provide more details as we get closer to the day.\xc2\xa0 The President, obviously, is very focused on the steps we need to take to continue the economic growth that we\'ve seen and to expand it -- to continue the creation of high-quality jobs for the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'ve been creating jobs at a pace of more than 2 million a year.\xc2\xa0 We need to keep doing that as an economy and to increase that pace, because -- and that\'s his number-one objective here.\xc2\xa0 His top priority when he wakes up every morning is what steps are we taking to make the investments that are necessary to create the jobs that we need to make the middle class more secure and to have our economy grow.</p>\n<p>And I think that it\'s important to remember, as we talk about bigger budget issues, that growth and job creation are the President\'s focus.\xc2\xa0 On his watch, we\'ve reduced the deficits by half.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t forget that when he came into office -- and this is before the passage of the Affordable -- or the American Recovery Act -- he inherited the largest deficits in history and a cascading economic catastrophe.\xc2\xa0 And in order to forestall a depression, legislation was passed that included some temporary spending that increased even more the deficit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the fact is, on his watch, the deficits have been cut in half.\xc2\xa0 And we need to continue that work, but we need to focus, first and foremost, on growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Alberta Premier, Alison Redford, is here in town to lobby for the Keystone Pipeline.\xc2\xa0 Is she going to be meeting with anyone here at the White House?\xc2\xa0 And can you characterize the President\'s thinking after all this time?\xc2\xa0 Is he leaning for or against the pipeline?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any meetings to announce and/or any new developments on that issue, which is housed and being addressed over at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 And I would refer you to them for any progress reports.</p>\n<p>I\'ll do one more.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in light of President Clinton\'s comments, a year ago he was being called the "secretary of explaining stuff" by the President.\xc2\xa0 Is he still a metatron for the President\'s policies on health care?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I would point you to the answers I gave in the seven or eight previous questions to this along these lines, and simply say that President Clinton said something that, as the explainer-in-chief, he would know, which is that the big lesson, and I quote, is that, "We are better off with this law than without it."\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that goes to what I was saying in answer to April\'s question.\xc2\xa0 The goal here is to achieve what President Clinton and Presidents both Democratic and Republican sought to achieve in the past, which is to reform our health care system in a way that builds on the private sector system that we have, that makes it more affordable, with better coverage, for more Americans.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the Affordable Care Act does, and it does it while reducing health care cost inflation, which has enormous benefits to our overall economy.</p>\n<p>So the President himself addressed the issue of cancellations in the interview he gave last week, and I would point you to what he said.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the spirit of what President Clinton was saying today.</p>\n<p>But President Clinton knows from experience.\xc2\xa0 And some of the same folks who fought him tooth and nail successfully in the end are still in Congress fighting the Affordable Care Act today.\xc2\xa0 And they didn\'t then and they don\'t now have an alternative.\xc2\xa0 They do not have an alternative to the Affordable Care Act that would make sure that you have coverage even if you have a preexisting condition; that would make sure that insurers can\'t charge you double if you\'re a woman; that would provide free preventive services that are so essential to the long-term health of the nation and to every individual who benefits from them.</p>\n<p>So this is tough work, but the goal here is what the President remains focused on.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much, everybody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the House doesn\'t take up and pass ENDA, is the President going to sign the executive order?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we believe very strongly -- I appreciate the question -- that the time to pass that legislation has come, that those who oppose passage of ENDA in the House and throw up a lot of reasons why, the reasons they cite are reasons that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard in the past in opposition to seminal civil rights legislation.\xc2\xa0 And those who oppose previous civil rights legislation were wrong, and history has proved them wrong.\xc2\xa0 And those who oppose passage of ENDA are wrong, and history will prove them wrong.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>2:05 P.M EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
