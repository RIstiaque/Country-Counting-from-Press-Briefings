EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you all.\xc2\xa0 Get set up here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll let that be my topper and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President said that the talks were very constructive but also that they\xe2\x80\x99re -- the sides are still far apart on a range of issues.\xc2\xa0 Can you offer any detail at all about what progress was made specifically?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We are committing --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I could end there if you like.\xc2\xa0 There is a commitment among the folks in the room, as there was a commitment among the folks in the room when the Vice President was leading those negotiations, not to read out the content and the specifics of these meetings -- not because there\xe2\x80\x99s an interest in secrecy or hiding or anything like that, but because it preserves an environment that allows real progress to be made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is why the President just now did not get into specifics and why I will not get into specifics.\xc2\xa0 There was a constructive tenor set.\xc2\xa0 As the President said, he felt that participants came in the spirit of compromise, but, as he said, there are significant differences that remain on key issues. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why staffs will work over the next 48 hours very hard, why leaders will be talking among themselves; members will be talking among themselves.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking with senior folks over here, including the President and the Vice President, probably.\xc2\xa0 But the content and specifics of this meeting and others we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to read out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple others, please.\xc2\xa0 You put out a statement earlier that suggested there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing really new in terms of the role of Social Security in this debate, going back to what the President said in the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 But one detail that does seem to be new is the possibility of changing the way cost of living increases are laid out, changing the inflation measure and it could result in smaller increases.\xc2\xa0 Is that not the case?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just be clear, as I think I tried to be in the statement I gave to all of you.\xc2\xa0 This story is really not new at all.\xc2\xa0 The President has -- in fact, it essentially was written back when the President delivered his State of the Union address and he talked about his openness to doing things to strengthen Social Security, things that would not slash benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he also made very clear that we do not believe -- and a lot of independent economists back up our contention -- that Social Security is an issue in the near- and medium-term deficit.\xc2\xa0 So when you talk about deficit reduction, dealing with the issues that have been before us in these negotiations for these many weeks, Social Security is not a factor. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it also remains true, as he made clear in the State of the Union, that he is willing to and thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s important to talk about the long-term strength of Social Security.\xc2\xa0 And it is also true, as he has made clear -- and the Vice President and others -- that they have created an atmosphere -- or tried to -- an environment, in the negotiations that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had where everybody, every participant, feels that he or she can bring to the room issues that they think are important.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we mean by -- when we say everything is on the table.\xc2\xa0 But it does not mean that the President\xe2\x80\x99s position has changed at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking about that one --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking about a specific that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear from what I have been willing to say, and clear from the position the President enunciated at his State of the Union address and I just reiterated here, that we do not believe, and we think there is ample economic evidence to back this up, that Social Security is really an issue when we talk about our near- and medium-term deficits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other.\xc2\xa0 Can you update us on the deadline that the parties are working under, not the August 2nd debt limit but the real deadline to get this done, in particular because this meeting happening on Sunday -- I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why they\xe2\x80\x99re meeting on Sunday as opposed to Monday or some other date.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that reflects the sense of urgency that everyone shares.\xc2\xa0 As the President said, there is a recognition in the room that while we have to make sure the United States does not default on its obligations, that deadline, as you said, is August 2nd.\xc2\xa0 You have to work back from there -- and this is a little bit of an imprecise science -- but you have to work back from there to allow for what it would take to write and pass legislation that would take care of this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So without putting a date on it, we\xe2\x80\x99re in the end game here because of the absolute August 2nd deadline that does represent the point at which the United States could default on its obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Caren.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is July 22nd still the date that you\xe2\x80\x99re --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that was -- again, I think I just explained this, that is an imprecise -- this is working back from an August 2nd date, recognizing the way that Congress works and the pace at which it works, even under duress, that there needs to be some time to produce a product and pass it.\xc2\xa0 So I think this was a date that emerged in the context of a rough estimate of what it would take.\xc2\xa0 This is not -- the 22nd is not a hard deadline, but it is an assertion of the recognition that obviously it all can\xe2\x80\x99t happen on August 2nd.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Social Security, you said that the President\xe2\x80\x99s position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed from what he said in the State of the Union, but what is new is that this might be a part of the talks.\xc2\xa0 So are you confirming that it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the talks now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I simply said is that the President and the Vice President in the negotiations that they have led have created an environment, quite consciously, that allows for anyone, any participant who\xe2\x80\x99s there in good faith, to bring to the table any issue that he or she thinks is relevant or important.\xc2\xa0 And that means bringing the House Republican plan to the table.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are elements of that that we simply categorically disagree with, but the Ryan plan was brought to the table.\xc2\xa0 There are elements of the President\xe2\x80\x99s framework that Republicans disagree with, but we brought that to the table.\xc2\xa0 Simpson-Bowles, Rivlin-Domenici, Gang of Six ideas, that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what we mean.\xc2\xa0 So to use terminology is -- different things, part of the talks are on the table -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- we have not ruled anything out as an issue to talk about.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the position that the President takes or the limits beyond which he will not go on any issue of significance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just on the progress that he said was made, was there a specific breakthrough at this meeting that has made you optimistic, or was the real progress made over the weekend that laid the groundwork for this?\xc2\xa0 Where are things now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, there has been a lot of work going on for weeks now, represented in large part by the Biden negotiations; also, in obviously meetings between staffs and consultations between various folks.\xc2\xa0 This was another step in that process, an important step to bring the eight leaders of Congress here in a meeting with the President and the Vice President to further these discussions.\xc2\xa0 Because in the end, obviously, something that has to go through Congress has to have all the leaders engaged.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- again, going back to what I said to Ben, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics but I can say that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a specific breakthrough that happened today, but there was a constructive atmosphere and a recognition that we all need to continue working towards this.\xc2\xa0 And that is why there will be work done in the next several days and then the President will have the same group back on Sunday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House -- White House officials have repeatedly said that this cannot pass the House with just Republican votes; it needs Democratic votes as well.\xc2\xa0 What outreach has President Obama done?\xc2\xa0 What conversations has he had with Democratic leaders in terms of trying to get their rank and file onboard with whatever --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, he met with the Democratic caucus in the House, the Democratic caucus in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 He has had regular conversations with the leaders of both houses in the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 And those continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what has he told -- in terms of assurances, in terms of their concern about being reelected if they vote for a plan that cuts benefits for --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has told them exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s told you and the American people about the need -- the greater good here that needs to be reached for, which is significant agreement on deficit reduction created by an opportunity that does not come very often and has not come in Washington since the mid-\xe2\x80\x9990s, and that that is good for America, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for Democrats and it\xe2\x80\x99s good for Republicans, and that we ought to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, really, the message is not very complicated.\xc2\xa0 The issues here have been substantive and not political because this is really a case where good policy is good politics. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m also wondering if you have any response to the fact that one of the leading Republican presidential candidates, Michele Bachmann, who is a member of Congress and will vote on this, who has said that she will not vote to raise the debt ceiling, that that is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There may be other members who feel that way.\xc2\xa0 We obviously disagree strongly and think that it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- it would be a mistake not to do that because we are talking here about the United States of America defaulting on its obligations for the first time in its history.\xc2\xa0 The consequences of that -- as Ronald Reagan believed, as President Obama believes -- would be significant and unpredictable and in no way positive.\xc2\xa0 They would definitely be negative.\xc2\xa0 The question is just how seriously negative, and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s ample evidence to suggest that it would be quite serious. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.\xc2\xa0 Oh, sorry.\xc2\xa0 Okay. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this my order?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 How are you?\xc2\xa0 Are you -- yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my first.\xc2\xa0 This is my order.\xc2\xa0 Can I ask, strategically, why the administration believes it\xe2\x80\x99s feasible to get a $4 trillion deal done in two weeks when you\xe2\x80\x99ve been unable to negotiate a $2 trillion deal in more than two months?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re making assumptions about numbers that are not ones that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to concede.\xc2\xa0 We think -- we have said that a big deal is possible and should be sought and reached for, and by a big deal we mean in the range of the roughly $4 trillion in deficit reduction that the President put forward over 10 to 12 years; that the budget that emerged from the House from the Republicans put forward -- Simpson-Bowles, Domenici-Rivlin, et cetera, Gang of Six -- that that is the context of a big deal.\xc2\xa0 How close it gets to $4 million [sic] is not really the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to answer your question why does -- something big doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen until the end.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way these things always work.\xc2\xa0 We have made very clear that because of the consequences of even approaching the August 2nd deadline that Congress should not postpone final action on this until right up until the deadline.\xc2\xa0 But these are hard issues.\xc2\xa0 So, as the Vice President has said and the President said again just now, this is a situation where nothing is agreed upon until everything is agreed upon.\xc2\xa0 So no matter how large the size of savings in an agreement, that would be true if you were at one penny short of $2 trillion or one penny short of $4 trillion.\xc2\xa0 It would not come together until the very end.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the atmosphere, the constructive atmosphere more constructive with the big deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that there is an appreciation within Congress that this is an opportunity and that there is something transcendent about the possibility of achieving significant deficit reduction that makes the achievement of the kind of deficit reduction and fiscally responsible measures that makes the pain involved for everyone that a compromise would represent more tolerable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You would not want to give on an issue that is hard for you as a Republican or a Democrat if the reward is not significant.\xc2\xa0 And the reward here for both parties is the opportunity to significantly reduce the deficit, send the message that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting our fiscal house in order, and providing, therefore, the confidence in the American economy that will help us grow faster and create jobs faster.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the reward that everyone seeks here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the price for that reward is the willingness to compromise and move off of your starting position, to accept the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get 100 percent of what you want.\xc2\xa0 The plan you came to the table with will not be the plan that you leave the table with.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that is what the President has asked every participant to acknowledge and accept, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I think he feels pleased with the tone in the room today -- recognizing, as he did, that there are significant differences, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to ignore that fact.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to be resolved.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said -- you said, the President, and everybody says -- almost everybody says that everything has got to be on the table.\xc2\xa0 But just this morning John Boehner said everything is on the table except raising taxes on the American people.\xc2\xa0 Are they still -- were they still that intransigent in there?\xc2\xa0 And is there any reason to believe that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to back down from that hard position?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics about what went on in the room, but I think that there is -- there was a constructive atmosphere.\xc2\xa0 A lot has been said and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to interpret the words of a member of Congress, except to say that everyone recognizes that a significant deal cannot pass this Congress that does not have a balance -- that does not take a balanced approach. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to achieve something significant requires balance, requires an acknowledgment in fact and in deed -- or an acknowledgment not just in word, rather, but in deed that savings has to come -- will have to come from discretionary spending; cuts in programs, in some cases that Democrats and the President will see as painful but necessary; cuts in defense spending that are significant but protect our national security; cuts in entitlement spending; savings that we can extract to reduce health care costs without putting the onus on seniors or the disabled; and cuts in tax spending.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way that you can plausibly get a big deal.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the only fair and responsible way.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the only way that you can get to a deal that will pass this Congress and be signed by this President if you want a deal that\xe2\x80\x99s significant in size.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the question -- so if they don\xe2\x80\x99t back off that position, there\xe2\x80\x99s no deal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, this -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of positioning that takes place -- and I mean this broadly, not in reference to a single member or a single statement -- and then there is the reality of what everyone recognizes has to take place in order to achieve a significant deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the tone, it was just yesterday that the President suggested the Republicans were using the debt limit as a gun to the head of the American people to expect tax breaks for corporate jets and with the oil and gas industry.\xc2\xa0 I take it his tone --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he suggested that some have that approach.\xc2\xa0 Those who would not vote to raise the debt ceiling either under any circumstance or without the success of their absolutist position, which is impossible -- therefore they won\xe2\x80\x99t vote to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 So that is in essence holding a gun to the head of the American people because make no mistake, the specific consequences of default may be unknowable or unpredictable, but we know they will be seriously negative and they will impact -- they will have an impact directly on the American people.\xc2\xa0 They will have an effect on growth, they will have an effect on job creation, they will have an effect on interest rates -- very quickly.\xc2\xa0 And the uncertainty created even by approaching that deadline will have negative consequences. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President meant.\xc2\xa0 I know that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President meant.\xc2\xa0 But that does not mean that -- I mean, the fact that some people hold that view or take that position does mean that a majority of Congress or even a majority of one party holds that view.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But were there -- last question.\xc2\xa0 Were there contentious or tense moments in there today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was a very constructive atmosphere. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just like in here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, actually, very collegial, very constructive.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 I can say there were no tense moments when I was in the room, and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in there the whole time, but not when I was in the room.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is everyone involved in the talks onboard with the \xe2\x80\x9cbig deal\xe2\x80\x9d concept now, the closer to $4 trillion rather than $2 trillion in deficit reduction?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize, again, how each -- you know, when you say \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone,\xe2\x80\x9d that\xe2\x80\x99s eight members plus the President and the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 So that would -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say that every member accepted a certain proposition.\xc2\xa0 I can simply say that there was a recognition that we need to work hard, we need to try to get to a big deal.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go -- we have some faith and confidence that everyone recognizes the importance of not reading out every detail of all of these meetings.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the general tone and sense that each participant has about the meeting, obviously they may have something to say about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, we\xe2\x80\x99ll move away from the meetings themselves and talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, which as I understand was $4 trillion over 12 years.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some criticism that the majority of the cuts are backloaded in the last two, so that a 10-year timeframe for the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal is unworkable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In what sense?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In that you would not even come close to the number of -- even half the $4 trillion over a 10-year period of time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been awhile since I had the details of the President\xe2\x80\x99s framework on the tip of my tongue, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s accurate, actually.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s framework represents $4 trillion in savings over 12 years.\xc2\xa0 There is significant savings in the President\xe2\x80\x99s framework in 10 years. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I had also said, I think, and I made quite clear, that nobody\xe2\x80\x99s framework, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s plan is going to be the plan that emerges.\xc2\xa0 No single plan -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s or the House Republican plan, or anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s -- is going to be the plan that emerges from these negotiations as the final product.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that he accepts the responsibility and the need to compromise and that he won\xe2\x80\x99t get everything that he wants, that he will have to make tough choices.\xc2\xa0 And he is calling on others to do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In your statement today about Social Security, you assured that benefits would not be cut.\xc2\xa0 And the House progressives spoke today and said it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a tough sell to seniors.\xc2\xa0 What don\xe2\x80\x99t they understand about the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on Social Security and addressing Social Security has been explicit since he uttered it in front of millions of viewers in the joint session of Congress at the State of the Union in January.\xc2\xa0 And that is the position that I repeated today in my statement, and that is the position he holds today. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason why I issued the statement is because there was a misperception created by some reporting about what -- like the idea that the President put forward some plan related to these talks affecting Social Security, and that\xe2\x80\x99s simply not the case.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position on Social Security is today what it was in January.\xc2\xa0 And I think the most important point to understand is that his position is the position held by many, and I would say most, credible economists that Social Security is not a contributor to our short- and medium-term deficit problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when you\xe2\x80\x99re building a plan to deal with our short- and medium-term deficit problem, Social Security is not an issue.\xc2\xa0 So when we talk about entitlement savings and the kinds that the President has put forward, in addition to the ones he found in the Affordable Care Act, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about savings from Medicare and Medicaid to the cost of health care, and not savings that put added burdens on beneficiaries.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why is it involved then?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You were here, right?\xc2\xa0 I just went through this where we have said that everything -- any issue that any participant in these negotiations who is there in good faith -- and we believe they have been there in good faith -- wants to bring into the room for discussion and to raise, they are welcome to do so.\xc2\xa0 Just -- but that does not make them viable options for an outcome or something that the President is going to agree to or necessarily other members might agree to.\xc2\xa0 But we have not put restrictions on what can be brought into the room or put on the table to use the variety of sort of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess with the deadline looming, the suggestion is the only things on the table are things that will pay benefits toward the goal you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to achieve.\xc2\xa0 If Social Security is not a significant contributor --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President put forward a plan with $480 billion in savings in Medicare and Medicaid over 12 years that does not overly burden seniors but finds savings in the cost of health care.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s simply not the case.\xc2\xa0 And the savings that are represented in the Affordable Care Act are savings that Republicans want to gather as well.\xc2\xa0 So -- and those do not represent -- do not cause harm to seniors or to beneficiaries.\xc2\xa0 So I reject that premise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to harp on this, but how is this not a policy change?\xc2\xa0 The President specifically said it should not be included, and then now you guys are acknowledging it\xe2\x80\x99s included in the talks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has said since January that he is willing and eager to have discussions about Social Security --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not -- but he always -- was specific to say not connected to this stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has always said that it is not connected to the short- and medium-term deficit problems that we face as a nation.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that he\xe2\x80\x99s not willing to talk about, as a separate matter, as he has made clear since January, the need to strengthen Social Security in the long term in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t slash benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is it a separate matter today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But what he has also said -- and, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make too much about what people seem to think has been going on in the room.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m hamstrung a little bit by the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to discuss details.\xc2\xa0 But sometimes there are sources for stories that -- people who source stories have agendas.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the President\xe2\x80\x99s position has not changed at all since January.\xc2\xa0 He has also said that anybody who wants to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there is no deal that comes out of this that\xe2\x80\x99s going to include Social Security?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize what would be in or out of a deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that was the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, you could -- if somebody felt it was very important to talk about -- go abstract so nobody thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m -- some policy that had nothing to do with even economic -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not excluding things from the room.\xc2\xa0 But what doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change is the fact that Social Security is not a driver of our short- and medium-term deficits; that when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a deficit reduction plan, it is addressing just that and trying to glean up to $4 trillion of savings over 10 to 12 years.\xc2\xa0 Social Security is not a player in that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if it\xe2\x80\x99s included in the final deal, then it\xe2\x80\x99s a policy change?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fair?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not even suggesting that it will be.\xc2\xa0 But it depends on -- like you can attach -- you could attach anything to this that may not have anything to do with dealing with our short- or medium-term deficit.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that this will be.\xc2\xa0 Again, I want to make clear there is no news in the story that pretended to be news this morning.\xc2\xa0 But the -- (laughter) -- \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s not even here to defend herself.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are headline writers, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, let me ask -- there is an empty chair.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there is an empty chair for the organization that produced that story.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was confused by something.\xc2\xa0 The President said Sunday was about coming in with your bottom lines; that that\xe2\x80\x99s what everybody has got to come back to.\xc2\xa0 So that implies that nobody had their bottom line today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, this group has not met, at least not recently, on this issue, and it was important for this meeting to take place as a way to move the process forward.\xc2\xa0 This was not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This was a surprise?\xc2\xa0 Nobody came prepared for a bottom line today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not getting into details in the meetings.\xc2\xa0 And I go back to what I said yesterday -- people are very aware of what the parameters of the discussion is here, when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about how do we reduce our deficit significantly over 10 to a dozen years, and how we need to do that in what we think is a balanced way, in a way that can actually pass Congress and be signed into law, and how we need to make sure that the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t default on its obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So obviously there have been a lot of discussions up to this point -- there have been the Biden negotiations and obviously other discussions -- so there is an understanding of where we stand, what the issues are.\xc2\xa0 But what did not happen here was any sort of "this is as far as I will go on this," or "this is as far as I will go on that."\xc2\xa0 There was --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re asking --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There was a discussion -- no -- there was a discussion of the various issues and the fact that -- and it was established what people knew, which is that there are differences, significant in some cases, in a variety of areas.\xc2\xa0 And the President is inviting -- or asking, and participants are willingly accepting, the charge that we need to go back over the next several days and work on these issues and then for these participants to come back on Sunday to move these discussions even further down the road.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m just confused by the President\xe2\x80\x99s use of \xe2\x80\x9cbottom line.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t have it today, and the expectation is on Sunday they better have it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t improve upon his words.\xc2\xa0 I think he did expect that people will have bottom lines on Sunday, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on that sort of point.\xc2\xa0 Will the staffs of the eight leaders and White House staff tasked with driving towards $4 trillion -- is there a number -- I mean, is that what they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to do between now and Sunday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get hung up on a specific number, just because this is a bit like a jigsaw puzzle, and to go to the context of what\xe2\x80\x99s in the room and what\xe2\x80\x99s not and how you -- if the puzzle is 60 pieces but there are 100 pieces on the table, and you have to find the pieces that all fit together and then add them up, if they all have values, and whether that\xe2\x80\x99s -- what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for here is a significant deal that goes significantly beyond sort of the lower dollar figures that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about and gets you in the range of, not necessarily hitting or precisely -- slightly below, slightly below -- but gets you in the range of what everyone has talked about as a significant deal.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say that if it\xe2\x80\x99s a few dollars short of this or a few dollars over that we\xe2\x80\x99ve missed a target, because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific dollar target.\xc2\xa0 Bigness is our target.\xc2\xa0 Comprehensiveness and balance are our targets. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in the next 48 hours, does the President plan to do anything personally to reach out to Democrats and sort of walk them to and bring them along --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He will participate and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure have discussions with folks involved in this process. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that you can already announce?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing on his schedule to announce to you.\xc2\xa0 But I think he said that everybody in that room will be engaged in this in the two days before we get to Sunday, and then obviously in the meeting on Sunday. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he see that as part of his job to -- as leader of the party to bring the party along?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 To talk to -- he sees it as part of his job as President to talk to lawmakers on both sides and also obviously to talk to Democrats, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when the President says there will be political pain involved, can you tell us what -- will it be equally distributed pain --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What medications might alleve the pain?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any medication that will alleviate the pain?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Alleviate the pain, rather, or relieve the pain.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about pain can sometimes be psychological and not physical.\xc2\xa0 And it can be perceived pain.\xc2\xa0 And every politician knows his or her own politics best.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not for him to say, or the Vice President or others, to tell one member -- one elected official what he or she can tolerate. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What they can say is that everybody should be willing to accept some discomfort, if you will, so that everyone has some skin in the game, everyone is willing to move off of their desired position, their perfect outcome, and accept a less-than-perfect outcome because it will result in a bigger deal.\xc2\xa0 And then that then alleviates some of the pain because Americans I think overwhelmingly expect Washington to work for them and they\xe2\x80\x99re more concerned about that then they are about the specific issues that animate different constituencies and the two parties.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So back to Social Security, just to be clear, you said the President wants to strengthen Social Security, but the CBO said that changing the inflation adjustment measure would reduce spending on Social Security by 1.2 percent over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 So I just want to be clear, how is it strengthening it?\xc2\xa0 Why is it still on the table if indeed it would actually reduce Social Security benefits?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re making assumptions about what\xe2\x80\x99s being discussed here that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to acknowledge by answering the question without prefacing it the way I just did.\xc2\xa0 But I will go back -- I mean, I could have taken this question three months ago in relation to the President\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 We do not think Social Security is -- and there\xe2\x80\x99s ample evidence to back us up here -- that Social Security is a driver of our near- and medium-term deficit problems.\xc2\xa0 As with all of these entitlement programs, there are issues in terms of long-long-term strength.\xc2\xa0 And the President is interested in strengthening Social Security for the long term in ways that preserve the promise of the program and don\xe2\x80\x99t slash benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about preserving and enhancing its long-term solvency in ways that do not -- that preserve the integrity of the program and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t slash benefits.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that -- you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into line items and how you achieve that and not -- again, and not answering this question in the context of what is or isn\xe2\x80\x99t on the table in these negotiations, but just as a matter of fact, in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s position that he took in the State of the Union address lo these many months ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the inflation adjustment measure is off the table because it would slash benefits, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about individual items about the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy that he enunciated back in January.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And will eligibility age and other parts of Social Security be on the table?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- look, again, broadly, without addressing the specific question, the President and the Vice President created an environment in these negotiations where they have asked -- told everybody that they -- that there are no preconditions about what you can or can\xe2\x80\x99t bring into the room and raise for discussion, on the presumption that you\xe2\x80\x99re there in good faith to talk about issues that you think are important as part of this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- it does not behoove us to say something is on or off the table, something can or cannot come into the room.\xc2\xa0 But what gets into the room doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily emerge from the room.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does \xe2\x80\x9cslash\xe2\x80\x9d mean?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you got, like, a dictionary app on your iPhone?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a word that you use instead of \xe2\x80\x9ccut.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cSlash\xe2\x80\x9d is, I think, quite clear.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s slash.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s like that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a significant whack.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it means a significant --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to put a numerical figure on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it means a significant cut.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think slashing is a pretty sharp, direct --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the same thing as cutting -- the point is, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same thing as \xe2\x80\x9ccut.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s slash.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean the guitarist.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A pledge to not slash benefits is not the same thing as a pledge to not cut benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- again, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a policy enunciated by the President back in January, and that is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a diction you guys have chosen. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I get that, and we did choose it, and the President used it.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to negotiate the semantics --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just so everybody understands -- just so everybody understands, when you say \xe2\x80\x9cslash,\xe2\x80\x9d you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean \xe2\x80\x9ccut.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have said that to address the long-term solvency of the problem -- of the program, because this is not an issue that drives short- or medium-term deficits, that we would look -- the President is interested in looking at ways to strengthen the program and enhance its long-term solvency that protects the integrity of the program and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t slash benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which is not the same thing as not cutting benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I have a clarification?\xc2\xa0 You keep saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s in the talks because anybody can bring anything up.\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting Social Security is a topic of the conversation not because the President made it one but because somebody else did?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I just say that I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to talk about the contents of the conversation.\xc2\xa0 All I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is the story today way overwrote a simple fact that has been true since January, which is the President is willing to and interested in talking about ways to strengthen Social Security in the long term, and then separately but in a related way, because of the nature of the story, we have also not put any bars on the door to -- that disallow issues that people want to bring into the room.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a clarification, is the staff of all eight members going to be part of the staff talks leading up to Sunday, or is it a smaller group than that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a manifest for -- and there\xe2\x80\x99s not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not like one group meeting as far as I know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is a more fluid and evolving thing, but I would imagine that staff members who, either because of their expertise or who they work for, will be involved beyond even the members in that room.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then totally unrelated to the debt talks, tomorrow is the sixth [sic] anniversary of the Tucson shootings and gun control groups are upset that there\xe2\x80\x99s no action to prevent such an event from happening in the future.\xc2\xa0 Why not?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President directed the Attorney General to form working groups with key stakeholders to identify common-sense measures that would improve Americans\xe2\x80\x99 safety and security while fully respecting Second Amendment rights.\xc2\xa0 That process is well underway at the Department of Justice with stakeholders on all sides working through these complex issues.\xc2\xa0 And we expect to have some more specific announcements in the near future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any definition of near future?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The New York Times -- oh, there you are.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I -- and I apologize if this was asked, I was filing a few minutes ago -- if you were going -- to reach the kind of -- and let\xe2\x80\x99s leave numbers out -- to reach the kind of large package that the President desires, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need a level of revenues that most economists say is impossible to achieve without fundamental reform of the tax code.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask whether you agree with that.\xc2\xa0 And then secondly, if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, do you foresee a deal where you reach some level of revenues that everyone agrees on next week, but agree that the broader tax reform, a process that will take a long time, will have to be handled later and hence much of the future tax revenues you don\xe2\x80\x99t really have in this deal that you reach next week, that\xe2\x80\x99s to be worked out in the coming months?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me start with the second question and then go to the first.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics about what may or may not be part of the specific negotiations related to a significant deficit reduction package.\xc2\xa0 I will contest the premise -- even though I\xe2\x80\x99m not an economist -- because I will point you to the framework the President laid out, which did not -- which did achieve savings, significant savings, out of the tax code without the kind of sweeping tax reform that you talk about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I understand that not everything that the President wants or every approach that he takes is going to be accepted by the larger group, and that\xe2\x80\x99s true for everybody at the table.\xc2\xa0 But I just think that the premise is not entirely correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but just let me point out, I mean, David Plouffe I think appeared at a Bloomberg breakfast and raised tax reform as a possible scenario here.\xc2\xa0 So I think the White House appears to be open to that scenario.\xc2\xa0 And if it does happen, that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen over the next two weeks, it happens over a period of several months.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- again, you\xe2\x80\x99re correct, and David -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to further elaborate on what David said.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly true that tax reform can\xe2\x80\x99t be done in two weeks.\xc2\xa0 But there are a variety of ways to skin a cat here, and going back to my jigsaw puzzle analogy, there are different -- and some of those pieces are identical in shape; they just have different images on them and you can make them work and get to a big significant package.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to favor or disfavor any element that may or may not be part of a negotiation because these things can change regularly and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudice the outcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Connie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any evidence that North Korea has been bribing Pakistan to get nuclear technology? And also, how concerned is the President over this security surgical implant situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I addressed the issue of the warnings that TSA -- or the notifications that TSA made to foreign air carriers -- air carriers and our foreign partners yesterday, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add on that in terms of that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on Pakistan, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say beyond the fact that we take obviously North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program very seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. trying to buy Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s friendship and have we succeeded?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said on many occasions, Connie, that our relationship with Pakistan is complicated.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t always agree, it is not always perfect, but it is significant and important.\xc2\xa0 And it is significant and important because it helps us protect the United States of America, protect United States citizens and assets abroad, as well as our allies, and that Pakistan has been an important partner in our effort to disrupt, dismantle and ultimately defeat al Qaeda and continues to be so.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we continue to work on that relationship. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is bigness an important value here?\xc2\xa0 If the stakes are so high and the deadline is so close, why not reasonableness or why not -- you know, doing what\xe2\x80\x99s feasible? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the reasonable thing to do here -- reasonableness and bigness walk down the street hand-in-hand here because the -- (laughter) --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s quite an image.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know they were dating.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 TMZ.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But seriously, the reasonable thing to do here is be willing to accept less than your ideal outcome, because you acknowledge that the only possible outcome if you hope to achieve something significant is a compromise. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And bigness is important because the opportunity to do something this significant does not present itself very often.\xc2\xa0 The stars, in some ways, have aligned here because of the circumstances of the economy, the dynamic in Washington, the recognition by members of both parties that -- of what the problem is in a very real sense. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not -- often you get a situation here where one side thinks something is a very, very important issue and a big problem that needs to be solved, and the other side doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even accept the premise that there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s just not the case here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We saw this last in the mid-\xe2\x80\x9990s when a Democratic President and a Republican House and Senate were able to come together and achieve significant deficit reduction and actually a balanced budget that created -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go down memory lane here -- that created significant surpluses, surpluses as far as the eye could see and that disappeared in the previous decade -- or in the decade after that, rather -- because of some decisions made to put a lot of stuff on the credit card without paying for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And now we\xe2\x80\x99re in the situation where we have very significant deficits, growing deficits, and a much larger debt.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to deal with that and we have the opportunity to deal with it.\xc2\xa0 And the President feels very strongly that leaders were elected to lead.\xc2\xa0 And leading is not always a comfortable thing to do.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to tell everyone in your party or your constituency exactly what they want to hear.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s hard to do is to say, you know, we have to make tough choices and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do this because it serves the overall good.\xc2\xa0 In this case, the overall good is significant deficit reduction that strengthens our economy and helps us create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carrie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jack Lew -- I believe you and I think others --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Speaking of the mid-\xe2\x80\x9990s.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of the mid-\xe2\x80\x9990s -- have said that -- in regards to Social Security -- that that conversation had to happen on a parallel track because there was opposition to using anything from Social Security for deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 So if you consider, like, the adjustment to cost of living for Social Security beneficiaries, is there a commitment or desire by the President to make sure that money is kept to shore up Social Security, not as part of the broader package?\xc2\xa0 Is that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a well-put question, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go down the road any further in discussing a hypothetical about what strengthening the Social Security program might look like if that were indeed addressed in any near time period.\xc2\xa0 The President is interested in doing that for the reasons I\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out.\xc2\xa0 We feel very strongly and have a lot of economic evidence to back it up that it is not an issue when it comes to our near- and medium-term deficits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So -- but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean he\xe2\x80\x99s not interested in doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you agree, though, that that would be a shift by the administration, though, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t adhere to what your top aides have been saying for months, that it needs to be parallel and not used for deficit reduction?\xc2\xa0 It seems like there\xe2\x80\x99s some --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there is an issue in terms of short- and medium-term deficit problems created by Social Security.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- but, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the specifics of what strengthening the Social Security program would look like any more than I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get into specifics of what the ultimate jigsaw puzzle when it comes together will look like, because the jigsaw masters are putting it together.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jon-Christopher.\xc2\xa0 How are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just great, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for asking.\xc2\xa0 A change of topic a little bit.\xc2\xa0 The President is sending a distinguished delegation to the Republic of South Sudan, including Ambassador Rice and Deputy -- excuse me, Donald Payne, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, et cetera, and many other distinguished individuals.\xc2\xa0 They will be there to attend a ceremony on Saturday to mark the birth of a new nation.\xc2\xa0 In light of the reports of violence perpetrated by the north on the south, how optimistic is the President that this new nation in its independence from the north will actually mean peace for the people and an end to the violence?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re very hopeful and we think that the peaceful transition to independence for South Sudan is a major milestone on the path to a more peaceful and prosperous future for both Sudan and South Sudan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that we call on a cessation of violence -- some of the violence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen recently.\xc2\xa0 But in the days and the months ahead, the leaders of Sudan and South Sudan will need to work together to prevent violence and ensure that any isolated incidents do not cause wider instability or threaten a peaceful future for the citizens of these new nations.\xc2\xa0 So we monitor these things but we do believe that this is a moment that\xe2\x80\x99s significant -- the creation of a new nation that creates the opportunity for a more peaceful and prosperous future for both nations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has this -- may I -- has this administration been involved in any of the talks regarding the U.N. peacekeeping groups that will stay on afterwards or throughout this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I would direct that to Ambassador Rice\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 We have been very engaged in this issue, so I would hazard a guess that the answer is yes, but I would not go with that.\xc2\xa0 I would check with our mission to the U.N.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Last one, Richard.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said that there was agreement on August 2 as a hard deadline in this meeting.\xc2\xa0 Is that considered new?\xc2\xa0 Had all the parties not agreed that August 2 should be it?\xc2\xa0 Is that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that all the parties in this -- in the room had not agreed to it, but, again, they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t all been in a room together and had that discussion.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that as a starting point everyone acknowledge that that was a hard deadline; that the analysts who do this at the Treasury Department are basing it on very hard data that they crunch and they analyze; and it\xe2\x80\x99s simply an inescapable fact that on August 2nd, without a vote to raise the debt ceiling, we will be in arrears.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on bigness, is the President no longer thinking that $2.4 trillion or something in that range would be a deal worth taking?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, there are things we can do.\xc2\xa0 There are outcomes we can do that would be an accomplishment, would represent an accomplishment.\xc2\xa0 But then there is something we could and should do, which is bigger, because it will represent a substantial achievement and accomplishment as opposed to a more modest one, and that the payoff for that in some ways is larger even than the increase numerically in the size of the package because of the confidence it instills -- the potential for a significant package to have a truly lasting impact on the size of our national debt as a ratio of GDP and that sort of thing.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not that something less than that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be achieved, it\xe2\x80\x99s that the President believes this opportunity has to be seized because something bigger can be achieved.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more quick one.\xc2\xa0 Just a last quick follow on Mark\xe2\x80\x99s question on taxes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, this is my last one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it possible that what you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at in terms of bigness is throwing tax reform in and not throwing the specific taxes in, that just like appropriations you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have some agreement on taxes but push all the details to the tax writing committees?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to what I said at the beginning that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the specifics of what may or may not be -- end up being negotiated.\xc2\xa0 I will say that there are lots of pieces to the puzzle, and some of them could be used and others may not be.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s in the puzzle today may not be in tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there are many ways to skin a cat. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
