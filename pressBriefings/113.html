EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Before we get started here, I wanted to introduce Brett McGurk. \xc2\xa0He is the President\xe2\x80\x99s Special Envoy to our Global Counter-ISIL Coalition. \xc2\xa0And he has prepared some materials to discuss with you today some of the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing on the ground against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. \xc2\xa0And then he\xe2\x80\x99s got a little time afterwards to take a handful of questions from all of you.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that before we go back to our regularly scheduled programming. \xc2\xa0So, Brett, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0So I thought what we\xe2\x80\x99d do -- I\xe2\x80\x99d take about 10 minutes to put you into the picture of what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing day to day in this very difficult, extraordinarily complex fight against ISIL. \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t overstate the complexity of this, and yet despite that, we now have some real traction against this very serious enemy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe define ISIL -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a global organization; that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve built a global coalition of 66 partners to combat it. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s really defined as the core in Iraq and Syria, the phony, self-proclaimed caliphate. \xc2\xa0There are then networks -- global networks, propaganda networks, foreign-fighter networks, financing networks -- so we\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of gotten a handle on those. And then affiliates, about eight of them around the world. \xc2\xa0Of course, Libya is one we\xe2\x80\x99re particularly concerned about, and we took some action there this week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat I wanted to focus on today, just about 10 minutes as an opening, is the core in Iraq and Syria, because there\xe2\x80\x99s been a great deal of focus on there. \xc2\xa0And, as the President has said, we have to defeat them in the core and show that this is not an expanding movement; it\xe2\x80\x99s actually a shrinking movement. \xc2\xa0And so to defeat them in the core is how you actually begin to unravel the entire global network, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun to see that now in some concrete ways.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s a map here, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go around very briefly, kind of clockwise, to describe what\xe2\x80\x99s happening and just how complex this is, and what we\xe2\x80\x99re working to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe number one, that is what we call the Manbij pocket. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s about a 98-kilometer strip of border with Turkey. \xc2\xa0It is the last remaining outlet of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s territory with the outside world. \xc2\xa0Turkey has done a very good job of beginning to close down that border, and the President spoke with President Erdogan earlier this week, and that was of course one of the topics of conversation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJust to situate this map real quick -- orange is areas that ISIL controls. \xc2\xa0Green are areas that they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost over the last 18 months, so you can see the constriction of the areas they used to control. \xc2\xa0And red are areas in which they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually made some gains. \xc2\xa0So just to the west of this number one is where they\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to push out, and we call that the Mar\xe2\x80\x99a line. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to push out there for about a year. \xc2\xa0We think we\xe2\x80\x99ve halted that flow. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the Russian air campaign in this part of the country has dramatically complicated the picture. \xc2\xa0The Russians, in working with the regime, have cut off the main supply corridor coming from Turkey into Aleppo. \xc2\xa0The Russians say that\xe2\x80\x99s to cut off the weapons corridor; it\xe2\x80\x99s actually primarily a humanitarian corridor. \xc2\xa0And this has really created a real humanitarian crisis. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also completely shaken up the situation north of there to the Turkish border. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the most complex areas of the map, which I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to talk about in more detail.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNumber two is Raqqa. \xc2\xa0Raqqa, of course, is their main headquarters. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s where we think most of the leaders are. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s where plots like Paris are planned and coordinated. \xc2\xa0And so, therefore, we are focused on eliminating the enemy in Raqqa every single day. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re doing airstrikes there constantly, but most importantly, not just the military part, we\xe2\x80\x99re fusing information from across the government and, most importantly, from across the coalition about what we know about this enemy -- about how it finances itself, how it communicates, how it funds itself. \xc2\xa0We know more now than we ever did before, and we\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to constrict its hold on Raqqa.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis dam just to the northwest, Tishreen Dam, that was the main roadway from Manbij to Raqqa. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s now sliced off. \xc2\xa0ISIL can no longer access that. \xc2\xa0And that was an operation by Syrian Kurds and Arabs about a month ago. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then, if I move to number three -- number three right now is the town of al-Shaddadi. \xc2\xa0Shaddadi, an operation, started about three or four days ago, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a very complex operation and it includes thousands of fighters -- I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into the specific numbers -- but about 40 percent of them are non-Kurds, 60 percent are Kurd.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen I was in Kobani a couple weeks ago, the main focus was in getting all these disparate groups together and putting them together to kind of consolidate with some coherence and mass to move on ISIL, particularly in Shaddadi. \xc2\xa0And if you think about it, the kind of metaphor we use, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of different groups that are kinds of shards of wood that want to fight ISIL; it\xe2\x80\x99s our job to try to pull them together not just in bundle but in a bat. \xc2\xa0And what you have going now towards Shaddadi is a baseball bat. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s Kurds, it\xe2\x80\x99s Arabs, it\xe2\x80\x99s Christians -- a number of forces with good command and control, good coordination with our air power, and they\xe2\x80\x99re having some real effect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut this is -- again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a military side, but what I\xe2\x80\x99m primarily focused on also is there\xe2\x80\x99s a politics to this -- who\xe2\x80\x99s going to govern a town like Shaddadi afterwards. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s primarily an Arab town, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely to make sure that locals are in control of that town once it\xe2\x80\x99s cleared of ISIL. \xc2\xa0So that is still ongoing. \xc2\xa0It will unfold over the coming days. \xc2\xa0So far, though, it\xe2\x80\x99s going fairly well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNumber four is Sinjar. \xc2\xa0Sinjar was the main connector between Raqqa and Mosul. \xc2\xa0And Shaddadi is the last piece of cutting off this connection between Raqqa and Mosul and making sure that they simply cannot travel those roads anymore. \xc2\xa0And so it\xe2\x80\x99s been Sinjar, Shaddadi, cutting off the connection between Raqqa and Mosul.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSinjar was for primarily Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. \xc2\xa0Sinjar is where ISIL really broke onto the international scene with everything we know about the Yazidis and the Yazidi slaves. \xc2\xa0In fact, they used to take their -- they would take these young women off Sinjar Mountain, collect them, separate them, and then bring them to Shaddadi to kind of trade them as slaves. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here is not only a military operation, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a moral imperative to take these areas from ISIL. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s one reason we\xe2\x80\x99re so focused on it. \xc2\xa0But Sinjar was very important because it cut off the main highway into Mosul.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to Mosul. \xc2\xa0Mosul, of course, everybody asks about -- when are we going to move on Mosul? \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t answer that question because we won\xe2\x80\x99t put a timeline on it. \xc2\xa0But Mosul is already started. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re already working to constrict it. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re pooling all of our information, intelligence, to basically learn more about them. \xc2\xa0Doing airstrikes into Mosul every single night based on that -- upon that intelligence. \xc2\xa0And again, most importantly, working the local politics. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m in constant touch with our ambassador on the ground in Baghdad, with our diplomats in the field up in Erbil. \xc2\xa0And then, again, taking these kind of shards of wood together and turning them into a baseball bat.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done for Mosul -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll see Makhmur on the map -- that\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99re setting up a joint -- a headquarters, pooling all of these fighters that are going to fight ISIL. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s Sunni tribes, it\xe2\x80\x99s local notables from Ninawa province, it\xe2\x80\x99s Iraqi Peshmerga, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the Iraqi army. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo in Munich last week, for example, I saw both President Barzani of the Kurdistan region and Prime Minister Abadi to sit together to talk about how are we going to deal with Mosul not only militarily, but also politically. \xc2\xa0That is something we\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on, and it\xe2\x80\x99s actually coming along fairly well.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll skip to seven, because seven is Tikrit. \xc2\xa0Tikrit, an iconic city in the heart of Salah ad-Din province, it\xe2\x80\x99s where ISIL moved into in the summer of 2014 and totally depopulated the city -- killed thousands of people in massacres they put on YouTube. \xc2\xa0It was retaken last year. \xc2\xa0And then we focused very hard, after the military operations, on what we call stabilization. \xc2\xa0And that means returning internally displaced people, getting them back to their homes, getting the lights back on. \xc2\xa0Extremely, extremely difficult to do, especially when we don\xe2\x80\x99t have large numbers of forces on the ground to do this. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re working through the U.N. and through our local partners. \xc2\xa0But Tikrit has been a real success. \xc2\xa0About 90 to 99 percent of the people are now back in their homes. \xc2\xa0And one reason of that is very good cooperation from the Iraqi government and Prime Minister Abadi, and he\xe2\x80\x99s delegating a lot of authority to the locals in these areas, so the governor of Salah ad-Din province and to local Sunni leaders in these areas that kind of take charge. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then through the Global Coalition, we have a stabilization fund -- about $80 million now -- to fund these very quick-hit rapid projects. \xc2\xa0So Tikrit was a proof of concept. \xc2\xa0It actually worked pretty well. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd now we\xe2\x80\x99re looking to do the same thing in Ramadi, which is number eight on the map. \xc2\xa0Security operations in Ramadi finished about a few weeks ago. \xc2\xa0There are still some things ongoing. \xc2\xa0But now we\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on the stabilization piece, trying to get people back into their homes, and most importantly, trying to get de-mining, and IEDs out of the streets and out of the homes. \xc2\xa0The governor of Anbar province -- I was in Baghdad about 10 weeks ago -- I talked to the governor who was just in Ramadi; every second or third home is wired with IEDs and land mines. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo to get people back, we have to get the de-mining teams in. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s Iraqi de-mining teams but also international de-mining teams. \xc2\xa0The foreign minister of Norway will be here later this week. \xc2\xa0Norway has taken a global leadership role in this type of issue. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking to them about that. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s setting up the conditions for Ramadi to get the stabilization moving. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s, again, already started. \xc2\xa0We have -- about 36 electricity generators have come in; about 115 more will be coming in in phase two. \xc2\xa0Very, very hard. \xc2\xa0Very painstaking. \xc2\xa0Very tedious. \xc2\xa0It requires the government of Baghdad to delegate authority to local leaders in Anbar province. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99re working with them on every single day. \xc2\xa0So the Ramadi stabilization piece about what comes after ISIL is a real focus of ours. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNumber nine, in Haditha -- I point out Haditha because there\xe2\x80\x99s Al Asad Air Base there. \xc2\xa0And early on in this campaign, President Obama made the decision to put our forces and our Special Forces out at Al Asad Air Base. \xc2\xa0We were joined by some of our coalition partners. \xc2\xa0And it was really -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out there a few times -- it is Wild West territory. \xc2\xa0It was very difficult. \xc2\xa0Had we not gotten out there when we did, this entire area would have been controlled by ISIL. \xc2\xa0But we started working with about two or three tribes, reconnecting with relationships we had previously. \xc2\xa0Those tribes are now fully mobilized. \xc2\xa0We have about 10,000 tribal fighters now in Anbar Province. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re not only defending against ISIL, they\xe2\x80\x99re now moving and operating on offensive operations, and doing a great job. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s because of our great operators who are out there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNumber ten is Rutbah. \xc2\xa0Rutbah is the highway from Amman to Baghdad. \xc2\xa0We had a team last week in Amman. \xc2\xa0King Abdullah is, of course, here this week. \xc2\xa0We saw the King last week in Amman with his entire interagency team -- his chief of defense, his intelligence chief, his foreign minister -- to talk about western Anbar province and Jordan, and the role that Jordan can play, and the importance of opening up this economic lifeline. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re also going to be looking to do. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s just not defeating ISIL, it\xe2\x80\x99s about what comes after, and opening up the economic interconnections between these places that ISIL has severed. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll just focus last on eleven -- that\xe2\x80\x99s Palmyra. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s important because it\xe2\x80\x99s the dark red. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult for ISIL now to take territory. \xc2\xa0The last major offensive operation it really had was in May of last year, when it retook Ramadi. \xc2\xa0Little things here and there. \xc2\xa0But Palmyra is -- as we push ISIL from the north, they try to fill space to the south and southwest, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also something we\xe2\x80\x99re focused very much with our Jordanian partners on. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s one reason King Abdullah will be here this week, and we look forward to seeing him. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99ll, of course, see the President. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo all of this, it\xe2\x80\x99s military, it\xe2\x80\x99s economic, it\xe2\x80\x99s diplomatic, it\xe2\x80\x99s political. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinarily complex. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve made a great deal of progress, particularly over the last six months after we put a lot of the pieces together. \xc2\xa0And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see over the coming weeks and months more of that kind of coming into shape. \xc2\xa0Shaddadi is something that\xe2\x80\x99s happening this week, but there will be more things like it over the coming week, which I won\xe2\x80\x99t really preview. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, of course, to pull this all together, we\xe2\x80\x99re in constant communication with our national security team and the President. \xc2\xa0And the President will be coming to the State Department on Thursday -- as he\xe2\x80\x99s come to the Pentagon in the past; and we, of course, have meetings here in the Situation Room constantly -- but to talk about the political and diplomatic piece of this, which is critical to the long-term success. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that is the core -- shrinking the core in Iraq and Syria, which is fundamental to our overall strategy, and at the same time drawing up the global networks, and of course focusing on the affiliates. \xc2\xa0One thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say about the global networks -- my final point -- is finances, because I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve been briefed by my colleague, Adam, and others about the finances. \xc2\xa0It took a long time to figure out how is this organization financing itself, what are its weaknesses, and how can we go after it. \xc2\xa0That was a very intensive intelligence-driven exercise on our part and with the coalition. \xc2\xa0We learned an awful lot. \xc2\xa0And then we began to systematically, working with our DOD colleagues, rooting out their economic infrastructure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe know that ISIL is now cutting its salary to its fighters by about 50 percent, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see that continue to decrease. \xc2\xa0Their ability to fund themselves has taken a substantial hit, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure that it continues on that trajectory.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that, that\xe2\x80\x99s a very short overview of an extraordinarily complex situation. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Michelle, do you want to start?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0What can we say about the current numbers of foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria? \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing a lot about Saudi Arabia making these offers to possibly use ground troops or do something more. \xc2\xa0What can you say about that, as well?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0So, foreign fighters is a great question because the foreign fighter question kind of exemplifies why this is something -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen something like this before. \xc2\xa0So total foreign fighters we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- about 35,000 from 120 countries around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Traveling?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0No, total number that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over time. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten that down now to about -- I think the high-end estimate now is about 25,000. \xc2\xa0But if you put that in perspective -- and it depends on who you talk to, who were following this in the Afghanistan days in the \xe2\x80\x9880s -- there\xe2\x80\x99s about twice as many of jihadist foreign fighters that went into a theater, and that was only a handful of countries. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why this is such a global threat like something we\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo what are we trying to do? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not only working with our partners in Turkey to close the border and to do a good job in terms of who comes through Turkey, and the Turks have actually done a very good job at that recently. \xc2\xa0But also the source countries -- they\xe2\x80\x99re coming from 120 countries all around the world, and we need those countries to share information with Turkey, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve also improved that quite a bit. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s still an extraordinary challenge. \xc2\xa0We want to make sure that foreign fighters cannot get into Syria, and once they get into Syria, they\xe2\x80\x99ll never get out. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing some of them now try to go to Libya. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s much harder for them to come into Syria, and those that get into Syria are finding a pretty miserable go of it and we want to keep it that way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSaudi Arabia. \xc2\xa0Saudi Arabia is also a key partner in the coalition, a real leader in terms of the counter-messaging, particularly religiously based messaging that we obviously cannot take the lead on. \xc2\xa0And so we very much encourage that. \xc2\xa0And when they come to us with some ideas, we\xe2\x80\x99re very much open to those ideas because we want them to be a part of this campaign within the umbrella of our broader coalition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Ron.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You mentioned shrinking the core. \xc2\xa0In terms of the capability that ISIS had to plot or orchestrate the attack in Paris, what evidence is there that you have degraded that capability? \xc2\xa0Is there any? \xc2\xa0And do you think you have, or do you not know whether they have the same capability that they had a few months ago when they orchestrated that attack?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a great question. \xc2\xa0They have a sophisticated external plotting network. \xc2\xa0We know more about it now than we did before, and we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to learn more about it. \xc2\xa0And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve shown, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve done with similar networks, we will learn about it and then we will completely uproot it and eradicate it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat makes ISIL a little bit different is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a state-like entity. \xc2\xa0It tries to pretend that it\xe2\x80\x99s a state, it controls territory, it controls territory with millions of people. \xc2\xa0It plans operations in Raqqa, it then sends its operatives, we believe, from Raqqa up through that Manbij pocket, and they\xe2\x80\x99re able to sneak out. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s harder for them to get out now. \xc2\xa0So we really want to do two things: \xc2\xa0We want to make sure that border is sealed, and we want to take the territory away so they can\xe2\x80\x99t move.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs the map shows, as I mentioned, the Tishreen Dam, from Raqqa to Manbij is kind of how they used to go and then get out. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why we had to take away that Tishreen Dam. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s basically a bridge that crosses the Euphrates. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s much harder for them to move now, so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue doing that. \xc2\xa0And as we know who is part of that network, we\xe2\x80\x99ll of course target them, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something our DOD colleagues are focused on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But is that capability dependent on them physically moving out of Raqqa? \xc2\xa0Are there communications abilities that they have that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been able trace? \xc2\xa0You mentioned money, cutting salaries or pay of some fighters. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for to see what evidence there is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0So they try to do two things. \xc2\xa0They try to inspire lone-wolf attacks, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen. \xc2\xa0And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked very closely with the private sector, with Twitter, with Facebook, everything to eliminate their ability to do that, and we\xe2\x80\x99re doing some other things to eliminate their ability to do that. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of lone-wolf one-off attacks they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to inspire. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut they also are planning -- trying to plan bigger things. \xc2\xa0So Paris, for example, was we believe planned in Raqqa, planned by some of their foreign fighter external operatives. \xc2\xa0But, again, we find these people, and we do, and we\xe2\x80\x99re able to kill them. \xc2\xa0So, Jihadi John. \xc2\xa0Jihadi John was one of the main guys on the Internet trying to inspire lone-wolf attacks. \xc2\xa0That was his main reason for being a part of the organization of ISIL. \xc2\xa0Not only did we shut down his network, we were able to find him and kill him. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Andrew.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I was just wondering what you -- in your diplomatic engagement, what you say to Syrian rebels who think that perhaps the United States hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a reliable ally to them. \xc2\xa0In recent months, people have been pummeled in Aleppo, and the U.S. hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to step in and save them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re doing an awful lot. \xc2\xa0But one thing we\xe2\x80\x99re doing right now is working very hard at the cessation of hostilities. \xc2\xa0And nobody is under any illusions for how difficult this will be. \xc2\xa0And my colleague, Michael Ratney, is talking to all the groups now. \xc2\xa0And we are working particularly in this area north of Aleppo. \xc2\xa0Because the area north of Aleppo is not Nusra, it\xe2\x80\x99s not ISIL, it\xe2\x80\x99s moderate opposition groups. \xc2\xa0So if the cessation of hostilities is to take root and hold, we should see a serious de-escalation of violence there. \xc2\xa0And so the conflict in Syria between the regime and the opposition -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of discussions with our partners on this and with, of course, with the Russians and everyone else through this Vienna format. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd it\'s the type of conflict that can go on and on forever. \xc2\xa0And if you look at the numbers, just open-source numbers from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and other sources, about 100,000 combatants, give or take, have been killed. \xc2\xa0More fighters on the regime side have been killed than the opposition side.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is something that can just go on and on forever. \xc2\xa0And if the Russians don\'t make some changes in their behavior, and the regime doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make some changes in their behavior, and we can\'t have a serious political process for a transition -- which is now locked into U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 -- this will go on forever.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo what we\'re trying to do is to deescalate the conflict and to lock into place a cessation of hostilities, which will begin to change the dynamic -- to get humanitarian supplies into these besieged areas. \xc2\xa0We\'ve seen some progress in that. \xc2\xa0But that\'s one reason we\'re working so hard at that right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'ll know more next week about how this is going. \xc2\xa0We have a lot of people working very hard at it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If this ceasefire or cessation of hostilities doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold, is the U.S. credibility among those rebel groups further damaged?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0I think Secretary Kerry spoke to that before the Congress today. \xc2\xa0We\'re, of course, preparing for all contingencies. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You saw some car bombs in Damascus this week. \xc2\xa0Is it the U.S. assessment that ISIS has been able to infiltrate what has been an Assad stronghold? \xc2\xa0And if you could also talk -- what you\'re seeing in Libya. \xc2\xa0How is the growth of foreign fighters there and the kind of structure they\xe2\x80\x99re building different than what is happening in Syria?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0So ISIL took credit for those car bombings. \xc2\xa0It\'s signature ISIL-type attacks, and we have no reason to doubt it was ISIL. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve done a number of attacks in Damascus before. \xc2\xa0ISIL is really a threat to everybody. \xc2\xa0And one thing all of our partners in the region -- we try to make this point all the time -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s different threat perceptions in every capital around the region, but ISIL is a threat to absolutely everybody. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99re a threat, frankly, to the people in Damascus. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why we want to unite ranks as much as possible against ISIL.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLibya is just a bit of a different situation. \xc2\xa0You don\'t have the sectarian dynamic; you don\'t have a lot of the dynamics we have in Iraq and Syria. \xc2\xa0But we do see ISIL using the same tactics that it used in Syria. \xc2\xa0So it establishes itself. \xc2\xa0It eliminates all competitors and it tries to attract, through the migrant flow in Africa, it tries to attract foreign fighters into Libya. \xc2\xa0Its own open-source propaganda in Dabiq Magazine is now telling people, hey, don\'t go into the caliphate in Syria, come to Libya. \xc2\xa0So it\'s trying to attract as many foreign fighters to Libya as possible. \xc2\xa0And where it has roots, such as Sirte, it eliminates all of its competitors. \xc2\xa0And it\'s trying to project attacks outwards, as we\'ve seen in Tunisia. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, look, it\'s a serious threat and it\'s something that, obviously, we\'re focusing on every day. \xc2\xa0But the sequence of events in Libya that we want to see is to have the Libyan political process completed, and we\'re hoping to have a vote in the Libyan parliament to approve the new Government of National Accord, from which we can, as a whole international community -- which is locked into a U.N. Security Council resolution -- support that government and help them get on its feet. \xc2\xa0But when we see a threat emerging in Libya, we won\'t hesitate to act in the meantime.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you just clarify, given the proximity of Libya to Europe, is there more of a focus not only on these affiliates but on having those affiliates act externally -- more external attacks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0Yes, a lot of focus is on Libya. \xc2\xa0So when we had -- the coalition got together in Rome a couple weeks ago with Secretary Kerry, and a main topic of conversation was Libya. \xc2\xa0We\'re now flying -- I think the Italians announced yesterday -- flying our ISR out of Italy. \xc2\xa0So Libya is a huge focus, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve already launched external attacks from Libya. \xc2\xa0But one reason we launched the attack the other day on a leading terrorist who was responsible for the attacks in Tunisia and on a ISIL training camp was because, when we see an ISIL training camp and we see them doing pushups and calisthenics there every day, they\xe2\x80\x99re not there to lose weight. \xc2\xa0I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re there to train for something, and we\'re not going to let them do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Nadia.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m actually surprised that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk in detail about the efforts to fight ISIS in Syria, considering that you talked about the coalition, the Russians claiming that they are fighting there, the Syrian regime, et cetera. \xc2\xa0So considering that ISIS is not part of this cessation of hostility agreement that was signed yesterday, can you just put this in a picture, where are we now in terms of ISIS and its gaining territories or not in Syria? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd also, one part in this communiqu\xc3\xa9 that I\'m sure you saw yesterday -- that is says that the commission will identify both the areas under ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra. \xc2\xa0And you know very well, probably more than most people, that Jabhat al-Nusra was under Jaysh al-Fatah. \xc2\xa0So how difficult is it for all parties, actually, including the Russians, to target this Syrian opposition, the moderate one, if there\xe2\x80\x99s -- Jaysh al-Fatah and they are very close to Jabhat al-Nusra?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0It\'s an excellent question. \xc2\xa0And ISIL -- we have not seen them launch major operations in Syria for some time. \xc2\xa0It\'s doing some things right now -- actually northeast of Aleppo, trying to take away some territory from the regime. \xc2\xa0That sort of stuff goes on day to day. \xc2\xa0But delineating where ISIL is, is fairly easy; delineating where Nusra is in some parts of the country is also fairly easy. \xc2\xa0But we also have these difficult parts of the country where things are marbled together. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo if you read the statement carefully, we\'ve agreed to try to delineate as best we can, but also the groups that sign up to the cessation of hostilities will not be attacked by the Russians and the regime. \xc2\xa0It\'s very clear. \xc2\xa0So if groups are signing up to the cessation of hostilities and those attacks continue, that will be a clear violation of the cessation of hostilities. \xc2\xa0So it\'s very clearly stated and signed on to by the Russians. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we have to see how it is implemented, but this will all be -- the proof of the pudding is in the eating in these things. So we\'ll know once we get into the implementation phase. \xc2\xa0And if the Russians and the regime are continuing to attack opposition groups that are part of the cessation of hostilities, they will be in total violation of the cessation of hostilities. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\'ll know more as we get into next week. \xc2\xa0But you hit the nail on the head of a very difficult question, which we need to delineate as best we can. \xc2\xa0But we have an agreement from the Russians and, again, we have to see. \xc2\xa0But opposition groups that agree to the cessation of hostilities will not be attacked. \xc2\xa0So that\'s the agreement. \xc2\xa0And nobody is under any illusions of how difficult this will be, nor are we under any illusions that we can take their word as it stands. \xc2\xa0We have to see. \xc2\xa0I mean, the test will be in the implementation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You touched on this a bit, but can you kind of talk specifically about what comes next in Libya? \xc2\xa0You mentioned the recent airstrikes. \xc2\xa0Is this going to be an incremental approach where you expect to carry out more airstrikes as the political process plays out? \xc2\xa0And you said that this is a big focus in Europe. \xc2\xa0Do you expect a lot of cooperation from the European partners on this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0I would expect an awful lot of cooperation --Italy, France, a lot of those countries, particularly in Rome, are talking about taking a leading role, but mainly a leading role in supporting a new Government of National Accord. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s been a great effort and emphasis in getting that government formation process finalized. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, at the same time, though, we\'re not just letting these threats fester, as you saw earlier this week. \xc2\xa0But we want to see that government formed just as soon as possible. \xc2\xa0It\'s very important. \xc2\xa0My colleague, Jonathan Winer, our Envoy in Libya, is working this day and night with Martin Kobler, the U.N. Special Envoy. \xc2\xa0So we want to see that government formed. \xc2\xa0And once that government is formed, I think the international community and our partners in Europe will swing behind it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMeanwhile, when we see threats emerging such as ISIL, and threats emerging that threaten us or our partners in a very direct way, we won\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to act.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Brett, would you agree that the current counter-ISIL strategy is effective? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0I think if you look back to where we were only 18 months ago -- and I was in Iraq when Mosul fell; I was in Baghdad when we were having very serious conversations about the total collapse of Baghdad, about the fall of the Baghdad airport, about the fact that you had this entire fraying of an entire society; seven Iraqi army divisions simply totally collapsed -- if you go from that point to where we are now, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just take it from Iraq. \xc2\xa0Working as a coalition to rebuild an Iraqi security force that had been totally demoralized and almost on its back to getting them back up, to getting them trained, to bringing them back into some coherence -- that baseball bat analogy I used before -- and then to retake a city like Ramadi, one of the most difficult terrains in an urban environment to fight in -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made quite a bit of progress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut my first point here was how difficult this was going to be. \xc2\xa0We always said it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a long time. \xc2\xa0But if you go from where we were in the summer of 2014, and recognizing how difficult this is, and you just look at the map of taking away 40 percent of their territory in Iraq -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to shrink -- we\xe2\x80\x99re having some good effect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking out about one to two of their main, key leaders every few days, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing some things that obviously I won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about from the podium, but some momentum is beginning to build. \xc2\xa0They would flow freely from Raqqa to Mosul. \xc2\xa0They had the highway. And now they can\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0That road is entirely cut off. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to squeeze them, restrict them in Mosul, continue to squeeze and constrict them in Raqqa, and also continue to galvanize the entire international community against this threat, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a global challenge. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s also something that we began beginning in the summer of 2014. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think it has been effective, but nobody working with us every day is under any illusions of how difficult this is, of how sophisticated this organization is. \xc2\xa0I mean, its external plotting network is not just a bunch of leaders who are plotting; it\xe2\x80\x99s organic. \xc2\xa0They try to do lone-wolf attacks -- inspire lone-wolf attacks while they plan and try to do more sophisticated things. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we try to stay ahead of every day. \xc2\xa0We, within our government, led by the President and the national security team, we try to have a pretty flat organization, working with fusing information from the Treasury Department, Defense Department, State Department, to stay ahead of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s actually -- we\xe2\x80\x99re doing a better job at that now than we were about a year ago. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep at it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I think the momentum has turned. \xc2\xa0The foreign fighter numbers have begun to go down. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to keep at it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask you about Turkey. \xc2\xa0Can you sort of talk a little bit about their role in all of this? \xc2\xa0They didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be too happy when you met with YPG in Kobani, and they have basically said the U.S. should either for us or against us. \xc2\xa0Can you respond to that and sort of talk about how Turkey will play a role in the cessation of hostilities, but also making sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re not taking out the Kurdish fighters that we\xe2\x80\x99re partnered with?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve probably been to Turkey more than any country in the last 18 months. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re a critical partner of ours. \xc2\xa0I was last there with Vice President Biden. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re working with them extraordinarily closely. \xc2\xa0And, as I said when President Obama saw President Erdogan in Antalya for the G20, one of the main focuses of conversation was this 98-kilometer strip of border. \xc2\xa0We had some recommendations for the Turks; they had some recommendations for us. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve worked very closely together, and have made a real difference on that border. \xc2\xa0And so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue that very close partnership. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMy trip to Kobani was primarily focused on, as I mentioned, getting the political cohesiveness -- not just Kurds but Arabs, Christians, other units -- getting them together, a political cohesiveness, to begin to move on Shaddadi. \xc2\xa0And that was the main purpose of the trip. \xc2\xa0And now, I think, the fact that the Shaddadi operation is underway, I think we feel pretty good about it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work closely with Turkey day to day. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re one of the primary partners for us in this campaign. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s why the President spoke with President Erdogan for almost an hour and a half the other day. \xc2\xa0And we have to work on this closely together. \xc2\xa0So we can\xe2\x80\x99t succeed in this without Turkey. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll do Jon and then Tara.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, just a quick follow-up on the overall strategy and how effective. \xc2\xa0In your answer on the last 18 months, you talk about the territory that\xe2\x80\x99s been taken back in Syria and in Iraq. \xc2\xa0If you look at ISIL as an overall organization, and you factor in what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to gain in Libya and the foreign fighters that have now started to go to Libya, and you see what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done in terms of recruitment and inspiring followers globally, would you say that this organization is stronger or weaker now than it was 18 months ago? \xc2\xa0Not just the core here, but the overall.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0I think overall it\xe2\x80\x99s weaker. \xc2\xa0Look, a couple things. \xc2\xa0Some of the affiliates, such as Libya, it\xe2\x80\x99s ISIL taking advantage of an anarchic situation. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re not sending paratroopers into certain areas to start a franchise. \xc2\xa0Boko Haram is a preexisting problem, preexisting terrorist organization that now flies the flag of ISIL. \xc2\xa0So just because you have an ISIL affiliate pop up, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean suddenly it\xe2\x80\x99s a fundamentally different situation. \xc2\xa0These are mostly locally driven events.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLibya is a little different; that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about it. \xc2\xa0But we look at how they recruit, and they recruit on three levels. \xc2\xa0One is these kind of sun-drenched scenes of the caliphate, and come live in this historic movement. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s actually a vast majority of their propaganda -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s a historic movement, it\xe2\x80\x99s expanding, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go all the way to Rome, and come be a part of it. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s like 60 percent of the propaganda is that. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much attention because the second part is the gore and violence and the mayhem. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty small category of their propaganda. \xc2\xa0And then they have a religiously based message, which they also put out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut that first primary propaganda effort on their part is no longer credible. \xc2\xa0So their chief spokesman, Adnani, when he speaks now, he is very much on the defensive, trying to explain, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, here\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve lost all this territory, but we\xe2\x80\x99re coming back.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a totally different message. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s not inspiring people, I think, like it was 18 months ago. \xc2\xa0I mean, 18 months ago, when I\xe2\x80\x99d be in Malaysia or Australia, there was a sense that ISIL was just totally on the march, and that was having an effect, a radicalizing effect. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not the case anymore. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s shrinking. \xc2\xa0Their leaders are dying. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to be the case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHowever, Jonathan, I\xe2\x80\x99d just make the point, which I made in the beginning. \xc2\xa0Nobody here, working on this every day, is under any illusions for how difficult this is going to be, for how lethal this organization remains; for how hard it is to build not only a global coalition with all these different countries, but also a coalition of different actors on the ground; to be cohesive -- like I said, all these different shards of wood, to turn them into a bat to really fight. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s really hard. \xc2\xa0And given that, I think if you look at where we were 18 months ago until now, I think you can now see the progress and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see more I think over the coming months. \xc2\xa0But nobody is under any illusions for how hard this is going to be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Tara, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll let Brett go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks for your presentation. \xc2\xa0I liked the maps. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re very helpful. \xc2\xa0And obviously you thought about this so carefully, it\xe2\x80\x99s really interesting to hear your perspective on it. \xc2\xa0And I liked the way you described how the global perspective of the 125 countries. \xc2\xa0You talked about the moral imperative, so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering you can tell me more about where that comes from. \xc2\xa0I mean, you talked about how they put the women into slavery, but then also, where does that lead the U.S.?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0Well, look, this is an organization that enslaves women, it destroys our common heritage, it murders anybody that disagrees with them. \xc2\xa0So it speaks for itself. \xc2\xa0But I was in northern Iraq with the Peshmerga before they did the Sinjar operation, and you could get a sense from the fighters and from President Barzani and the commanders that this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t simply a mission against a brutal enemy; it\xe2\x80\x99s against an enemy that is just different for what it\xe2\x80\x99s done to people. \xc2\xa0It also, though, exemplifies why the post-ISIL is so hard. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you a story from that meeting, before that operation began.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tA very senior Peshmerga commander told me he was dealing with all the local leaders, particularly the Yazidis, who are from this area, about, after the operation, who\xe2\x80\x99s going to govern and who\xe2\x80\x99s going to take charge. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on, once areas are cleared, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have revenge attacks and tit for tat, because that can begin to unravel things very fast. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that in the past. \xc2\xa0And this Peshmerga commander told me he was discussing this with an elderly Yazidi civilian from this area, talking about this fact -- what comes after -- and he said the Yazidi elderly man said, you know, these people, Daesh, they took my wife, they took my three daughters, they took my sister, and all I have left in this life is my revenge against these people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that is what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done to the psychology in some of these places. \xc2\xa0And so what we\xe2\x80\x99re working to do, as we clear out ISIL, is try to make sure there\xe2\x80\x99s a way -- working with the U.N. and the coalition -- to restore life to these areas so you don\xe2\x80\x99t get into these cycles of revenge. \xc2\xa0But, I mean, your question hit on something for why not only is it imperative upon all of us to defeat this enemy, but also imperative upon all of us to focus on what comes after. \xc2\xa0And so that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the campaign.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Thank you, Brett.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MCGURK: \xc2\xa0Thank you very much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So I know the map up here was a little hard to read from there. \xc2\xa0We have copies of the map that we can distribute on paper, so just contact our office and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that we can get you a copy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut obviously Brett\xe2\x80\x99s experience in the region and the amount of work that he has put into this makes him I think a pretty useful messenger in helping all of you and your readers and viewers and listeners understand exactly what our strategy is and what we are focused on to advance the interests of the United States but also to keep the American people safe. \xc2\xa0And that work is ongoing at a rather rapid pace, even on those days when it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the headlines. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s actually rare for Brett to spend a day in Washington, D.C. and so I thought it was important to make sure that we try to make sure that all of you were on his schedule.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Where is he usually based?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, he is based here, but he spends so much time traveling in the region that it\xe2\x80\x99s unusual for him to spend an entire workday here in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0So we were pleased to have a little bit of his attention today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He was good.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0So with all that, Kevin, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions on other topics.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to turn to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0So should Senate Republicans take the advice of Joe Biden from 1992 when he said action on Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over, or Joe Biden of 2016 who insists the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee should get full consideration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin, I\xe2\x80\x99d go with both. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Because Vice President Biden in 1992, in the same speech that you noted, said if the President consults and cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selections absent consultation, then his nominees may enjoy my support, as did Justices Kennedy and Souter. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ve observed in the past that we can spend a lot of time sort of throwing quotes back and forth, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of indicative of some comments that the President made last week about how this process has become politicized. \xc2\xa0But when you consider the record of Senator Biden and his service on the Judiciary Committee, it\xe2\x80\x99s a record that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to beat. \xc2\xa0When you consider that he presided over the last time that the Senate voted to confirm a Supreme Court nominee in an election year, that was a nominee that was put forward by a Republican President, and Joe Biden was Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and ensured that Justice Kennedy got both a fair hearing and a timely yes-or-no vote. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re asking the Senate to do.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are a variety of examples of this. \xc2\xa0Senator Biden, more than anyone else, has ensured the fair confirmation of nine Supreme Court Justices. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any other senator that can stake a claim to that kind of record. \xc2\xa0He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just in the United States Senate so that he could confirm Supreme Court justices appointed by Democrats -- he often presided even in difficult situations, like an election year, of ensuring that even appointees of a Republican President were confirmed to the Supreme Court.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I know there\xe2\x80\x99s often this old adage that sometimes politicians are reduced to the expression that people should do as I say, not as I did. \xc2\xa0In this instance, we actually want the Republicans in the Senate to do precisely as Vice President Biden did when he served in the Senate. \xc2\xa0And if so, it will allow the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee when he puts that individual forward to get a fair hearing, to get a timely yes-or-no vote, and for the Supreme Court of the United States to function precisely as the Founders intended.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Obviously, senators are going to pick and choose quotes. \xc2\xa0Would you acknowledge that the comments -- Senator McConnell was speaking on the Senate floor quoting the Vice President. \xc2\xa0Would you acknowledge that this has made more difficult, more unlikely that the nominee will get a hearing and a vote this year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I would not, precisely because of Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s record when he served on the Judiciary Committee. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet me give you -- I mean, I said the examples of Justice Kennedy and his overall record of confirming Supreme Court justices. \xc2\xa0There are other elements of his record that are just as enlightening. \xc2\xa0Vice President Biden, when he presided over the confirmation hearing of Justice Thomas, he did not support Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s nomination to the Supreme Court, but yet he allowed Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s nomination to move through the Judiciary Committee and move onto the floor of the United States Senate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat is exactly the kind of commitment to the functioning of the institution of the United States Senate that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Republicans demonstrate. \xc2\xa0And again, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a matter of doing as Senator Biden recommends -- as then-Senator Biden recommended. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s going as then-Senator Biden actually did. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re counting on Republicans in the United States Senate to do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it because they are forced into some position based on awkward quotes that they themselves have given -- and goodness knows there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of them. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see how long this goes; maybe we can discuss some of those as well. \xc2\xa0But in some ways, the most important element of this is they have a constitutional duty. \xc2\xa0They swore to uphold an oath and to fulfill the responsibility that the institution of the United States Senate has to consider the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee, to give that individual a fair hearing, and to give that person a yes-or-no vote.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I know there are at least two Senate Republicans yesterday who acknowledged that oath and acknowledged that if the President -- when the President nominates someone, that hearings should go forward. \xc2\xa0Senator Kirk himself specifically referenced the oath that he took not just as a member of the United States Senate, but also as a member of our armed forces. \xc2\xa0He certainly takes that oath seriously, and he recognizes that giving the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee a fair hearing is what that oath requires. \xc2\xa0And hopefully he will be able to persuade other members in his conference of the importance of that oath.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAyesha.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Turning to the report on Guantanamo Bay, why not name the 13 facilities considered, or at least make -- and also to make a recommendation for a facility to move the transferees that would be left over? \xc2\xa0Part of what the administration is saying is they kind of want to -- you want to rise above politics with this issue and to have Congress move forward. \xc2\xa0But are political concerns keeping you from naming these facilities? \xc2\xa0And is it a concern about not wanting to put certain lawmakers on the spot if you name certain facilities or put them on the table?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Ayesha, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to hear that the reason that the administration can\xe2\x80\x99t undertake a more thorough and detailed evaluation of a specific site is because it\xe2\x80\x99s specifically prevented by Congress. \xc2\xa0Congress passed a statute that instructed and has prevented the administration from undertaking serious planning that would be required to do the prudent thing, which is close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and to take those individuals who cannot be safely transferred to other countries and incarcerate them here in the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat is a common-sense proposal, as the plan that we rolled out today makes clear. \xc2\xa0It would save taxpayers billions of dollars over a couple of decades, or at least $1.7 billion over a couple of decades. \xc2\xa0And we would be eager -- in fact, we are asking Congress to work with us to allow us to do the kind of planning that needs to be done to do this safely and in a cost-effective fashion. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need congressional cooperation in order to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCongressional cooperation in this instance is a reference to Congress actually removing a barrier that prevents that from happening. \xc2\xa0And if Congress is willing to act on that, then we\'ll be able to move in a direction of actually having serious discussions about specific plans. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the Department of Defense, I know, has indicated that these kinds of plans could be initiated in relatively short order. \xc2\xa0So this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily need to be a longer-term goal, but what we need to see in the short term is a willingness on the part of the United States Congress to put the interest of our national security ahead of the interest of their politics.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So are you saying that this law is the law that\'s preventing -- or that prevented the administration from putting forward a more detailed plan? \xc2\xa0I mean, this was a nine-page plan not including the appendix. \xc2\xa0So it seemed kind of sparse. \xc2\xa0Are you saying that it was legislation, laws that have been passed that prevented you from going into more detail? \xc2\xa0And also, if it\'s the case, if it\'s you need Congress to act to pass laws to remove these restrictions, if they don\'t move, what is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s plan going forward?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me be clear about this. \xc2\xa0The administration is constrained by law from undertaking designed or detailed planning for a U.S.-based facility. \xc2\xa0And that hinders our ability to put forward the kind of details that you\'re suggesting. \xc2\xa0However, what we were able to do within the confines of the law is to develop a plan based on a prototype detention facility, essentially a model that could give us an estimate about what that looks like.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat that looks like is a savings to the taxpayers of up to $85 million a year. \xc2\xa0Over about 10 years, that\'s a net savings, once you\xe2\x80\x99ve factored in the transition costs, of more than $300 million over 10 years. \xc2\xa0And those costs explode over the longer term -- we\'re talking a savings of about $1.7 billion in net savings over 20 years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there is a clear argument. \xc2\xa0The facts bear this out -- \xc2\xa0even in our nine-page report -- you can take a look at the numbers and see that there is a significant benefit for taxpayers of doing something that is clearly within our national security interests. \xc2\xa0It is not just President Obama who thinks that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay would advance our national security; President Bush held the same view. \xc2\xa0Senator McCain, at one point, even held the same view. \xc2\xa0This is obviously the view of our Department of Defense that issued this report. \xc2\xa0This is the view of \xc2\xa060 retired generals and other senior military officers who wrote a letter to the *President Congress today, announcing their support for this plan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe hear a lot of rhetoric on the campaign trail that the President needs to do a better job of listening to his military commanders and military leaders. \xc2\xa0This is what our military leaders suggest is necessary to enhance our national security. \xc2\xa0And right now, it is Congress who isn\'t just listening to them -- failing to listen to them, it\'s Congress who is actively blocking these steps to save taxpayers money and to make our country safer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, Josh, given what you just said, and given what Loretta Lynch said back in November when she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWith respect to individuals being transferred to the United States, the law currently does not allow that. \xc2\xa0Certainly it is the position of the Department of Justice that we would follow the law of the land in regard to that issue.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0So given that it would be against the law to bring detainees at Guantanamo Bay to the United States, is it safe to say that if Congress does not act to change the law, then the prison at Guantanamo Bay will not be closed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jon, I\'m not ready to arrive at that conclusion. \xc2\xa0What we\'re focused on right now is congressional consideration of a plan that they specifically asked for so that we can have a discussion about the best path forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think it\'s clear, based on the fact that we\'ve submitted this plan to Congress right on the deadline and the time frame that they asked for, that we\'re interested in a robust consultation about this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, but wait a minute. \xc2\xa0I don\'t understand how you can say that you\'re not willing to rule that out. \xc2\xa0It\'s against the law. \xc2\xa0The law says, as I think you just said from the podium, and certainly the Attorney General of the United States said in congressional testimony, and in fact, the Defense Secretary said just last month in congressional testimony, it is against the law to move those detainees to the United States. \xc2\xa0So unless you\'re just going to let them all go, how could you close down that prison?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, nobody is talking about letting them all go. \xc2\xa0So we put forward this very specific plan for how these individuals can either be safely transferred to other countries, how they can go through a criminal justice process, or how they can be safely incarcerated here in the United States. \xc2\xa0That is a cost-effective plan that is consistent with our national security interest.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the congressional reaction to that plan, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, what I have seen is the plan that we have put forward actually lay out exactly why what our argument is reflects the facts. It reflects the facts that we can save money by doing it in the way that we\'ve outlined, and it reflects the need to protect our national security. \xc2\xa0And we\'re interested in a serious conversation with Congress about this. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLook, there is this emerging trend in Congress that has worsened in just the last few weeks where Congress isn\'t simply in a position of just saying no; Congress is actually refusing to engage. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re not just actively saying no, they\xe2\x80\x99re refusing to do the basic function of their job. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re refusing to consider this specific Gitmo plan. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re refusing to even consider the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re refusing to even take any sort of action on an AUMF. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99ve refused to even convene a hearing to discuss the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget with the President\xe2\x80\x99s Budget Director -- something that has happened every year for the last 40 years. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I\'m not really sure exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing in Congress. \xc2\xa0But they\xe2\x80\x99re doing just about everything except for fulfilling their basic constitutional responsibility.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On this case, Congress actually has acted, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve acted repeatedly, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve acted to vote in a bipartisan fashion to say no, they don\'t want detainees from Guantanamo Bay brought to the United States. \xc2\xa0So I\'m asking you, if they don\'t act on this, if they don\'t approve this plan that you\xe2\x80\x99ve just outlined, can the President still close that detention facility before he leaves office?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jon, Congress specifically --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes or no, can he still do it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Congress specifically requested this plan on this time frame, and we have provided it to them. \xc2\xa0So, again, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to decide whether or not they actually want to take a look at this. \xc2\xa0What they have done thus far, as you point out, is put in place barriers that have prevented the administration from moving forward in this way. \xc2\xa0But by putting those barriers in place, they have led us down the path of a policy that wastes taxpayer dollars and makes the United States of America more vulnerable to terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\'re not answering my -- it\'s a really simple question. \xc2\xa0If those barriers remain in place, can you still close that facility, yes or no?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President himself has considered this question, and what he has said publicly is that our focus is going to be on working with Congress. \xc2\xa0And working with Congress requires presenting them a specific plan on the time frame that they asked for. \xc2\xa0That\'s exactly what we\'ve done. \xc2\xa0And we\'re now asking for Congress to give it fair consideration. \xc2\xa0And I\'m not going to speculate at this point if Congress refuses to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one last thing. \xc2\xa0Marco Rubio today suggested that the President is also considering turning over the entire naval base to Cuba. \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that in the white paper. \xc2\xa0Is that something that is under consideration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\'s not under consideration, and we\'ve said that many times.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tScott.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In deciding the cost savings over a 20-year period -- does that mean the American people should expect that some of these inmates will be held for 20 more years, in some cases without charge?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Scott, in some cases, we\'re talking about individuals who were initially apprehended and transferred to the prison at Guantanamo Bay at pretty young ages, as teenagers. \xc2\xa0So it does mean that we need to start thinking long term about how this process is going to work.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, our preference is, where possible, to conduct the review and determine how these individuals can be transferred to other countries, with appropriate security restraints to make sure that we are mitigating any risk that they may pose to the United States. \xc2\xa0There is a long process for certifying that. \xc2\xa0It requires a specific approval of the Secretary of Defense before an individual can be transferred. \xc2\xa0But there are about 35 individuals who are currently detained at the prison at Guantanamo Bay who are eligible for that process. \xc2\xa0We just need to find a willing partner overseas who\xe2\x80\x99s willing to receive that individual and put in place the security restraints that we believe are necessary.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\'ve discussed at some length the options for bringing these individuals to justice, either through military commissions or through Article 3 courts. \xc2\xa0The President made an allusion to some reforms of that process that he believes would make military commissions, in particular, themselves more cost-effective and efficient. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLook, some of you also may have seen earlier today a tweet from the Chief of Staff who indicated that right now we have a situation at the prison at Guantanamo Bay that it\'s not possible for some individuals to actually just plead guilty. \xc2\xa0That\'s an indication that we need to fix a broken system. \xc2\xa0And right now, again, as Jon pointed out, all we\'ve seen are Congress throwing up obstacles. \xc2\xa0And what we would like to see is Congress engage with us on this plan so that we can act in the best interest of taxpayers, that we can act in the best interest of our national security, and that we don\'t end up in a situation where this unwieldy problem ends up on the plate of the next President, whoever that person may be. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMargaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, people on the Hill are calling this dead on arrival. \xc2\xa0Is there a plan B?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the plan was put forward just a couple of hours ago. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This plan that they\xe2\x80\x99re saying is dead on arrival.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, it sounds like it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty inconsistent. \xc2\xa0So I guess, look, I guess you have to ask Congress if they were pretty disingenuous in making the request that we actually send them a plan. \xc2\xa0It sounds like they didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually take it very seriously. \xc2\xa0And, again, I actually think that just reinforces a pretty significant problem that Congress has right now. \xc2\xa0I think by anybody who is paying attention, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to figure out exactly what Congress is doing. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re certainly not doing their job. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re not considering a plan to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve ruled out consideration of the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve refused to take any sort of tangible action on an authorization to use military force against ISIL. \xc2\xa0And they won\xe2\x80\x99t even engage in a hearing with the President\xe2\x80\x99 budget director on the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal in the same way that every Congress for the last 40 years has. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Congress right now. \xc2\xa0What we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now is doing the job of the American people -- making sure that we are being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and looking out for our national security. \xc2\xa0And so I think in each of those instances, what you have is you have the administration trying to move the country forward and trying to set politics aside and actually focus on the best interests of the country. \xc2\xa0On the part of Congress, you see nothing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But if the President and what you\xe2\x80\x99re describing is that the White House is really trying to work with Congress and, in many ways, dependent on Congress to get this prison closed, but in the face of that intractable opposition, is the President willing to leave office with Guantanamo Bay still open? \xc2\xa0Is he ready to admit defeat?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That surely is not his preference. \xc2\xa0As the President noted today --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it a possibility?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0-- I remember standing -- sitting in that chair, right over there, and I believe it was January 22nd, 2009, where the President put forward his specific plan for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about this in detailed fashion for more than seven years. \xc2\xa0This has been a top priority. \xc2\xa0And at each turn, we have been stymied by Congress, and that\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating. \xc2\xa0But that frustration pales in comparison to how irresponsible it is to treat taxpayer dollars and our national security in that way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But are you just going to let the clock keep ticking? \xc2\xa0I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a year left here, and time is of the essence, as the White House keeps saying.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Right now, it appears that Congress is going to let the clock tick without doing anything. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve put together --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So Gitmo will stay open after President Obama leaves office?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward a very specific plan for ensuring that that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that somebody in Congress somewhere will actually take a serious look at this, be willing to put the national security of the United States and the importance of efficient use of taxpayer dollars ahead of their own personal political considerations. \xc2\xa0I recognize that that may be a bold consideration to make in Washington, D.C. these days, particularly in an election year, but it\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people expect and it\xe2\x80\x99s what the Constitution requires.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But can you address -- the President talked about what he saw as this sort of scary idea for people -- moving terrorists closer to the U.S. mainland and, in some ways, to their own backyard. \xc2\xa0Given that there are, among these 91 people here, still about 46 who can\xe2\x80\x99t be cleared out, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough evidence against them, but there\xe2\x80\x99s too much worry to release them. \xc2\xa0Moving those people to the U.S. mainland, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that just shifting the same problem to another zip code so that the next President faces the exact same problem of indefinite detention of detainees with no clear sign of avoiding what has become what the White House says is a rallying point for terrorists?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot there, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve raised what I think is an important question -- several important questions. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe first thing, as the President referenced in his statement in the Roosevelt Room earlier today, is that there are hardened, dangerous terrorists who, right now, even as we speak -- dozens of them -- who are serving time in American prisons on American soil, right now. \xc2\xa0That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make the United States more vulnerable, it makes us safer. \xc2\xa0They have gone through a criminal justice process where they have been convicted and they are serving time, and they are being held where they cannot pose a threat to the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But in this case, many of these detainees, it is not nearly as clear cut in terms of the evidence and in terms of the trial. \xc2\xa0And that is one of the problems along these many years with closing the facility, is how do you get around all that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0So there are a group of people where that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply; where we should be able to find a justice process of one form or another that will allow the justice to be served. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s also true is there is a process that was put in place on January 22nd of 2009 that initiated a formal review of the files of these individuals who were detained to determine how and where they could be safely transferred. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to implement that process to determine if there are more individuals who, based on an updated intelligence assessment and based on updated diplomatic conversations with our partners, could be safely transferred somewhere else in a way that is consistent with our national security interests.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that more people from the group of 46 or 56 that we have here, that they could be moved into the category of eligible-for-transfer. \xc2\xa0And that is a testament to the success of the process that the administration put in place on the President\xe2\x80\x99s second full day in office. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut look, the final thing is, the option is -- the other option that right now Congress is nudging us in the direction of is one that only serves to exacerbate our national security vulnerabilities. \xc2\xa0It only allows extremist organizations to continue to use the operation of the prison at Guantanamo Bay as a recruiting tool. \xc2\xa0We know that they do that. \xc2\xa0And why we give them that weapon to use against us is beyond me.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that the dollars and cents here just don\xe2\x80\x99t add up to a logical, Republican congressional strategy. \xc2\xa0Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s some Democrats who are complicit in this too. \xc2\xa0So this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- members of Congress suggesting that we continue to operate the prison at Guantanamo Bay even after we\xe2\x80\x99ve transferred all those individuals who are eligible for transfer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add up. \xc2\xa0The per-inmate cost of the prison at Guantanamo Bay is only going to continue to skyrocket. \xc2\xa0And when you look at the longer-term cost implications -- well, look, even in the short term it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn the short term, we could recoup the transfer costs in three to five years, but essentially be in a situation where we are saving taxpayers up to $85 million each year by moving these individuals to U.S. soil. \xc2\xa0Over the long term, the cost savings are even more significant.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo when you consider just the dollars and cents here, when you\xe2\x80\x99re a fiscal conservative and looking at making sure that government is smaller and that taxpayer dollars are effectively used and efficiently used, that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking to cut wasteful spending, $85 million a year -- that seems like a pretty sizable amount. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tToluse.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I just follow up on the numbers of this? \xc2\xa0It seems like this plan was delayed for many months, basically as you guys tried to get the cost squared away. \xc2\xa0And it does sound like you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have 30 to 60 individuals, and even though you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be saving $85 million, it\xe2\x80\x99s still hundreds of millions of dollars -- probably over $200 million -- for 30 to 60 individuals. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that cost is something that the President is comfortable with. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s still a per-prisoner cost of several million dollars. \xc2\xa0So is that something the President is comfortable with? \xc2\xa0Is that something you\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to get -- you\xe2\x80\x99re tried to get that number down more, and struggled with that? \xc2\xa0And is that the reason why the plan was delayed so long?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, Toluse, I think what is true is that once we have an opportunity to take a closer look more specifically at the way that a U.S. facility could be used, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that there might be some additional cost savings. \xc2\xa0But we can\xe2\x80\x99t do that important work until Congress agrees to start working with us to see if that\xe2\x80\x99s even possible. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI guess in the same way that it costs money to run prisons in the United States, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to cost money to detain these individuals, even if we bring them to the United States. \xc2\xa0Releasing them, at least in some cases, is not an option. \xc2\xa0So shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we just try to find the most cost-effective way to do it? \xc2\xa0And isn\xe2\x80\x99t it ridiculous and irresponsible to suggest that we should just wantonly spend an extra $85 million a year to keep these individuals at a prison at Guantanamo Bay that, oh, \xc2\xa0by the way, terrorists actually use as a recruiting tool? \xc2\xa0That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a not a good way to run the country. \xc2\xa0It certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t the best way to look out for our national security, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not a good way to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of our case here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd look, when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about people who are strong on national security, people who are serious fiscal conservatives, people who are willing to listen to the advice of our military commanders, you sound a little like a Republican trying to make a foreign policy decision -- at least how Republican candidates for President suggest they would make foreign policy decisions. \xc2\xa0So let\xe2\x80\x99s start living up to our rhetoric here and actually do the right thing for the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The NDAA kind of specifically called for the administration to put out a specific name of a facility or facilities. \xc2\xa0And I know you said that the law also kind of restricts you from doing the research that you need to do, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t restrict you from naming facilities that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at. \xc2\xa0DOD didn\xe2\x80\x99t look at facilities last year, so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t restrict you from sort of maybe narrowing the pocket down to just a few facilities that you\xe2\x80\x99re actually considering. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why the administration didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that, because that\xe2\x80\x99s a criticism that you\xe2\x80\x99re getting from the Hill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, the reason that these site visits were made was to inform our development of prototype facilities that would allow us to take a look at exactly how this would be done. \xc2\xa0But we are prohibited by law from developing the kind of specifics and details around a specific facility.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo look, this is exactly part of what congressional engagement should be. \xc2\xa0We should have a discussion about where this kind of facility would be located. \xc2\xa0So if there are Republicans that have strong ideas about what would be a good place, then they should bring forward those ideas. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re happy to have that discussion. \xc2\xa0We can take a close look at whether that would meet our requirements and whether that would actually bring about the kind of tax savings that we envision. \xc2\xa0We would welcome that kind of discussion on the part of Congress. \xc2\xa0But right now, Congress has passed a law that prevents that conversation from taking place. \xc2\xa0Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not consistent with anybody\xe2\x80\x99s idea about what it means to do your job.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more. \xc2\xa0There have been several district attorneys who have said that they\xe2\x80\x99re also looking to get a \xe2\x80\x9cbackdoor\xe2\x80\x9d into phones and that if this case does go forward and Apple does cooperate with the FBI, there\xe2\x80\x99s not just going to be this one phone -- they have several phones that they\xe2\x80\x99re waiting to use as well in this same way. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve made it sound like it\xe2\x80\x99s just going to be this one isolated case, but is there a threat that other district attorneys across the country will be able to use this case as a way to get into phones for other types of cases that aren\xe2\x80\x99t terrorism related?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say, Toluse, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the details of other cases that may be out there. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99ll let prosecutors, if they have cases that they think are comparable to this, to make their own case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked about is this very specific request that the Department of Justice and our independent investigators at the FBI have made to a judge. \xc2\xa0They haven\xe2\x80\x99t sought to do this on their own; they have gone through a judicial process, through a legal process, to obtain access to a phone that was used by a terrorist, that is no longer living, that was actually the property and was owned by the local government in California. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99ve limited my comments to this specific request. \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to other requests that may be out there. \xc2\xa0If there are additional requests that have to be made by local prosecutors, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go before a judge. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of exactly the case that we have been making, which is I have not stood up here and suggested that the FBI should be able to decide whether or not they get access to this phone. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve also stood up here and said that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be Apple who decides who gets access to this phone. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a court of law and there is a procedure in place to determine and to weigh the merits of the arguments that are made by both sides. \xc2\xa0And in this case, a judge has come down on the side of the independent investigators at the Department of Justice. \xc2\xa0And given the way the President has made this investigation a priority -- because information that is yielded in the investigation could be relevant to continuing to protect the American people -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that the FBI will continue to do its important work.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKevin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Is it your understanding that the NSA is still in the practice of collecting bulk metadata? \xc2\xa0And if so, if that\xe2\x80\x99s your understanding, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the FBI simply go to them to get the information that they claim they need from this particular device?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that last year Congress passed legislation to reform this program, to ensure that the intelligence community would no longer be in the business of collecting that bulk metadata that was included in Section 215 of the Patriot Act. \xc2\xa0So that is no longer taking place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So there is no collection, to your understanding, of bulk phone records at all? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I know, based on the law that was passed by Congress last year with bipartisan support, is it made critical reforms that actually put telephone companies in a position to collect that data and with a court order, the law enforcement officials could conduct the kind of searches that are critical to our national security. \xc2\xa0But it would not be a situation where the U.S. government was in a position of holding that data ourselves.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me follow up on something Margaret was asking you about, and this is sort of a broader question about detainees. \xc2\xa0Considering there is ongoing battle in theaters all over the globe involving terrorists, where are they being held, once they\xe2\x80\x99re captured?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, there is a process for this. \xc2\xa0And, again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to sort of envision in our mind how this might work. \xc2\xa0We have time and time again demonstrated that we can, when it comes to terrorists who are apprehended in the United States, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a process in place where we can make sure that they are subject to robust interrogation, that our intelligence officials can use that information to enhance our national security, that we can get the information we need out of them to make sure that we can keep the American people safe, and then we can turn them over to law enforcement interrogators who can put them through the Justice system. \xc2\xa0Those individuals have been convicted, and some of them, many of them are actually serving time right now on American soil, in American prison facilities, no longer posing a threat to our national security. \xc2\xa0We have a system in place that works, that keeps the American people safe and lives up to our values.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What about the ones captured on the battlefield? \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re in Syria -- so, for example, they\xe2\x80\x99re not being transported back here. \xc2\xa0Where are they held? \xc2\xa0Because the argument that some are making now is since we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in ongoing battle that involves terrorists that may be apprehended on the battlefield that don\xe2\x80\x99t represent a particular country, they have to be housed somewhere, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be detained. And the argument that some are making is that a facility like Guantanamo is still going to be important moving forward, even beyond the 91 current detainees.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, over the last seven years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve waged a very aggressive campaign -- a counterterrorism campaign all around the world. \xc2\xa0And that has been in Iraq, that\xe2\x80\x99s been in Syria, that\xe2\x80\x99s been in Afghanistan, and that\xe2\x80\x99s been in a variety of other countries around the world. \xc2\xa0Not one prisoner has been transferred or added to the population at the prison at Guantanamo Bay since President Obama took office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So they\xe2\x80\x99re being held abroad.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So in each case -- we are on a case-by-case basis, evaluating the best way to bring these individuals to justice or to at least make sure that they cannot pose a threat to U.S. national security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet me just give you one example. \xc2\xa0There is the woman who was the wife of the ISIL leader that was killed in a raid conducted by U.S. forces in Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Syria, yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This was last year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I remember.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And this woman was facing very serious charges related to ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s hostage-taking activities. \xc2\xa0That individual has faced a couple of things. \xc2\xa0Right now, that individual is in the custody of Kurdish officials and is going through the Kurdish criminal justice system. \xc2\xa0That individual has also been indicted by the Department of Justice for her complicity in hostage-taking activities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut given her terrorist background, she\xe2\x80\x99s in custody and she no longer is posing a threat to U.S. national security. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s just one textbook example of how, on a case-by-case basis, we can make sure we take actions that put the safety and security of the American people at the top of the list, but also make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re acting consistent with our values. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So essentially what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is because these facilities exist, would it not be then possible to take some of the detainees that are currently housed at Guantanamo and move them to some of these other facilities, ultimately emptying out the prison in Cuba?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, what we would have to do is we would have to evaluate the security measures in place at those other facilities, and we\xe2\x80\x99d also have to get the agreement --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They must be pretty strong if they\xe2\x80\x99re housing terrorists like the one you just mentioned.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0-- but we also have to -- well, first of all, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking, in some cases, about terrorists who may pose a significant threat. \xc2\xa0And so we need to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the security measures in place to keep them safe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut here\xe2\x80\x99s the other thing -- and I think this goes back to the core problem with the prison at Guantanamo Bay -- why would another country want to take them? \xc2\xa0Why would they want to take on that problem? \xc2\xa0Members of the United States Congress certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take on that problem, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a problem that was created by the United States government. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important for us to resolve this situation before the next President takes office, because it ends up being a sticking point in our relationships with friends and allies and partners with whom we have other important business to conduct. \xc2\xa0And this lingering issue is one that only serves to cloud the agenda that already has a lot of high-profile and high-priority national security items on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0On the high court -- is it your concern that if what\xe2\x80\x99s happening now, or what appears to be happening now, which is it\xe2\x80\x99s become political and it may not -- this particular nominee may not get an up-or-down vote, or even a hearing -- that when the tables have turned and eventually the Democrats are in control, that this will happen again, this will cloud the process in the future?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There is no denying that what Republicans are threatening to do in the context of this Supreme Court nominee is unprecedented. \xc2\xa0Since 1875, a President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee has never been denied a hearing unless that President later withdrew that nomination. \xc2\xa0And this would be an historic and unprecedented acceleration of politicizing a branch of government that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be insulated from politics. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd while there -- as the President has acknowledged, there are Democrats and Republicans who are responsible for contributing to that. \xc2\xa0There is no denying that what Leader McConnell and other Republicans are proposing to do right now would turbocharge that process and may, in some ways, subject the Supreme Court to the kind of politics that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been insulated from for more than two centuries. \xc2\xa0And that would be a shame. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd fortunately, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the only person that\xe2\x80\x99s making that argument. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen statements from people like Senator Kirk, Senator Collins. \xc2\xa0Even somebody like Senator Blunt, a Republican from my home state of Missouri, has indicated that he believes that this nominee should get a hearing. \xc2\xa0So, again, in some ways, if I were sitting in your chair, the observation that I would make is there\xe2\x80\x99s actually not bipartisan support for blocking the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee; in fact, there is actually bipartisan support for making sure this individual gets a hearing, a fair one, and gets a timely yes-or-no vote. \xc2\xa0Hopefully, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll get.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMichelle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, just today, in Spain, a former Gitmo detainee was arrested as a suspected terrorist recruiting for ISIS. \xc2\xa0Officials there said that he was a leader who was trained in weapons and explosives. \xc2\xa0Does that matter?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It does matter. \xc2\xa0Because of the changes that this administration put in place, again, back on January 22nd of 2009, the recidivism rate that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from individuals who have been transferred under the formula that was put in place by the Obama administration, that recidivism rate is in the single digits. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s quite small. \xc2\xa0And it underscores how important it is for us to have in place the appropriate security arrangements for when we transfer an individual to another country. \xc2\xa0We can do this safely. \xc2\xa0We know how to do this. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s both in our national security interest, but it also is much more cost-effective than what\xe2\x80\x99s happening right now. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So let\xe2\x80\x99s say just one or two of the thirty-five that are potentially going to be transferred went back to fight for ISIS -- and this example today, I mean, this is somebody who is in Europe while the United States is fighting ISIS. \xc2\xa0So of this new batch, let\xe2\x80\x99s say the recidivism rate is only in the single digits, at this period of time, when we\xe2\x80\x99re at war and ISIS is acting in other countries beside Iraq and Syria, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a significant threat?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a threat that we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of. \xc2\xa0But again, according to your own reporting, this individual has been apprehended by authorities. \xc2\xa0The other thing, Michelle, is that if we know we\xe2\x80\x99re at war with terrorist organizations that are seeking to radicalize populations around the globe, and we know that the prison at Guantanamo Bay is a prominent recruiting tool that they use, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we take that away from them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLook, even the gory videos that were released by ISIL a couple of summers ago evoked some of the themes and imagery from the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0We know that they are seeking to capitalize on that as a propaganda victory, and we should take that away from them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So taking those same guys and transferring them to prisons in the U.S., wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that then just become the recruiting tool? \xc2\xa0As the argument has been, if there were to be some violent protests surrounding that, then it would be on U.S. soil. \xc2\xa0So I guess at the crux of it --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate argument because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there are any huge protests that are taking place on Cuban soil right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Then just as a recruiting tool, your argument that Gitmo itself is the recruiting tool, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the recruiting tool then just be transferring to having these guys still held indefinitely in the U.S. be the same thing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, their argument would be a lot tougher because the detention that we would have in place would be cleanly in line with American values; that we would ensure that this is consistent with the way that American citizens are treated. \xc2\xa0That certainly is more consideration than these terrorists give to their adversaries, to say the least. \xc2\xa0But we would be on quite strong moral ground to say that these individuals are being treated humanely, that the conditions in which they are detained are safe and clean and reasonable. \xc2\xa0And we would be taking away an important propaganda tool that we know that extremist organizations, like ISIL, capitalize on. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBrett was just standing here at this podium talking about how we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of the threat that ISIL poses because of their ability to radicalize people around the globe. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s make that a little harder for them. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And in addition to what we heard the Attorney General say not too long again, we just saw the Joint Chief send a letter to the Hill reiterating that, that it would be illegal based on current law to transfer people to the U.S. \xc2\xa0So given what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard now, several officials say, surrounding the illegality of making a transfer like that, why are you not ruling out executive action to do something more at this point?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Because I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to take any of the President\xe2\x80\x99s options off the table. \xc2\xa0But that certainly is not what our focus is right now. \xc2\xa0Our focus right now is quite clear, given that we have presented to Congress exactly the plan that they asked for on exactly the time frame that they asked for. \xc2\xa0And what we\'re asking for is legitimate consideration be given to the plan. \xc2\xa0We\'ve got a very strong case to make about how the plan that we have put forward would save taxpayer dollars and make the American people safer. \xc2\xa0That\'s the essence of our plan, and it\'s time for members of Congress to put their own political considerations aside and actually consider what\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of the national security of the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, I know you\'re saying -- that\'s your focus. \xc2\xa0But it\'s hard to ignore what so many have said surrounding what\xe2\x80\x99s legal and what\xe2\x80\x99s not, including the Attorney General. \xc2\xa0So how can you still say that executive action is possible? \xc2\xa0That would put a severe limit on what the President could do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what I\'ve been clear about is that we are focused on congressional action and getting Congress to actually act on the plan that we have presented there today. \xc2\xa0If they do that, that would make any sort of discussion about the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions obsolete. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why we\'re going to go ahead and continue to put pressure on Congress to do the right thing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the President could still take executive action on Gitmo, is that what you\'re saying?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m saying that what we\'re focused on right now is Congress taking action. \xc2\xa0And I\'m not going to stand up here and unilaterally take any options off the table when it comes to the President\xe2\x80\x99s use of his executive authority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And lastly, speaking of action in Congress, McConnell now is saying that a hearing is not going to happen. \xc2\xa0It\'s now the consensus of those on the Judiciary Committee that it\'s just not going to happen. \xc2\xa0So how does this change the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reach-out to the Hill and your strategy in general?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I can tell you that since we last met here that the President did make some additional calls to members of Congress, including some Republicans, including people who served on the Judiciary Committee. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have specific names at this point. \xc2\xa0But that outreach continues and it will continue.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I would just observe that while Senator McConnell may claim some unanimity of opinion among Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, he cannot claim unanimity of opinion when it comes to Republicans in the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0The fact is we\'ve seen unambiguous statements from people like Senator Kirk and Senator Collins that they believe that the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee should get a fair hearing and a timely up or down vote. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI certainly value their opinion. \xc2\xa0I think Senator McConnell does, too. \xc2\xa0But I think the opinion that we all value the most is what\xe2\x80\x99s required by the United States Constitution. \xc2\xa0And the institution of the United States Senate has a duty to function and ensure that the Supreme Court of the United States has what\xe2\x80\x99s required to function as the Founders intended.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you still think there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance that this -- that hearings would happen?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Absolutely. \xc2\xa0Again, based on what people like Senator Kirk, Senator Collins; I know that Senator Coats has also indicated that he believes that -- he said that \xe2\x80\x9cif the President nominates someone which is his choice, I think that person would deserve a hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Senator Blunt said, \xe2\x80\x9cI certainly don\'t mind taking a vote on this issue.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Neither Senator Coats, nor Senator Blunt represents a state that President Obama won in the reelection of 2012. \xc2\xa0Neither of them would describe themselves as a moderate. \xc2\xa0Both of them are conservative Republicans, but both of them are out there saying publicly that if the President nominates somebody, they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to vote on them. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo again, I guess it will make for an interesting caucus meeting when Senator McConnell brings together the members of his Senate. \xc2\xa0Maybe they\xe2\x80\x99re having lunch right now. \xc2\xa0I guess --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- every member of the Judiciary Committee signed a letter saying no hearing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I\'m not sure -- I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the meeting, obviously. \xc2\xa0I was standing right here. \xc2\xa0I\'m not sure what Senator Kirk, Senator Collins, Senator Blunt or Senator Coats has to say about it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\'ll do a couple more hands in the back. \xc2\xa0Jordan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Back to Gitmo. \xc2\xa0We were told earlier today that there was outreach to relevant congressional parties on the White House\xe2\x80\x99s plan, and I was wondering if you could expand on which members were informed about the plan before it was released through the outreach and whether the President has personally called members of Congress to discuss the plan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Let me check on that for you and we\'ll see if we can get you some more details. \xc2\xa0I know that there was extensive congressional consultation that occurred before the plan was formally released. \xc2\xa0But let me see if I can get you some greater detail about how exactly that took place. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSarah.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0As you mentioned, you\xe2\x80\x99ve given Congress the plan that it asked for, as you put it. \xc2\xa0And the administration is citing kind of the broad ban on spending money to move detainees to the U.S. as why you can\'t give a specific site. \xc2\xa0But the same law, the NDAA, Section 1035 says that this report that you have given, that Congress asked for, says that the report is supposed to include the specific facility or facilities that are intended to be used or modified to use, et cetera, et cetera. \xc2\xa0So why -- how are you fulfilling Congress\xe2\x80\x99s request for that specific data?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think what this highlights that every year in the NDAA, the can\'t writes in language that specifically prohibits the administration from undertaking plans that would lay the groundwork for bringing individuals from the prison at Guantanamo Bay into the United States. \xc2\xa0So I think you have highlighted yet another example of congressional dysfunction that they have written a law that includes varying guidance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the truth is there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason we have to sort of go through all of this. \xc2\xa0Why don\'t we just have members of Congress who actually are willing to put politics aside, focus on the best interest of the United States, and have a serious conversation with the administration about the most effective way for us to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, save taxpayer dollars, and remove a recruiting tool that we know that ISIL is eager to use?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, Senator McCain, who you have noted, when he ran against the President, said that he also supported closing Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s now the Armed Services Committee Chairman. And he said that the report today is a vague menu of options, not a credible plan for closing Guantanamo, let alone a coherent policy to deal with future terrorist detainees. \xc2\xa0Is Senator McCain just being cynical and political?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask him how he arrived at his conclusions. \xc2\xa0But again, I think the facts here are pretty clear. \xc2\xa0We\'ve made clear exactly how the American people can save money by closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0We\'ve made clear that this is something that can be done safely, consistent with our national security interests. \xc2\xa0In fact, we\'ve made clear that it would actually enhance the national security of the United States to pursue this approach.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, it\'s going to be up to Congress to decide whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to enjoy the benefits of the outline that we have put forward. \xc2\xa0Are they going to put forward their own plan? \xc2\xa0There really hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been much of a discussion about that. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s a congressional plan to try to achieve these goals. \xc2\xa0After all, we know there are a lot of Republicans who are running for President who are saying that they would make foreign policy decisions based on the advice they get from our military leadership, consistent with the need to cut government and cut wasteful government spending, and to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything to make America strong, and to protect our national security. \xc2\xa0If we\xe2\x80\x99re making decisions based on that criteria, Congress would implement this plan today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last question. \xc2\xa0In the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Cuba, my understanding is that he\xe2\x80\x99s not planning to visit the base -- either the soldiers or the prison. \xc2\xa0Can you confirm that? \xc2\xa0It was a little vague in some earlier conversations. \xc2\xa0And was it considered and dismissed, or was it just never seen as a possibility?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the details yet on the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Cuba. \xc2\xa0At this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that the President will go to the base at Guantanamo Bay, but let me check on that for you and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can confirm that in advance of a more full schedule.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJulie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0The President seemed pretty frustrated today. \xc2\xa0He talked for a long time about his plan that he\xe2\x80\x99s sending to Congress to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0He talked about the number of hours he spent working on this, and how many calls he has fielded with complaints from allies. \xc2\xa0And it was obviously a major promise of his campaign. \xc2\xa0He is now in the final year in office, and he basically acknowledged the impossible politics -- and you referenced it earlier -- no members of Congress want these prisoners in their districts or states. \xc2\xa0So I wondered if you could just give us a sense of -- get us into his head a little bit about how he feels. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s got 10 months left, and this is still an issue that he does not seem to be able to get rid of. \xc2\xa0And sort of how he\xe2\x80\x99s looking at this now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the way the President sees this is he sees it as an opportunity that he has to prevent a problem that was passed on to him from being passed on to the next President. \xc2\xa0And he takes that approach not knowing who the next President is going to be. \xc2\xa0His view is that the interests of the United States would not be enhanced by passing this problem on to either a Democrat or a Republican in the Oval Office. \xc2\xa0And the President has acknowledged that the politics of this are tough and that there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity, given that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any more elections to run, Vice President Biden doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any more elections to run, and that means they have some clarity of judgment that they can use here to do the right thing for the American people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, again, in a lot of ways, what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for from Congress is, even if there is a reluctance on the part of some members of Congress or many Republicans -- many members of Congress -- from cooperating with the administration on this, the least they could do is actually just remove the obstructions. \xc2\xa0Just get out of the way so the people who are actually trying to act in the best interest of the American people can do their job. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s in some ways what the President is seeking. \xc2\xa0If Congress feels like they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be involved in this effort, as I mentioned, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of good reason for them to want to be involved in it -- it would enhance our national security and it would save taxpayer dollars. \xc2\xa0But if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, they can just remove the obstructions and allow the United States -- to allow the President of the United States, his national security team, and our uniformed leaders in the military take the steps that we believe are necessary to enhance our national security. \xc2\xa0We could do all that, save taxpayer dollars. \xc2\xa0That would be the right thing to do, and the President is hopeful that he can get that done before he leaves office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just back on Biden\xe2\x80\x99s comments for a moment on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0He seemed to be making the argument in 1992 that even though he had in the past as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee moved along Republican nominees and was willing to in a future administration, that there was something about the election year and being in the thick of a campaign that made it inappropriate to fill a vacancy either by the President or the Senate moving it. \xc2\xa0So I wonder, can you explain to us what is different from June 1992 to February 2016? \xc2\xa0Why is the standard different?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the biggest difference is there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a vacancy. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s not a single thing that then-Senator Biden said that prevented the Senate fulfilling its constitutional obligations. \xc2\xa0And in fact, I think, again, he made clear later in his speech that if the President consults and cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selections absent consultation, then his nominees \xe2\x80\x9cmay enjoy my support\xe2\x80\x9d as did Justices Kennedy and Souter. \xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy was confirmed in an election year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo again, when it comes to evaluating the performance of members of the United States Senate, Vice President Biden has got a record that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty tough to beat. \xc2\xa0And this is not a -- as I mentioned, we\xe2\x80\x99re simply asking the United States Senate in 2016 to do what Senator Biden did himself in 1987 and 1988, when he gave fair consideration to a nominee that was put forward by a President in the other party. \xc2\xa0And Vice President Biden advanced the process so that that individual could be confirmed in an election year. \xc2\xa0We believe that the Senate this time should do the same thing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it was after that that he said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that was going to be appropriate in the election year in which he was speaking.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I think it depends on which part of the remarks you take a look at. \xc2\xa0And what\xe2\x80\x99s undeniable is there was not a vacancy. \xc2\xa0There was nothing that Senator Biden said that prevented the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional duty.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We just didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean for that to be followed at all.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there in 1992; I was a senior in high school. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to assess with a lot of clarity exactly what the dynamics were. \xc2\xa0But what is clear is that there was no vacancy at the time. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing here that he said that prevented the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional duty. \xc2\xa0And in fact, in the same speech, then-Senator Biden made clear that he would be open to consultation with the White House that was controlled by the other party in fair consideration of the nominee that was put forward by the President of the other party. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re asking the Senate to do this time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, could you just tell us a little more about the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the State Department tomorrow? \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we heard about that previously before Brett mentioned it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s right. \xc2\xa0So the President periodically has convened meetings with his national security team to discuss the ongoing effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0The President will convene the meeting -- or the next meeting on Thursday at the State Department. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOver the last few months, the President has convened these meetings not just in the Situation Room but in other places. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall the President went to the Pentagon, I believe it was either in November or December of last year, to have this meeting. \xc2\xa0I know there was a discussion about our counter-ISIL campaign at NCTC last year. \xc2\xa0And this week, the President will be convening the meeting at the State Department.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously, the State Department has been doing important work to try to reach this agreement -- or at least an understanding around a cessation of hostilities in Syria. \xc2\xa0So given the primacy of the work that\xe2\x80\x99s being done at the State Department right now, the President thought it made sense to convene the meeting over at the State Department this time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFrancesca, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Speaking of election year politics, I wanted to ask you about something the President said last week. \xc2\xa0Several times in here you have indicated that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t endorse in the Democratic primary, and the White House Chief of Staff even said last month that he\xe2\x80\x99ll see who the nominee is at the end of that primary process, that\xe2\x80\x99s not our job, and then he\xe2\x80\x99ll decide. \xc2\xa0But the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks during his press conference seem to suggest that he could endorse a Democratic candidate in the race. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cUltimately, I will probably have an opinion on it based both on being a candidate of hope and change and on a President who has got some nicks and cuts and bruises from getting stuff done over the last seven years.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo my question is: \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s changed recently that the President is now suggesting that he could actually endorse in this primary?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think if you go back and take a look at the way that I\xe2\x80\x99ve described the situation is that we don\'t currently have a plan for the President to make public his preference in the Democratic presidential nomination process. \xc2\xa0The President will fill out a ballot and vote absentee in Illinois. \xc2\xa0The Illinois primary is March 15th. \xc2\xa0So he\xe2\x80\x99s got to make a decision pretty soon, if he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t already.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so the real question is just whether or not we\'re going to make that public. \xc2\xa0 Right now our plan is not to make that public. \xc2\xa0But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out the possibility that we may decide to make that public at some point in the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks for your clarification.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Thanks, guys. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Who\xe2\x80\x99s on the short list?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s that? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Who\xe2\x80\x99s on the short list? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to come with some of that material tomorrow. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:25 P.M.
