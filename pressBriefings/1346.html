GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 As we get started today we\'re going to hear from a couple of different people that are working on the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response to the oil spill in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 First you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from Admiral Allen, and then we\'ll be happy to take your questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I will say as a point of introduction, though he rarely needs an introduction, he would normally be in Louisiana were it not for today.\xc2\xa0 His vice commandant is retiring.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow he is leaving the command of the Coast Guard.\xc2\xa0 But the President and the Secretary of Homeland Security have asked him to delay his retirement and continue to serve as the National Incident Commander for the spill in the Gulf.</p>\n<p>So let me turn this over to Admiral Allen.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for the opportunity to talk with you here today.\xc2\xa0 I thought I might start out by giving you a little background on the command-and-control system and how oil spills work.\xc2\xa0 But first let me premise -- I would underscore what he said -- I\xe2\x80\x99d much rather be down in Louisiana, the Gulf Coast, dealing with this problem down there because I know it\xe2\x80\x99s of concern to everybody.\xc2\xa0 And as somebody who has worked on the water all his life, nothing is more disturbing than oil on any water in our country.</p>\n<p>The current paradigm for responding to oil spills really dates back to the legislation that was passed after the Exxon Valdez, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.\xc2\xa0 It mandated a paradigm by which the responsible party or the spiller would be held accountable.\xc2\xa0 It also created a oil spill liability trust fund to fund responses where there was no responsible party, or to fund operations and have those funds recouped from the responsible party.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s premised on the country being divided up into areas for the purpose of developing contingency plans.\xc2\xa0 And we have these areas called captain of the port zones; those are the Coast Guard commanders that are responsible for that area.\xc2\xa0 They get together with the state and local stakeholders and they develop plans to protect the most sensitive areas within those areas, and they\xe2\x80\x99re called area contingency plans.\xc2\xa0 There is one for every single part of the coastline of the United States.\xc2\xa0 There is one that covers the Gulf Coast as well.</p>\n<p>When they have to activate a response, the local Coast Guard commander who is designated the federal on-scene coordinator coordinates with the state and local government and directs the responsible party in the cleanup.\xc2\xa0 If the spill was inland, EPA would be the federal on-scene coordinator.\xc2\xa0 The Coast Guard and EPA share that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This entire framework is called the national contingency plan, and it is how we have prosecuted oil spills ever since the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.\xc2\xa0 That is the way we have been prosecuting this case since the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon on the 20th of April.\xc2\xa0 Even in advance of the sinking of the drilling unit, we were staging equipment that was against the scenario we would have a worst-case spill.\xc2\xa0 And we started actually mobilizing equipment, salvage engineers and everything right after the event happened into the 21st of April.</p>\n<p>So the command-and-control structure down there right now is the commanding officer of the Coast Guard in New Orleans is the federal on-scene coordinator for the response.\xc2\xa0 We have elevated that responsibility to Mary Landry.\xc2\xa0 She is in Robert, Louisiana, and she is called an area unified commander.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s when you take one or more of these zones or these areas and you combine them under a larger command.</p>\n<p>So we have a single command in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 The commander is Rear Admiral Mary Landry.\xc2\xa0 She is supervising subsections.\xc2\xa0 One is New Orleans.\xc2\xa0 The other one is over in Mobile, and Mobile covers Mississippi, Alabama, and the western portion of Florida. There is another command at St. Petersburg, and another one in Key West and around up the East Coast.\xc2\xa0 At this point, they all, for the purpose of this response, report to the area command in Robert, Louisiana.</p>\n<p>At a higher level we have what we call a regional response team.\xc2\xa0 Those are all the federal players that have responsibilities for an oil spill response.\xc2\xa0 It would be Department of Interior, EPA, Coast Guard, NOAA.\xc2\xa0 And they look at resource requirements across a regional area.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s say if you had a decision of where to put boom between Mississippi, Alabama, or Louisiana, they would coordinate with the regional response team.</p>\n<p>If something gets large enough where there\xe2\x80\x99s a national issue about how much boom is in the entire country or where to move dispersants, it would come up to the national response team. And the national response team is the same players, except in Washington in the interagency.\xc2\xa0 So, for instance, the Coast Guard is on the national response team.\xc2\xa0 We co-chair it with EPA -- NOAA, Commerce, DOI, and so forth.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a way to bring up resource issues or policy issues that cannot be resolved at the lowest level, and work those all the way up the chain.</p>\n<p>There is also the allowance in the national contingency plan that if the resource adjudication process or the coordination becomes complicated -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated in this place -- in this case -- that the President has the option of declaring something called a spill of national significance.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is contained in the national contingency plan, and also have the option to designate a national incident commander, which the President and Secretary Napolitano have designated me.</p>\n<p>Now, this is not a policy.\xc2\xa0 This is a command-and-control structure.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s actually contained in the code of federal regulations that implement the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.\xc2\xa0 So when you hear us talk about responsible party, or the <br/>\nfederal on-scene coordinator, we\xe2\x80\x99re actually talking about legal definitions that are derived from statute -- the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 -- that are contained in 40 CFR 300.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are actual clear definitions, and I think sometimes we\xe2\x80\x99re losing the distinction of what a responsible party or federal on-scene coordinator are.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to go through and answer questions related to the spill response, especially as it relates to BP\xe2\x80\x99s role as a responsible party and the roles of the federal on-scene coordinator.</p>\n<p>Would you like me to add anything else, or would you like to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good intro.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll start with Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here, Admiral.\xc2\xa0 Let me start on that point about who\xe2\x80\x99s in charge and the quality of the response so far.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Salazar said yesterday, referring to BP, \xe2\x80\x9cIf we find that they\xe2\x80\x99re not doing what they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be doing, we\xe2\x80\x99ll push them out of the way appropriately.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What does that mean, \xe2\x80\x9cpush them out of the way\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 What more could be done?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that\'s more of a metaphor.\xc2\xa0 What we need to make sure is they execute their responsibilities, the responsible party, and we carry out our responsibilities and be accountable as the federal on-scene coordinators.\xc2\xa0 This is what we do, is if something is going -- if BP is applying resources, there is an operation being conducted, and we want it to be done some other way, they\xe2\x80\x99re issued an order by the federal on-scene coordinator, and they comply.\xc2\xa0 And there have been adjustments made all the way along.\xc2\xa0 And if I need to, I call Tony Hayward myself.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re the responsible party, but we have the authority to direct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So their role is still -- to make sure I have this right -- their role is still to be in charge of this operation, and the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s role is to be in charge of oversight, and that is not going to change?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I think I\'d differentiate \xe2\x80\x9cin charge.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 They are responsible for the cleanup, how that\'s effected.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, we are accountable, from the federal government side, to make sure they do it.\xc2\xa0 The law requires them, as the responsible party, to play a certain role -- to pay for it, to provide equipment, and so forth -- and particularly with trying to deal with the leak on the bottom of the ocean.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re 5,000 feet down.\xc2\xa0 BP or the private sector are the only ones that have the means to deal with that problem down there.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not government equipment that\'s going to be used to do that.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a way where private industry can address the problem with proper oversight by the federal government.\xc2\xa0 I would say it\xe2\x80\x99s less a case of \xe2\x80\x9cin charge.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there -- to this point, though, whether the government can do more, can it push BP out of the way if it feels like that company is not doing the job?\xc2\xa0 What is your response to that?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, to push BP out of the way would raise the question to replace them with what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that this government right now is doing the best it can?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been involved with the technical decisions made, especially in relation to deal with the leak, and they are pressing ahead.\xc2\xa0 We are overseeing them.\xc2\xa0 They\'re exhausting every technical means possible to deal with that leak.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a solution?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 There are a number of solutions and they\'re doing them in sequence based on risk.\xc2\xa0 The ultimate solution is going to be to drill a relief well, take the pressure off that well and cap it.\xc2\xa0 That will be sometime in August.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t want to wait that long.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re trying a series of interventions, starting with the insertion tube to evacuate the oil that we can, the top kill shot that will be scheduled for I believe early Wednesday now to try and force mud down the blowout preventer into the well to stop the pressure so it can be sealed.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s a series of events.\xc2\xa0 They\'re trying the least risky ones first and moving on down.\xc2\xa0 But we cannot stop.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to try every means at our -- every means that we can to stop this leak.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral, you said before that you -- and you mentioned just now Mr. Hayward -- you said before that you trust him.\xc2\xa0 Other administration officials don\'t seem to share that trust.\xc2\xa0 Is there a difference between your view and others in the administration about BP and its CEO?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I think there may be difference in how we characterize our interactions with him.\xc2\xa0 You have a case where this problem is going to be solved with the private sector working with the federal government.\xc2\xa0 If you don\'t have confidence in what each party is doing, you don\'t have the ability to call and speak frankly -- and you can characterize that as trust, being responsible, having credibility, whatever you want -- that has to be present for this to be successful.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s my responsibility as the National Incident Commander to create those relationships and ensure they\'re maintained.\xc2\xa0 And I judge personally my communications with anybody, including Tony Hayward, and I would characterize when I tell him something, he says he understands it, he follows up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said, as well in response to Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question if BP were to get out of the way, it raises the question of who would step in.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Suttles, today, from BP said, it would be within the government\xe2\x80\x99s area to step in if it wanted to.\xc2\xa0 What does that mean?\xc2\xa0 Could the government step in?\xc2\xa0 Does it have the capacity to do so?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I hear everybody saying it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what that term really means.\xc2\xa0 I know that to work down there you need remotely operated vehicles; you need to do very technical work at 5,000 feet.\xc2\xa0 You need equipment and expertise that\'s not generally within the government -- federal government in terms of competency, capability or capacity.\xc2\xa0 There may be some other way to get it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m the National Incident Commander and right now the relationship with BP is the way I think we should move forward.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions.\xc2\xa0 First of all, if the EPA -- and maybe this is a question for Ms. Browner -- but if the EPA says to BP, we don\'t want you using this dispersant, we think it\xe2\x80\x99s too toxic, and BP says, okay, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t care, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do what we want to do anyway, then what avenue does the federal government have to challenge that?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 You want to do the first part, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the second?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Yes, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you do the first part?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 If we want BP to do something, even if it appears they do not want to do it, they are issued an administrative order by the federal on-scene coordinator that has the effect of law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re not doing it, right?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a series of meetings going on.\xc2\xa0 They started last night.\xc2\xa0 Lisa Jackson is in the area and there will be a press advisory or I guess a press conference later today at -- what time?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it is --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 I want to say 4:30 p.m. or 4:45 p.m. Gulf Coast time.\xc2\xa0 And so they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to understand:\xc2\xa0 Are there alternatives available?\xc2\xa0 How rapidly can they be made available? Are they in fact less toxic?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just a number of issues that have to be worked through.\xc2\xa0 But as the Admiral says, there is a way to stop them if that\xe2\x80\x99s where this discussion ends.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Admiral Allen, the governor of Louisiana, Bobby Jindal, has said that on May 2nd he requested 3 million feet of absorbent boom, 5 million feet of hard boom, 30 jack-up barges, and so far all they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten is less than 800,000 feet of boom. In addition, he said a couple weeks ago he asked the Army Corps of Engineers to approve an emergency plan to set up barriers at highlands and they\xe2\x80\x99re still waiting to hear.\xc2\xa0 He seemed very, very frustrated that the federal government was not being responsive to the requests that he had specifically made.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to divide that in two parts, the boom and the barrier island, if I could.\xc2\xa0 Regarding -- and by the way, the last couple days I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to Governor Jindal every day trying to fill him in on where we\xe2\x80\x99re going and what the status of operations is.</p>\n<p>Regarding boom, our baseline that we start from for boom decisions has to do with those area contingency plans that I explained earlier.\xc2\xa0 Within those plans, they identify the most sensitive resources that need to be protected within a particular geographic area.\xc2\xa0 And this is based on consultation with the people that are actually responsible for the resources, whether at the Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife, NOAA, and so forth.</p>\n<p>Those plans preexisted this spill.\xc2\xa0 So what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done is we\xe2\x80\x99ve said we want everybody to go back and validate their area contingency plans and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to source the first boom we\xe2\x80\x99ve got available to cover those areas.\xc2\xa0 And beginning -- since we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where the spill was going to go when it started -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer a monolithic spill; it\xe2\x80\x99s omni-directional, it\xe2\x80\x99s in patches, huge circumference, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got tar balls; some places we got oil actually coming to shore around southern Louisiana.\xc2\xa0 So we have actually sourced boom for a very wide area to meet the minimum requirements of the area contingency plan sensitive areas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If more oil is coming and you identify extra requirements, then we are trying to fill those.\xc2\xa0 But we thought the most equitable way to do it would be to use the plans that the states were part of approving as a baseline distribution of boom, and then move beyond that based on the justification and requirements of where the oil was coming to shore.</p>\n<p>So we are doing that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re taking care of the area contingency plan first, and additional requests that are coming in, we are responding to those.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much boom do you have to give out?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- we put out a daily boom report every day.\xc2\xa0 But I think we are well over 2 million feet deployed.\xc2\xa0 And we have a warehousing -- a virtual warehouse set up in Louisiana, and we distribute to the entire area.\xc2\xa0 One of the things we -- when we started out, everybody was ordering their own boom.\xc2\xa0 And we actually had these different areas competing against each other and even bidding up the price, in some cases.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually gone to a centralized distribution system for the entire coast that\xe2\x80\x99s coordinated in conjunction with area command in Robert, Louisiana.\xc2\xa0 And we can give you the details.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just answer my question about the Army Corps of Engineers?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you my characterization of the Army\xe2\x80\x99s side, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into too much detail because it\xe2\x80\x99s a process they own.\xc2\xa0 The state has applied for a permit that would take a look at establishing a system of barrier islands and berm structures -- one to the east of the Mississippi River on the Chandeleur Islands or Breton Sound; the other one basically from around Grand Isle over to the west -- to the east towards the Mississippi River.</p>\n<p>The Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating that right now.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the cost and the schedule, the feasibility, the engineering issues associated with it, where the sediments would come from -- you have to go get them from someplace to deposit them there.\xc2\xa0 What are the implications of where you remove the sediments from?\xc2\xa0 How high do you have to build the berms if you were going to build them and what is the ecological impact associated with that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They have not finished that review.\xc2\xa0 But what I promised Governor Jindal personally in a conversation is we would start looking at it now, so we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait for the Corps of Engineers to hear the Coast Guard -- what do you think about it. We\xe2\x80\x99re looking at it in parallel with them.</p>\n<p>We need to understand, though, that building a set of barrier islands and berms that large is going to take a very, very long time even by the state\xe2\x80\x99s own estimate -- six to nine months in some cases -- and a significant amount of resources associated with that that might be applied elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at everything having to do with the proposal.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch frequently with Governor Jindal.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to drive to a decision that we can announce as soon as we can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral, early on, what kind of reassurances did BP give you about being able to stop this leak quickly?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 The discussion has mainly revolved around the fact that the technologies that are being employed here are not novel or new.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the mistakes that\'s being made by a lot of folks who don\'t understand the industry -- and I\'ve learned more about it, frankly, since I started -- is that the procedures to try and stop this blowout or this wellhead down there are the same that they would use on land or anyplace else.</p>\n<p>The problem is exacerbated and much more complicated by the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s 5,000 feet below the surface; there\xe2\x80\x99s no human access; the only information we have down there is what is derived from remotely operated vehicles or other sensors that are down there.\xc2\xa0 So everything we see is a two-dimensional video representation of what that particular -- or what we can see at any particular time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So instead of going out and putting some new hoses onto a well and jamming mud down it on the surface, you have to replace the umbilical cord that existed in the riser pipe that was there to begin with and completely rebuild that system, then test every section of it until you\'re ready for that top kill shot.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the things that are going on are absolutely logical; they\xe2\x80\x99re consistent with oilfield engineering and practices that are done on land.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re just being done in a place where it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been done in the history of oil drilling before.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that, but what did they give you in terms of a timeline as to -- early on -- as to when they thought they could get it capped?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, the ultimate timeline is August for the relief well, for the permanent solution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they told you that early on?\xc2\xa0 They said, we may not be able to do this until August?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 They said the ultimate solution is to drill a relief well and cap the current well and that will be at least 90 days -- we\'re looking generally at August right now.\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, there\xe2\x80\x99s a series of sequential steps they have tried.\xc2\xa0 And you saw the collection device that did not work, the insertion tube that appears to be working and having some effect, and now they\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the top kill -- or putting under pressure this very, very heavy mud that would stop the column of hydrocarbon so they can seal it.\xc2\xa0 After that, there are a series of other steps they\xe2\x80\x99re considering.</p>\n<p>These were all laid out.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been provided to us.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Salazar, Secretary Chu have seen them.\xc2\xa0 There are Gantt charts associated with dates.\xc2\xa0 The dates have slipped to the right in some cases because these systems are working out as they deploy to the seabed.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s been total visibility of that since they started proposing the way forward.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Dan, if I can add to that -- the Admiral just mentioned Secretary Chu at the Department of Energy.\xc2\xa0 Understanding that when talking about oil, the Department of Energy\xe2\x80\x99s only purview over oil is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but as a result of the fact that we just happen to have a Nobel Prize-winning physicist on our staff -- along with hundreds of others of the brightest minds in all of the world working out of the National Laboratories -- Secretary Chu has been in the command center and has spent hours on the phone with the scientists from the private sector as well as with the company in order to go through a lot of different calculations to set up a process so that this can work -- or this has the best chance of working on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they basically laid out all these different steps:\xc2\xa0 This is what we\'re going to try first.\xc2\xa0 Then if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work we\'re going to try this.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately August may be the only sure solution.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I think you would generally characterize that they have four or five what I would call lines of effort.\xc2\xa0 The overarching line of effort is the relief well.\xc2\xa0 Before that they have tried the capture devices, piped oil to the top; there were two evolutions of that and then finally the insertion tube is working.\xc2\xa0 The next one is to try and kill the well, as they would say.\xc2\xa0 That\'s going to be done by inserting a very high pressure of heavy mud to drive the hydrocarbons down so they can seal it.\xc2\xa0 If that does not work, they have two options after that.\xc2\xa0 One is to sever the marine riser pipe and attempt to put a valve in.</p>\n<p>They\xe2\x80\x99re not doing that first because when you sever that marine riser pipe you don\'t know how many hydrocarbons are going to come out and how much oil is being held by the fact that that riser pipe is bent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>After that they could take the lower marine riser package which sits above the blowout preventer and just physically remove it and put a whole new blowout preventer right on top of it.\xc2\xa0 One of those is staged on the DD2 that\'s drilling the second relief well out there and is ready to go as the backup to the current actions they are trying.\xc2\xa0 So they have a series of events with backup actions behind them, and they\xe2\x80\x99re sequentially trying the ones that involve the least risk in that order.</p>\n<p>I was out on the rigs last Thursday.\xc2\xa0 I actually went through -- this was my second trip out there -- I looked at the blowout preventer, was briefed on their plans.\xc2\xa0 They make sense. They\xe2\x80\x99re going in sequence, and they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with problems as they arise.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I would say this.\xc2\xa0 The relief well is the permanent solution.\xc2\xa0 So even the injection of the heavy mud and the ceiling is still going to be -- is done in place for the relief wells, which is the ultimate, more permanent solution.\xc2\xa0 And Carol reminded me that we instructed them not to simply drill one but two relief wells so that we had some margin on that.</p>\n<p>Helen, do you have something?\xc2\xa0 Are you good?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a blame game going on?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 If there is, I\xe2\x80\x99m not playing it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Helen, first and foremost, we are trying to do everything, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, human and technologically possible, first to plug this leak, and secondly, to deal with what has spilled and both the environmental and economic impacts of that oil, understanding, as Admiral Allen said, that because of the nature of the dispersants, the currents, the wind, the weather -- we are watching where this oil moves, the degree to which that it could get into the Loop Current, and a whole host of other things, in order to get a hold of this.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Helen, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be glib --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Louisiana cooperating -- Jindal?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be glib.\xc2\xa0 Whenever there\xe2\x80\x99s oil on the water, nothing good happens, and nobody should be satisfied.\xc2\xa0 And when oil is on the water, it\xe2\x80\x99s an insult to the environment, quite frankly.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working very, very closely with the state of Louisiana.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All the states down there have needs that go beyond their area contingency plans they would like to see met.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of adjudicating the resources you have at the time.\xc2\xa0 But we are involved with these folks every day, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here, Admiral.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, plugging the leak is number one at this point.\xc2\xa0 And I do understand, I think we all understand, that it\xe2\x80\x99s BP that has the expertise and the equipment.\xc2\xa0 But what exactly is the role of the federal government in plugging the leak?\xc2\xa0 To what degree are you working with, commanding, offering advice, bringing in the best minds?\xc2\xa0 What is the role of the federal government in plugging the leak?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I\'d say we\xe2\x80\x99re actually defining that as we go, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve never dealt with a scenario like this.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been dealing with oil spills for over 30 years.\xc2\xa0 This is an unprecedented anomalous event.\xc2\xa0 And as we move forward and we look at how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to control the leak ultimately, it requires BP to say this is a standard industry practice.\xc2\xa0 Before they go forward and do that, they consult with us.\xc2\xa0 We have a veto authority if we think we don\'t want to do it, keeping in mind they own the means of production.\xc2\xa0 We ask a lot of hard questions.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you some of the sessions have been inquisitorial in nature regarding the assumptions they\'re making on pressures -- thresholds inside the pipes and all that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess that\'s one of the questions --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, let me just reiterate, that\'s the -- one of the things that the Admiral just said -- the reason some of that inquisition is taking place, is Secretary Chu and others -- scientists from the National Laboratories -- Secretary Chu and others will be going back down to Houston tomorrow, and have been working throughout this process on having the best ideas come forward, tried, worked out on paper, so that they can be executed to stop this leak.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 The term I would use is due diligence.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just said they own the means of production.\xc2\xa0 But that could change, the government could simply -- the President could simply decide that we now own -- you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do the work, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to tell you how to use the people and the equipment here.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that true?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 That may be -- I don\'t know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer.\xc2\xa0 That may be true.\xc2\xa0 That wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be my recommendation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why -- Secretary Salazar has said that he does not have complete confidence in BP.\xc2\xa0 He said he\xe2\x80\x99s not sure they know what they\'re doing.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 They have the means of production.\xc2\xa0 They have the logistics in place.\xc2\xa0 They have the ROVs that are down there.\xc2\xa0 We are jointly operating in their command post out of Houston.\xc2\xa0 Everybody that has a stake in the fight is there.\xc2\xa0 And I am satisfied with the coordination that\'s going on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think Secretary Salazar is right -- I think he\xe2\x80\x99s probably exhibiting the immense amount of frustration we all feel, and that we need to keep pressure on and make sure they are accountable and doing their jobs.\xc2\xa0 As it stands right now, at least in my opinion, the means of production is in the hands of BP; they just need to do their job.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you say the federal government is monitoring what BP is doing?\xc2\xa0 Or is the federal government actively involved in plugging the leak?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 We are actively involved in the consultations regarding the technical issues related to the strategies provided by BP.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it fair to say have you --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 They are proffering, okay?\xc2\xa0 They are proffering, if that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did you -- it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that before.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And they -- and have you brought in these greatest minds in the business?\xc2\xa0 And --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, National Lab at Sandia --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the government has done this?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any assets that you would like to have that you do not have?\xc2\xa0 Have you asked for anything that you have not received from the federal government?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 No, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked for some pretty interesting things.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we have C-17s moving boom from Alaska.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re asking for -- we\xe2\x80\x99re using Navy sight-scan sonar.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re using Air Force planes to deliver dispersants.\xc2\xa0 We have a request for assistance process that was worked out with Assistant Secretary Stockton and our staff.\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s a really critical need, we go to him and he will actually seek a verbal order from Secretary Gates to move the defense equipment where it needs to go.\xc2\xa0 So I would say it\xe2\x80\x99s working very, very -- we have access to whatever we need.\xc2\xa0 The question is, the government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have everything we need to solve this problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no schism with the BP strategies and U.S.?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 The BP strategy as it related to leak control, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out, I think everybody understands that is the logical sequence.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to other industry leaders, just to go out and get triangulation, as we would say in nautical terms, and the feedback I\xe2\x80\x99m getting from these other captains of industry is the sequence of events is the sequence that should be followed in this type of case.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that -- Helen, if I can say that, I think everybody standing up here, everybody that works over there including the Oval Office, are we frustrated that there\xe2\x80\x99s still a hole in the bottom of the ocean leaking oil?\xc2\xa0 You bet.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be satisfied --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- have confidence --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be satisfied until it\xe2\x80\x99s plugged, until we\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt adequately with what has leaked both in the water column and on the surface.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question, do you have all the authority you need? Could you pick up the phone and call Secretary Gates or the President if you wanted to?\xc2\xa0 Do you have that kind of authority, and are you doing that?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, not routinely.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I have all the access I need to do my job, yes, sir.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral, can you -- do you have the same sense of satisfaction with what BP is now doing onshore as this oil is coming in?\xc2\xa0 Can you explain a little bit now, now that it appears it\xe2\x80\x99s almost sort of a two-pronged disaster with oil that\xe2\x80\x99s coming onshore, what the federal government is doing there, what BP\xe2\x80\x99s role is in that?\xc2\xa0 Obviously the technical stuff having to do with the hole is one aspect of this.\xc2\xa0 What role is BP playing onshore?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, that\xe2\x80\x99s a great question.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there are three fronts.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the emissions at the bottom of the ocean.\xc2\xa0 We have where the oil is coming to the surface and trying to fight it as far offshore as we can -- you\xe2\x80\x99d rather deal with it there before it even gets close to shore -- and then how you deal when it makes contact with shore.\xc2\xa0 And the three kind of distinct operations require different sets of -- types of capability.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re fighting a three-front war basically at once.</p>\n<p>If I were to give you an area where I\xe2\x80\x99ve had more conversations with BP than any other, it\xe2\x80\x99s been on the difference between wholesale and retail.\xc2\xa0 BP does wholesale really good as far as massing logistics, moving stuff around, getting it into the warehouses.\xc2\xa0 That last mile of retail, where you get the siting of the oil, you got to get the boom -- you got to coordinate all that, that\xe2\x80\x99s where the formation has got to be tightened up.\xc2\xa0 And I had a conversation with Tony Hayward this weekend on that.</p>\n<p>So I would say we have more of a play, need to exert more pressure and are exerting more pressure on the retail end where that boom actually hits the water.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to deal with the resources there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re sort of the first responders on the cleanup as well?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I understand on the -- I mean, I guess --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 We have what we call shore cleanup assist teams, and they\xe2\x80\x99re actually -- they\xe2\x80\x99re made up of a combination of federal, state, and local contractors, BP representatives, because you need almost everybody there to kind of coordinate what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a multifunctional team, multi-disciplined team.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re staffed by the local federal on-scene coordinator.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 In the way you said that on the -- dealing with the whole, it sort of -- BP has the technical expertise and you guys have veto power.\xc2\xa0 Is the role the same here on the cleanup?\xc2\xa0 Or is this a case where the government is sort of pushing BP?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I would say on the shore cleanup side, we have more degrees of freedom and more capability and competency we can bring to bear and a greater, wider set of authorities allow us to effect the outcome than on the sea floor -- that\xe2\x80\x99s true.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you have less confidence in BP in how they\xe2\x80\x99re handling this?\xc2\xa0 Or is it just --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s further away from their central business competency.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these guys are drilling for oil.\xc2\xa0 This is an oil spill response.\xc2\xa0 And what has happened, quite frankly, in the last 20 years -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s a phenomenon of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 -- we have created an industry in this country called oil spill response organizations, or OSROs.\xc2\xa0 We actually created the demand for companies who would build oil spill equipment and could be contracted to clean it up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>A lot of the work that\xe2\x80\x99s being done out there has been done by these oil spill response organizations.\xc2\xa0 It was anticipated that that would happen and as a result of the act, there would be a reason for them to capitalize on the market.\xc2\xa0 So we use a lot of folks that are not BP or Coast Guard to do these things.\xc2\xa0 They are contracted under -- BP paying for it -- a paradigm.\xc2\xa0 But then it all has to be coordinated.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s where there\xe2\x80\x99s a larger role for us there than there probably is on the seabed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So BP does not have -- call the shots, essentially, on this?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not sort of the --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 No, but they\xe2\x80\x99re involved in the execution.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem there, then we can bring our authorities to bear, and we do.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, let me add one other aspect to what the Admiral said about what we\xe2\x80\x99re also working through, and that is changing the liability law in Congress and lifting that cap, and setting it to a place that would ensure that the economic damages that are currently capped at $75 million, per the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, recognize the breadth of this disaster.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment, Robert, really quickly on the New York Times story about the -- whether the -- is there a moratorium in place right now on new drilling, or not?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Carol is better on that.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 There is.\xc2\xa0 The President has said no new holes.\xc2\xa0 Let me tell you what --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what are these permits?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 So what the Times appears to be talking about are modifications to existing permits.\xc2\xa0 It is quite routine where you\xe2\x80\x99re currently drilling and you need to make a modification, you\xe2\x80\x99ve encountered something that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate, and so you go back in -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s called a permit, but I think the better way to think about it is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a modification to an existing permit.</p>\n<p>There are -- in addition -- so there\xe2\x80\x99s that going on.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Times is reporting on.\xc2\xa0 There are 23 permits out there for new drilling activities that are not -- have not begun.\xc2\xa0 So what the President said is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to stop; those have been stopped.\xc2\xa0 There were two that were issued shortly after the accident.\xc2\xa0 Those have also been stopped.\xc2\xa0 So all of the deepwater permits that were not currently drilling are not going forward at this point in time.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 Have you -- you talked about what would the alternative be if BP was moved aside.\xc2\xa0 Have you considered hiring another oil company, like Chevron, or an oil spill contractor to take over day-to-day response from BP?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 When I have the CEO of a large petroleum company and oil drilling company tell me they would be following the same sequence of events, that tells me there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be anything to be gained by doing that.\xc2\xa0 And what they\'re doing is largely in line with industry standards.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just made immensely -- exponentially more difficult at 5,000 feet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So have you actually had those discussions with other oil companies?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell ---</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I will not attribute.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the second one, are you looking at a contingency plan in case the relief wells themselves don\'t work?\xc2\xa0 We were talking to some contractors today who said that\'s not a hundred percent sure either.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think everybody would -- nobody should give a hundred percent guarantee on anything associated with this incident until it is done.\xc2\xa0 I have not had a conversation with BP beyond the two relief wells.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been talk there potentially could be a third relief well.\xc2\xa0 Those are discussions we have not had yet.\xc2\xa0 The focus right now is get the two wells that are under construction started, and then do everything we can to minimize the leakage right now in advance of closing out the wells permanently.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral, you said it would not be your recommendation to change -- for the United States government or you to be in charge of every aspect of this and to push BP out of the way.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying, sir, that if the President said, this has gone on too long, it\xe2\x80\x99s day 35, Admiral, take it over, you would argue against that to the President?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 No, any military leader would give his best military advice to the President and then follow orders.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So -- but your recommendation to us, who you don\'t have to follow our orders, would be that -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll call you guys the ex officio committee in charge of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But your recommendation -- but you said a minute ago that your recommendation would be against that.\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate on that?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 What I said was -- you\xe2\x80\x99re moving into a hypothetical case.\xc2\xa0 What I said was, given the operations as we understand them now and the lines of effort that are being accomplished by BP, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to make a change.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is it taking so long, sir?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 It is very difficult.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s 5,000 feet below the surface, and it\xe2\x80\x99s never been done before.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral, are you saying the federal government is doing everything it can be doing and that BP is not doing?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 BP has provided a series of proposed actions to address not only the permanent capping of the well, but how to deal with the leakage in between time.\xc2\xa0 They provide us those lines of effort with Gantt charts, key dates on when they\'re going to be accomplished.\xc2\xa0 Those are briefed to Secretary Salazar, all the senior leadership.\xc2\xa0 We asked a lot of questions about them and we\xe2\x80\x99re following them.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the reason we are -- and maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake to set a date saying the top kill will be done on Tuesday and now it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be Wednesday, because they are sequentially starting to light off these systems and bring pressure down the pipes -- if they find a faulty valve and have to replace it with an ROV, that\'s maybe 12 or 18 hours added on to it.</p>\n<p>The sequence is going as planned as we discussed following the very, very detailed questions that were provided by Secretary Salazar and Secretary Chu a week or so ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that on the permit modification, if I could ask, Ms. Browner, given what\xe2\x80\x99s happened, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be go back and revisit these modifications?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President said is no new holes until we get through the 30-day report.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this report will be made available later this week, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make a set of decisions about how we proceed going forward.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the permitting, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand is that we are doing exactly what we said -- is that the people holding permits, they were holding them prior to this accident, are not moving forward with drilling at this point in time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I -- just real quick on the series of interventions that the Admiral talked about.\xc2\xa0 Is there no way technologically to have them more in a overlapping series of attempts?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Actually that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good question -- I asked that same one myself.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the best example of why that can\xe2\x80\x99t be done.\xc2\xa0 The first time we tried to put the insertion tube in, if you remember, it actually backed out and had to be put in twice.\xc2\xa0 The reason that happened was the ROV that was dealing with the insertion tube became entangled with the ROV that was trying to monitor the subsea dispersants at the leak site.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what they call sim-ops in the industry -- simultaneous operations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What you have there right now in a radius of 5,000 feet around that well site is 5,000 feet of crumpled riser pump, an upside-down mobile drilling unit, and on the surface anywhere between 12 and 20 ships, at any one particular time, anywhere between 10 and 14 ROVs operating.\xc2\xa0 Some of these things are going to have to be done in sequence because you can\xe2\x80\x99t operate on the same patient at the same time and do three different surgeries.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To put this in terminology that some editorial pages have used, Admiral and Ms. Browner, is it not possible to federalize this?\xc2\xa0 As a matter of law, can you not do that -- number one?\xc2\xa0 And number two, as a matter of practical solution creation, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do it even if you could?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m working without a net and without a lawyer, but the federal on-scene coordinator has the legal authority to direct a responsible party so I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s a legal rationale to do it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure there\xe2\x80\x99s a cause for action or a justification to consider it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ms. Browner, do you have anything to add?\xc2\xa0 Now, you implied earlier that these conversations about dispersants will be -- do you expect them to be resolved today?\xc2\xa0 Are you expecting a resolution?\xc2\xa0 And do you share some of the concerns that have been expressed to me and others here from environmentalists that the use of these dispersants could be creating a secondary environmental catastrophe that we may not fully understand or comprehend at this moment?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 We have the experts talking to each other right now.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s let them get through today.\xc2\xa0 They will be announcing where they are, whether a decision has been made, or where they are in those discussions this afternoon.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Can I just add a comment there?\xc2\xa0 A decision to use dispersants doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do away with the problem.\xc2\xa0 It means we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to accept the effect of the oil in the ocean rather on land.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a tradeoff of where the impact of the oil is going to be made.\xc2\xa0 And by dispersing it, it goes into much smaller pieces and can biodegrade rather quickly.\xc2\xa0 And another thing is, regardless of the relative toxicity of any dispersant, the difference in the toxicity between the dispersants and the oil is in order of magnitude.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral, Governor Jindal today asked if you could provide more readily available authority for those in the Coast Guard closest to the scene in parts of Louisiana that he can call or deal with directly.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us today if those authorities are going to be provided, and if that\'s a legitimate concern he\xe2\x80\x99s raised?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, he raised it and actually Secretary Napolitano raised it over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take a look at those teams that are being deployed and make sure that no matter where they\xe2\x80\x99re at, the direction there, there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody in a blue suit providing supervision or coordination related to that.\xc2\xa0 And I offered and have deployed an officer to Governor Jindal\xe2\x80\x99s staff to be that personal liaison between him, me, Secretary Napolitano or anybody else.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, that\'s our intent and we\'re moving there.\xc2\xa0 To the extent that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been, we will do that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral, you\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined very clearly how complicated this is and why it\xe2\x80\x99s taking so long.\xc2\xa0 But looking back on the events surrounding the incident itself, and now we\xe2\x80\x99re in this situation where you\xe2\x80\x99re pumping mud down, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about maybe stuffing garbage into this hole -- are you exasperated and dismayed that you\xe2\x80\x99re in this position?\xc2\xa0 And how, from what you\xe2\x80\x99ve learned, can you make sure that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again, the wells that are out there already?\xc2\xa0 Are they --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you ought to be exasperated or dismayed if there\xe2\x80\x99s any oil on the water.\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, it\xe2\x80\x99s an insult to the environment.</p>\n<p>That said, I believe -- and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call it garbage; it\xe2\x80\x99s called junk for a reason, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a very, very technical issue\xc2\xa0 -- it\xe2\x80\x99s pieces of tire that can tolerate certain pressures and temperatures to be able to clog up the blowout preventer.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, go ahead and finish your question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, it just seems like this is -- obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re improvising and the extent of this disaster and looking back on those incidents and what was not in place that could be drawn on now, how do you feel about that?\xc2\xa0 And is this not going to happen again?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Great question.\xc2\xa0 Okay, first of all, there was an assumption that these blowout preventers were failsafe.\xc2\xa0 We know that\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xc2\xa0 Okay?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody ever contemplated dealing with the scenario that we have right now where the blowout preventer would fail; you\xe2\x80\x99d have 5,000 feet of riser pipe, and then several leaks in that riser pipe from the residual oil coming out of the blowout preventer that did not close all the way.\xc2\xa0 I think we need to go back and look at our plans to respond and how we\xe2\x80\x99re positioned to do this in the future.\xc2\xa0 It just was not contemplated in the planning scenario.</p>\n<p>I would say this:\xc2\xa0 When the Oil Pollution Act was passed in 1990, it was only four or five years before that we had really moved into deep-sea drilling.\xc2\xa0 And the Oil Pollution Act was aimed at the problem of the day, which were large tankers.\xc2\xa0 And the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 has generally solved that problem.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nBut all the things that are in place regarding command and control and technology and so forth, like the use of dispersants and in situ burning that were major breakthroughs approved after the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, now are being done on such a large scale that we had never contemplated that at this point we\xe2\x80\x99d have 600,000 gallons of dispersant had been applied on the surface.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was ever envisioned when it was first decided let\xe2\x80\x99s try these alternate technologies.\xc2\xa0 So we are in a new era. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to learn something from this and we\xe2\x80\x99re probably going to have to adjust the rules.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, one more question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m from a part of California where 40 years ago there was a huge oil spill. There\xe2\x80\x99s still oil pumping out of the sea floor; there\xe2\x80\x99s tar balls on the beach every day.\xc2\xa0 Does this ever get entirely shut?\xc2\xa0 Do you ever close this hole?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are two issues in California, without getting into a lot of detail.\xc2\xa0 They have natural seepage out there that causes tar balls because there is oil that has open access to the subsurface.\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 We can do everything we can with what we control with manmade technology and how we use technology down there.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be from time to time natural seepages of oil.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just add from the President\xe2\x80\x99s perspective for this, Scott.\xc2\xa0 As you heard the Admiral say, the President\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint is failsafe has to mean that.\xc2\xa0 And if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, then we have to examine why it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t and the circumstances around that and have that impact our decisions going forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of the reviews that the government is looking through to look back at what got us to this point, we have the President\xe2\x80\x99s instruction for Secretary Salazar and the Department of Interior to report back to him.\xc2\xa0 That will be Thursday.\xc2\xa0 Thursday, the President will receive that report here at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is a separate national engineering report on this incident.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the President set up an independent commission headed by a former EPA commissioner and a former U.S. senator from Florida that will be charged with looked at both the role of industry and the role of government in regulating industry.\xc2\xa0 And the President I think has been very clear that we should not spare any expense in looking at both of those aspects of what may or may not have caused this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, a question for you and also the Admiral.\xc2\xa0 The President is receiving this report Thursday.\xc2\xa0 Should we expect the President to respond to it immediately in some fashion?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I expect that the President will speak to you all about it and answer some questions about it, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, all right.\xc2\xa0 And my question for the Admiral -- the two steps that are in the immediate future -- the top kill and the junk shot -- what do you think the odds of success are for both of them?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I quote Doug Suttles from BP who said this morning around 60 to 70 percent.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You describe sort of a disconnect between the dangers involved in drilling this deep and the sort of conventional means there are of dealing with a spill if it happened.\xc2\xa0 Ms. Browner, was the government aware of that disconnect when they allowed this kind of drilling to proceed, and they let it proceed?\xc2\xa0 Or were they misled by industry as to their capabilities in dealing with a disaster of this kind?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- and the Admiral can also speak to this -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not been an accident of this magnitude.\xc2\xa0 These preventers have worked.\xc2\xa0 Now, we need to understand why they didn\xe2\x80\x99t work and what we need to do going forward.\xc2\xa0 And as Robert just said, between the DOI report, the National Academy of Engineering, and the commission, the presidential commission, we should be able to get to the bottom of this.\xc2\xa0 And if there are changes that need to be made, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be made.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 When I was testifying before the Senate last week, I made three -- I identified three areas where I thought we might want to look at going forward to see if we could do better. <br/>\nOne of them is the overall inspection regulatory regime surrounding blowout preventers.\xc2\xa0 And maybe we can do a mandatory inspection, a regime that is regulated by somebody -- some independent third party like the American Bureau of Shipping would certificate drilling systems.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s an area we need to look at.</p>\n<p>The second one is on the Coast Guard side.\xc2\xa0 All of our inspection authorities for drilling units offshore are contained in Title 46 of the U.S. code.\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to go back -- as the outgoing commandant of the Coast Guard, I recommend to my successor to take a look at fire prevention standards, how we issue certificates of compliance -- this was a vessel registered in the Marshall Islands -- and make sure that there is no disparity between the standards that we\xe2\x80\x99re meeting under the international standards issued by the Marshall Islands and our certification of that; or maybe actually hands-on inspection rather than just taking the certificate as proof they\xe2\x80\x99re in compliance.</p>\n<p>And the third area, the spill response plans that are submitted to the Minerals Management Service as part of the permitting process I think need to be reviewed by the local Coast Guard commanders in terms of these area contingency plans that I mentioned earlier to see that they\xe2\x80\x99re better integrated.</p>\n<p>Those are the three areas I would give you.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mara, do you have something?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question if I can go off-topic.\xc2\xa0 Is that okay?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are a number of media reports saying that the White House and the Hill are meeting today in support of repealing \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Did those -- at the White House to endorse as Congress potentially takes up that issue this week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the reports.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen what exactly is being discussed.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that Congress is going to act this week.\xc2\xa0 If they decide to do that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly examine what those efforts are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just follow up on that really quickly, is it possible that some kind of compromise could be reached that the White House could endorse, and if so, what would the details of this compromise entail?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would -- let me go find out what they\xe2\x80\x99re discussing, and that might be pertinent to that answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know who initiated the meetings?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we did, but I will check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, has this incident influenced your thinking on the wisdom of drilling at 5,000 feet?\xc2\xa0 In other words, the Admiral talked about the difficulty in plugging these holes at this depth.\xc2\xa0 Going forward, what are your -- has this changed your thinking about drilling --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I can say that we have had a number of meetings with the President on this.\xc2\xa0 I do not believe that the President, as frustrated as he is, wants to make a judgment without the investigations that he\xe2\x80\x99ll see, again, starting Thursday, with the National Academy of Engineers and ultimately with the commission.</p>\n<p>I will say this, Peter.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say this, I repeated it just a minute ago to Scott and I also heard him say this -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say this a number of times:\xc2\xa0 Failsafe has to mean it.\xc2\xa0 As Carol said, we have been fortunate that blowout preventers have worked.\xc2\xa0 We have not been -- we have not dealt with in the Gulf something like this since 1983-1984 off the coast of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 The incident that Scott talked about was even before that, off the coast of California.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been fortunate.\xc2\xa0 We have to ensure that we have not become too trusting of those circumstances around not having had an accident.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s one of the things specifically that the President wants to be investigated.\xc2\xa0 We have to ensure -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say this -- investigate this relationship between the regulation at the Department of Interior -- and that\'s why Secretary Salazar has taken the steps to break apart MMS -- and ensure that we have the robust regulatory structure in place.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick follow-up, and I apologize if you\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed this before, but the Kentucky Senate candidate on the Republican side has talked about how \xe2\x80\x9caccidents happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We are actively involved in figuring out how that accident happened, because if how that accident happened doesn\xe2\x80\x99t inform how you move forward, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in a mine in West Virginia or a mine in Kentucky, or an oil well off the coast of Louisiana -- if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t inform what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing going forward -- I think the American people expect that there\xe2\x80\x99s a regulatory structure that\'s in place that ensures high safety standards and that companies are living up to those standards.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One for the Admiral.\xc2\xa0 I think you said on April 21st you started moving equipment even before the rig collapsed.\xc2\xa0 Why then are you still having to fly equipment in, I think you said by C-17, from Alaska, this late, a month later?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a great question.\xc2\xa0 It gets back to the statement I made earlier that this is not a monolithic spill. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a radius about 200 miles out there, and you have patches of very, very thick oil.\xc2\xa0 As the oil came to the surface, sometimes we were able to treat it with in-situ burning, sometimes mechanical skimming, sometimes dispersant, sometimes the wind changed directions -- so what you have is a number of spills that surfaced and went out omni-directional.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a general perimeter, and they tend to flow one way, depending on the prevailing wind.\xc2\xa0 But they are very, very spread out.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nBecause of that, early on we had to take precautions to protect from the central coast of Louisiana clear to Pensacola, Florida.\xc2\xa0 And if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to boom that entire area, you put a stress on the system.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re doing now is redeploying, taking a look at where the areas that are most needed are at, where the enemy is coming to shore basically, if you will, and redeploying and making sure we can move beyond the baseline level of sensitive areas that are identified with these plans and do more.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So were you not prepared on April 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th?\xc2\xa0 Were you just not prepared for how big this spill was going to get?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 We were prepared for a catastrophic spill.\xc2\xa0 As we got into the first four or five days, we started fanning out where we thought we had to put boom to the east and the west clear over, as I said, to Pensacola, Florida.\xc2\xa0 Originally, if you look at the plans for a blowout there, generally it\xe2\x80\x99s going to cut somewhere around Plackman\xe2\x80\x99s Parish, which has been impacted by it as the area you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to defend.\xc2\xa0 But because of the amount of time the oil has been out there, the amount of time the winds have changed -- when the winds come out of the west and start pushing it, or out of the south, we have to start thinking about Mississippi Sound and Alabama.\xc2\xa0 When they come out of the southeast, we have to think about Plackman\xe2\x80\x99s Parish.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s moved -- the direction of movement and the threat has changed on us, and it\xe2\x80\x99s required a larger area to be boomed that was contemplated and now we have to redeploy.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Remember, Steve, when we did our original briefing with the President\xe2\x80\x99s team -- with Secretary Napolitano before Admiral Allen was announced as the incident coordinator -- we were discussing at that point that oil would soon make landfall.\xc2\xa0 But as the Admiral said, because of wind and water currents, dispersants have broken stuff up.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re just now seeing the larger impacts of this, and because of that, moving resources around.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick follow.\xc2\xa0 Given the deep-water drilling in the Gulf, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t more of this equipment be based there rather than, say, on the west coast or in Alaska?\xc2\xa0 And will it be permanently located now in the Gulf Coast?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I think a reconciliation of the resources required by the plan will be ultimately employed across a much broader threat area than we\xe2\x80\x99d anticipated, as a natural reconciliation of any inquiry will be part of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Even as we have to take into account the environmental impacts of what surrounds it, obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re drilling in shallower water in a place like Alaska, but you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with a fundamentally different -- a fundamentally different environment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>John.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 And thank you, Ms. Browner and Admiral Allen, for being here today.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask both of you -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the complaints from the scientific community that it\xe2\x80\x99s been a problem operating with 10-year-old maps, and that government should spend the estimated $11 million it needs to update the environmental sensitivity maps.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that complaint?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d almost have to defer to Jane Lubchenco. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been involved in conference calls and press calls where she has raised the issue that resources in the past have constrained their ability to do that mapping.\xc2\xa0 And I think she considers that a priority.\xc2\xa0 But, Carol, would you like to comment?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 She said the same thing, and certainly, it\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99re going to look at.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working with Congress to craft legislation right now.\xc2\xa0 It may be appropriate in that.\xc2\xa0 We also -- there will be a meeting of scientists -- it\xe2\x80\x99s now I think scheduled for June 3rd --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 June 3rd.</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 -- in Louisiana, bringing together scientists both from the government and outside the government to understand what questions we need to be asking as we go forward, and what resources we need to make sure are available.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 That will be a science summit at LSU on the 3rd of June.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And who will determine the scientists who are going to be there?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s being worked by an interagency team.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re soliciting input right now, just haven\xe2\x80\x99t finalized it yet. We\xe2\x80\x99re moving very quickly, though, to have it on the 3rd of June. We can make that known to you.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that this is -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantees and this is an accident of a magnitude that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen before.\xc2\xa0 Is it time to ask BP right now to start paying?\xc2\xa0 Because Congressman --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, ask who to start paying?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 BP to start paying --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They\'re paying right now.\xc2\xa0 They are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s saying -- but he\xe2\x80\x99s saying that they need to start now and have big -- pay out the exhorbitant amount of money starting now, versus paying smaller amounts throughout time if that\'s the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know how much the cleanup has been, but my guess is their accountants would think that that\'s been exhorbitant and that\'s being paid as we speak.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 There have been multimillion-dollar grants made to all the states that are impacted, as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because he\xe2\x80\x99s saying he --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute, I have a follow-up.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s saying it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get worse before it gets better, much, much worse.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Undoubtedly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the case?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, some of these grants have been advanced by BP knowing that there\xe2\x80\x99s a much larger -- they\xe2\x80\x99re partial claims, knowing that there will be more due later one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When is the President expected to go to the Gulf Coast to make an assessment himself?\xc2\xa0 And also who from the White House is on the ground with you, Admiral Allen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say this.\xc2\xa0 As you heard, there\xe2\x80\x99s a federal on-scene coordinator, Rear Admiral Landry, in Robert, Louisiana, which is where the President visited on his trip a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 This afternoon, as we speak, Secretary Salazar, Secretary Napolitano and Administrator Jackson are in the area and may be CEQ Director Sutley -- I will double-check -- is that right?\xc2\xa0 And I think people will go in and out of the region.</p>\n<p>As I started this by saying, were it not for change of commands, Admiral Allen would be speaking to us via speaker phone from Louisiana itself.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when is the President going?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If there are changes to that schedule, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then you\xe2\x80\x99re anticipating --</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 Let me just add one other thing.\xc2\xa0 There is a daily conference call.\xc2\xa0 Every evening, the Admiral, myself, John Brennan, Secretary Napolitano, Salazar, Jackson -- every night we\xe2\x80\x99re on the phone.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And the call that was done today with the President with the governors of the states is done on a daily basis through the Office of Public Engagement.\xc2\xa0 Admiral Allen is generally on that call and speaking with the five governors so that if there are points of cause and concern, they are brought directly here on that call.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a readout from that call?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We will have that, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there an expectation at some point that the President will go?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He might, he might, yes.</p>\n<p>Let me go to Tommy because we\xe2\x80\x99re -- let me work the back of the room here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 First of all, are you going to brief on other topics after this or is this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a question on another topic, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to shoot.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, I have three questions then.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just three?\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we pick our most important and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if there\xe2\x80\x99s other topics on oil that -- while we have these guys here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I have one on oil.\xc2\xa0 Can I do one on oil and one not on oil?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just do it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral Allen --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Does that count as one of your questions?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral Allen, you said earlier that if the -- if you guys issue an administrative order it has the effect of law.\xc2\xa0 And my question is, what penalties does BP face if they either don\xe2\x80\x99t comply with that administrative order if they comply too slowly?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I can go and get you the actual cites.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I have them top of my head right now, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are both civil and criminal penalties that could be invoked.\xc2\xa0 We can get that information to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Robert, over the weekend in responding to Sarah Palin on the subject of the oil spill, she said that -- she asserted that the White House had been slow in responding and made the assertion it was because of campaign donations, and you said that she needed to become more well-informed.\xc2\xa0 But this is I think the third time someone -- or fourth time someone on FOX News has made a similar assertion.\xc2\xa0 Do you think at this point the problem is a lack of information or something else?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A lack of information on what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the response of the oil spill.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s saying that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Every day for almost a month, we have sent out to each one of you all from the Joint Information Center exactly what is done each day on the response. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think if you hear Admiral Allen speak for about 30 seconds you realize the Coast Guard and the federal government have been there since this accident happened, since that rig exploded and caught fire on April 20th.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lack of information if you believe somehow that that response didn\xe2\x80\x99t begin at the very point of this accident.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- what do you think though is behind the continued assertions that there was some nefarious purpose and that you delayed and there was --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard people on -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard people say -- not want to offer conspiracy theories but say somehow that we\xe2\x80\x99ve delayed our response for whatever reason.\xc2\xa0 There have been notions made by people that even this was done intentionally.\xc2\xa0 You know, again, I -- you got to have a license to drive a car in this country but regrettably you can get on a TV show and say virtually anything.</p>\n<p>Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One is, you put out a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You want to license pundits?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regulate them.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Speaking of blowout preventers.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One is, you put out a fairly harsh statement towards the end of last week about Republican senators holding up this raising of the liability cap. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the White House has done at all to actually move that legislation on the Hill, other than the statement.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with -- do you have something?</p>\n<p>MS. BROWNER:\xc2\xa0 We will actually -- yes, we have been working with Congress and we will actually have three administration officials testifying tomorrow morning before the Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me see if there\xe2\x80\x99s any additional calls that Legislative Affairs have made on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then the second question is, going back to offshore drilling in the future, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m just sort of shocked -- you said that the President has to wait until the investigation comes back before deciding how he\xe2\x80\x99s going to approach this issue in the future.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there enough empirical evidence right now that you have seen or that he has seen to make him at least second-guess or look at his decision to do offshore drilling in the first place?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s been enough evidence for him to look at it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he asked the Department of Interior to conduct what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done while the engineers are doing their stuff and while, to ensure the independence of any review that\xe2\x80\x99s done, we\xe2\x80\x99ve appointed an independent commission to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Sam, understand a couple of things:\xc2\xa0 30 percent of our domestic oil production comes from the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked here about the fact that for many years we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the luxury of not having any accidents.\xc2\xa0 We need to figure out why -- after all those years, why did this accident happen.\xc2\xa0 And that should, and will, inform what we do moving forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The mindset hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed in the slightest at all?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t imagine that that hypothetical statement would be backed up by anything I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the last three weeks.</p>\n<p>Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just quickly on Korea.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of any updates or conversations the President has had today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President spoke -- obviously has had his intelligence briefing and spoken with the national security team; he spoke with President Lee last week; obviously, the statement that we put out very early in the morning after President Lee spoke to South Korea.\xc2\xa0 We believe that North Korea should stop its belligerent and threatening behavior.\xc2\xa0 We support President Lee\xe2\x80\x99s actions.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton will be traveling to the region and see President Lee very shortly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken with Secretary Clinton while she\xe2\x80\x99s traveling in China?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m from Germany, and all the world is observing how the U.S. is handling the spill.\xc2\xa0 Admiral, do you see any country out there which has a higher expertise on deep-water drilling that could be of any help?\xc2\xa0 And the other side of this question is, if there is no other country, that means also no other country takes the risks of offshore deep-water drilling in the same sense as the U.S. is doing?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I want to address the policy issues associated with deep-water drilling.\xc2\xa0 A couple of things we have done:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked my staff to take a look at the other regulatory regimes around the country -- around the world and how certain countries treat the regulation and inspection of blowout preventers and drilling systems.\xc2\xa0 The other thing we\xe2\x80\x99re taking a look at is there is an international body very similar to the International Civil Aviation Organization -- it\xe2\x80\x99s called IMO, the International Maritime Organization.\xc2\xa0 We are a signatory to that convention.\xc2\xa0 They establish international standards for a lot of different things including drilling systems.</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go back and compare the U.S. domestic inspection regime with the regimes of other countries -- let\xe2\x80\x99s say the Marshall Islands -- and in some cases, compare that to international standards that are out there, and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s any kind of re-leveling that needs to be done.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of this anecdotally, so I don\'t want to say with absolute certainty, but I do -- I\xe2\x80\x99m under the impression that Norway actually has a regulatory system for blowout preventers.\xc2\xa0 So we would look at things like that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, guys.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s asking whether you\xe2\x80\x99re actually consulting with them to try to plug the hole --</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- with other countries that have expertise.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re bringing all expertise to bear.\xc2\xa0 Yes, we are.\xc2\xa0 I would have to go back and check exactly who has been at the table.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll give you that answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you like retirement?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know when --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One question -- a lot of people have been saying that the administration has not been tough enough on BP.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll give you two examples:\xc2\xa0 the fact that the EPA order was ignored --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 Understand, Jake, just go back and read the letter.\xc2\xa0 There is a time period I think of 72 hours to go through this -- these guys are -- they\'re meeting -- they were meeting late last night, and will I believe in about -- my watch is set about five minutes fast, so in about 10 minutes Administrator Jackson --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was also --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also the live feed that didn\'t come until 10 days after you guys initially requested it.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, not everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked for they\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xc2\xa0 And what do you say to -- even supporters of the President say you guys have not been tough enough on BP?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Admiral Allen can tell the story of -- or he told the story of speaking with the CEO of BP, if he believes something needs to happen, and that that behavior is changed.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Maybe a good example -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a group set up called the flow rate technical group.\xc2\xa0 There have been a lot of issues about 1,000, 5,000 barrels.\xc2\xa0 Frankly, from the start we responded much higher than that, so it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t consequential to the response.\xc2\xa0 It is going to be very consequential to the total amount of oil we think is out there in terms of natural resources damage -- damage assessments and mitigation.\xc2\xa0 For that reason we\xe2\x80\x99ve stood up a team.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s headed by Marcia McNutt, who is the head of the U.S. Geological Survey. And they are putting together the best estimate from satellite imagery, over-flights, looking at the video imagery that\'s available from BP -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s only two-dimensional.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to actually figure how many frames per second we\xe2\x80\x99re actually looking at so we can try to establish the density of the flow at any one time and differentiate gases from the other hydrocarbons.</p>\n<p>That\'s all being worked right now, and what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to come up with -- it will probably be a range of some assumptions attached to it of what we believe to be the best government estimate of not only the flow rate, but the total amount of oil that\'s been released to date.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you tough enough with BP?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 When we need information from that group, we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked for it and they\xe2\x80\x99ve delivered.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, guys.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you reflected on the fact that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The flow rate -- just let me --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finish flow rate --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think sometime this week.\xc2\xa0 Again, as was said on the call with the President, they\'re going -- they\'re looking at the actual flow rate, they\'re looking at average flow rates, they\'re looking at total volume of oil spilled.\xc2\xa0 Again, what the Admiral talked about is initial estimates were based off of -- over satellite photos and over-flight photos that are obviously one-dimensional.\xc2\xa0 The video is in many ways one-dimensional.</p>\n<p>So the best and the brightest, headed by Marsha McNutt, the director of the U.S. Geological Survey, with a team of scientists are the flow rate technical group that are finding out many of the answers to that rate, understanding that there are a lot of things that are involved in, once a flow rate is determined -- as you heard the Admiral say, it\xe2\x80\x99s, quite frankly, less to do with response but it does impact ultimately on the penalties that the company provides.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Admiral, have you used your veto against BP?\xc2\xa0 You said you had veto power.</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 Not for a veto yet, though.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you met with the President today?</p>\n<p>ADMIRAL ALLEN:\xc2\xa0 No, not today.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n4:22 P.M.
