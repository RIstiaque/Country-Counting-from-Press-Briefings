EDT</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n<br/>\n\t\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 So why don\'t you just fire away?\xc2\xa0 Any interesting questions?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, we\'ve got to think of something.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are we expecting tonight, Bill, in Mexico?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'d say, broadly, the purpose of this summit is for the President to have an opportunity to speak with his counterparts about issues of mutual concern like H1N1 preparedness, economic competitiveness, security, and also global climate change.\xc2\xa0 And so tonight they\'ll have a open and wide-ranging discussion on those topics and probably some other things will come up.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President had any updates or gotten involved at all in the Hudson River crash?\xc2\xa0 Anything that he learned about that before he left?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, he has been briefed on the issue and obviously I would stay in touch with NTSB and FAA for any further updates on information, but, yes, he\'s been briefed.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have any new initiatives that he plans to put on the table here, or is this a follow-up to the meetings that he had with Calder\xc3\xb3n and Harper earlier this year?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point out that the President has made it a point to focus in on issues important to this hemisphere, and together with his counterparts in Canada and Mexico -- he\'s met with those leaders a combined dozen times.\xc2\xa0 So this is one part of an ongoing discussion to talk about some of the things that are specifically time-sensitive, as I mentioned before, and it\'s a conversation that will keep going.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tObviously President [sic] Harper will be coming to Washington in September.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see them at the G20.\xc2\xa0 So this is part of an ongoing conversation.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On trucking, certainly that will be some of the discussion between the two leaders.\xc2\xa0 What is exactly the administration doing with Congress to work on the resumption of the pilot program?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if I fully heard your question, but here\'s the answer I\'m going to give you -- (laughter.)</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you think this is, your birthday?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President -- obviously this issue is going to come up and the President is committed to making sure that we fulfill our international obligations and that any regulations and so forth that are put into place are consistent with our agreements.\xc2\xa0 And so we look forward to talking about a wide range of economic issues tonight and tomorrow.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, can you say anything about the plan the administration is going to send to the Hill on better assessing how successful the Afghan and Pakistan war is going to be?\xc2\xa0 There were reports about that this morning.\xc2\xa0 How are you going to measure how well you\'re doing.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point out that, first of all, there are metrics in place right now, and we\'re obviously making progress.\xc2\xa0 And I want to make clear the reason that we\'re in Afghanistan is because the people who plotted 9/11 are still operating there, and ultimately we\'re there to protect Americans and put those terrorists out of business.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tGeneral McChrystal has been on the ground, as General Jones talked about earlier today.\xc2\xa0 And like any good commander, he\'s doing a thorough assessment of how things are going, and that will obviously be coming forward soon.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll continue to discuss the metrics and the progress that we\'re making in Afghanistan with Congress.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Pakistan, does the President have any reaction to sort of what\'s happening with the Taliban leaders there?\xc2\xa0 I think General Jones this morning said that he confirmed that the leader in Pakistan was killed.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure the President also knows that. Any reaction in sort of -- was there confirmation of that?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think what General Jones said was that he was pretty sure that he had been killed.\xc2\xa0 And obviously Mehsud was a murderous thug, and his elimination is a step forward for the safety of folks in that region and in our country.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tSo this is obviously -- this also shows that Pakistan has made progress in moving to root out and eliminate extremist elements in their country.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to partner with them to keep doing just that.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When does this go from "pretty sure" to "sure"?\xc2\xa0 When will the government know if that has happened?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not an expert on something like that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if we\'ll ever know for sure.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\'s some conflicting reports that are coming out of the region.\xc2\xa0 But like I said, we\'re pretty sure, and obviously that\'s a victory for safety and security in the region.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, this morning General Jones said that the United States had expressed its concern to Iran about the three hikers. How did we express those concerns?\xc2\xa0 Was it directly through the Swiss or through another intermediary?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve obviously sent a strong message to Iran that they should immediately release those individuals, as well as other Americans that they\'re detaining.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get into the specifics of every single issue like this, but I will say that there were strong sentiments conveyed and I assume received.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what -- just publicly, do you mean, strong sentiments conveyed?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 All right?</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Happy birthday.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div>\n<div class="legacy-para">\n\t\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\t4:30 P.M.
